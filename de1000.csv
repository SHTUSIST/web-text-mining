0,What are the shortcomings of the Democrats and Republicans?,Democratic Party vs. Republican Party,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Both put party before country. Biggest case in point, they actually cooperate to make it harder for any other political party to get a foothold. They refuse to attend a Presidential debate if a third party is invited. They have worked to eliminate ranked choice voting (did you know it used to be common?)Both are captured by the moneyed class. Campaign finance reform on a truly massive scale is required before any politicians can do anything remotely like representing their constituents—you know, their job.Citizen’s United has basically put out a contract hit on both parties’ ability to represent the people.Democrats keep making the mistake of charging to the right, on and on, trying to keep the Republicans in sight as they charge so far to the right they’re running out of right to run to. Democrats are terrible at the message. They have the disadvantage that they know that complex problems do not often have simple, sound-bite solutions. The Democrats should be moving hard left and welcoming the progressive wing with open arms, not trying to shut them out. That will make them stay home in droves on Election Day.Republicans are very good at politics—This is not a compliment. They are great at campaigning, message, propaganda, and gaming the system via gerrymandering and utterly shameless advantage. North Carolina isn’t even considered a democracy any more, it’s so bad. The US is fading back to “developing nation” status under Republicans, and everything they do seems designed to prevent America from ever being great again.Republicans are the self-confessed party of government saboteurs. They have no idea how to run a government because they want to destroy it. They insist that the machinery of government doesn’t work, after taking a sledgehammer to it first—self fulfilling prophecy.The elections keep going to the party that makes one fewer royal screwups than the other party that election cycle. Neither party is fit to govern, but the Democrats at least try sometimes, when their corporate masters allow them to.Some day I would like to have someone to vote for, instead of against.",50,0,347,"1,385",0,0
0,What are the shortcomings of the Democrats and Republicans?,Democratic Party vs. Republican Party,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"I'd say for the Democrats is underestimating Trump and not embracing, fully, the liberal wing of the party. Additionally, now Democrats seem unsure on what action to take against Trump.As for the Republicans they’ve, by in large, been utterly contemptible. They've defended Trump for political purposes. Many have also taken up Trump’s favorite hobby (besides Tweeting of course): tearing down integral democratic institutions. The short-term gain may be favorable but the long-term result may leave America less stable and worse off. Simply, they're on the wrong side of history right now.",19,0,11,292,0,0
5,Why does Israel support Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw America from the UN Human Rights Council?,UN Human Rights Council,United Nations,Human Rights,1!,1!,1!,"Here are the member nations of the human rights council: Afghanistan Angola Australia Belgium Brazil Burundi Chile China Côte d’Ivoire Croatia Cuba Democratic Republic of the Congo Ecuador Egypt Ethiopia Georgia Germany Hungary Iraq Japan Kenya Kyrgyzstan Mexico Mongolia Nepal Nigeria Pakistan Panama Peru Philippines Qatar Republic of Korea Rwanda Saudi Arabia Senegal Slovakia Slovenia South Africa Spain Switzerland Tunisia Ukraine United Arab Emirates United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland United States of America (for now) VenezuelaNow some of those nations are great places but others have no business being on a council dictating human rights. All might be fine and dandy in Switzerland for human rights. Saudi Arabia has terrible human rights records for women and mass executions on the regular. Also every single Muslim nation (all with questionable human rights on homosexuals and women) on it leans on Israel for every shot fired in Gaza and every dead Palestinian is an obvious war crime no matter what the Palestinian was shot for.While Muslims roam freely in Tel Aviv where are the Jews in Riyadh? Karachi? UAE? Afghanistan? Not present or driven underground due to lack of human rights. These member states are begrudging Israel for anything it does because they, as a culture, do not approve of Israel's right to exist at all. They despise Jews as descendants of the wrong son of Abraham. Putting them on the human rights council is a great way to stick it to the Israelis and see if they can drive them into the sea from the UN. That is the why.Brass tacks now.Understanding the animosity that dates back thousands of years is difficult at best. A culturally inculcated abject dislike for a people and a nation is beyond the scope of what most westerners can even comprehend. Since they cannot comprehend it they choose to believe it does not exist rather than dip a toe in the water and see how hot the current is which is way is moving and who is most wrong. Peoples need a place. Every people needs a place. If the Jews do not get Israel, and that's what this is all about, where do you suppose they should live. Muslims have 2 dozen nations to move from one degree of Sharia to the next. Jews 1. The most maligned nation on Earth and it is the last holdout of the most historically persecuted people (while other (most)peoples have been persecuted none for 3000 years). For over 3000 years the Jews have been captured, enslaved, released, recaptured, judged, tormented, re-judged, trampled by Romans, Ottomans, Persians, and then holocausted (I made it a verb). They do not get a country though? The UN human rights council was mainly a tool to malign Israel as again the council nations have glaring violations to women and homosexuals (neither of which the Israelis have). Israelis it seems only have a problem with people are launching rockets, incendiary kites and otherwise trying to actively combat them in a cultural full-court press to drive their cousins into the ocean and off their land because they are incapable of cohabitation as Saudi Arabia proves with its utter lack of Jewish people.I am a westerner. Granted. I have seen this for what it is for a long time. A cultural hate war that mainly blows one way. While Muslims can live and work and play in Tel Aviv, Jews cannot in Karachi or any in almost all other Muslim nations with the exception of two or three more moderate nations (Turkey and Jordan). Any westerner should find that data point to be a head scratcher at best and an affront to human rights at worst. Compound that with exactly where do you want the Jews to dwell if not in Judea. Where do you want their reservation to be and with what force to plan to push them to it with... Why do the Palestinians always want one more acre, one more village a little bit more of the west bank. Push them into the sea! That is why and that is the stated goal.",148,3,30,484,0,0

1,Is the sudden recent hysteria by Democrats about immigration just a desperate attempt to distract Americans from the stunning revelations of political bias by senior FBI officials working to elect Hillary Clinton despite her crimes?,Political Bias,Bias,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,"Mr. Stewart you are wrong on the facts.The “stunning revelations” in the Inspector General’s Report were that James Comey breached established FBI protocol in a way that harmed the Clinton campaign to the benefit of the Trump campaign, when he announced that Clinton was under investigation and did not announce the ongoing investigation of Candidate Trump.And that Comey again breached established FBI protocol to announce eight days before the poll that the investigation of Clinton was being reopened and again benefited the Trump campaign.Another “stunning revelation” was that the IG confirms that there is quite literally NO evidence that Hillary Clinton has ever committed even the most trivial crime.",53,6,182,"1,449",0,0

It is “sudden” because this disgusting practice has not been the practice of any prior administration (and don’t even trot out that stupid Clinton/Obama lie - Did this supposed enforcement during those administrations magically stop during Baby Bush’s?). It is “hysteria” because rational people are, rightly to my mind, seeing disturbing echoes of the Nazis and internment camps. And it is not just “Democrats” it is every right thinking, compassionate human being who find this VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS beyond the pale.Personally, I hope that this is the death knell for a Republican-held House and Senate come this fall.

1,Do you think Democrats would care about illegal immigrants if they thought they'd vote for Republicans?,Illegal Immigration,Voting,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,"I’ve often heard the argument that Democrats support illegal immigration, or are lax enforcing laws against it, because visible minorities predominantly vote Democrat. Perhaps I’m naive, but I never fail to be appalled by this argument.I had a discussion with someone the other day who swore that 10 million illegal immigrants voted for Hillary Clinton in California and that’s how she got the popular vote. Hillary received 8.7 million votes in California, total, out of a population of 40 million[math]^1[/math]. Add to that that while there are an estimated 10 million immigrants in California, half of those are naturalized citizens with full voting rights, and another quarter are non-citizens but live in the United States legally.The study everyone quotes which claims millions of undocumented immigrants voted illegally is actually extrapolated from a questionnaire where 38 non-citizens (both documented and undocumented) either claimed to have voted or were verified to have voted in the 2008 presidential election between Senators McCain and Obama [math]^{2,3}[/math]. Of those, the researchers estimated 21 actually voted illegally, and of those they could only confirm five. That’s five individuals. Not five hundred. Not five thousand. Five.From this they made an estimate of 2.8 million illegal votes with a completely whacked out uncertainty range also of 2.8 million people, asserting anywhere between 38 000 and 2.8 million voted illegally.Someone else took the same data of 21 estimated illegal votes with five verified, used an upper range for estimates of undocumented immigrants, and upped the estimate to 5.7 million illegal votes nationwide. It is totally insane to place any confidence in these numbers given the sample size, and using extrapolations that I don’t think even exclude children, but it sold like hotcakes. As far as I understand, apart from these estimates there is no established evidence for any significant illegal voting.I can’t speak for political leaders, but I think Democrats are driven, in general, by their desire for the fair and equitable treatment of all peoples. It is certainly my belief that the high values most Americans purport to cherish, values such as due process, as “all men are created equal,” as freedom of speech and religious belief, as self-determination, as basic human rights and freedoms, are hollow and hypocritical if they are only to be applied to American citizens.Further, few people actually want anyone to enter the country illegally, but I think Democrats feel many Republican politicians have unjustly turned the issue into a national boogeyman, using undocumented immigrants as scapegoats and political pawns.All groups of immigrants, regardless of skill or origin, have been shown to create net job growth. All groups of immigrants, regardless of skill or origin, have been shown to have lower per capita crime rates and violent crime rates than native born Americans.Obviously America can only resettle so many people and illegal immigration does open the country to drug trafficking and fugitives. I don’t know of any Democrat who has said they wanted open borders with respect to immigration. Open border comments I have heard refer to free trade, as when Hillary Clinton was misrepresented using the phrase.So yes, I believe Democrats in general care about the welfare of undocumented immigrants out of ideology and compassion, and don’t actually give thought to their voting preferences. I also believe Democrats do care about immigration laws, but believe in extending considerations to those who would be in danger if they were turned away, to children, and to those who are established and know of no other family or life than they have built in the United States.Democratic leaders also reject signing legislation that would fund a wall and refuse to be extorted into doing so, not out of apathy towards the laws, but out of acknowledgement that a wall would be both ineffective and expensive. It would serve as a symbol that doesn't represent American values, potentially increasing animosity towards the United States and in doing so, making America less secure. Finally, if the costs of the wall were somehow placed on Mexico, it would actually worsen the problem of illegal immigration and supply more workers to drug cartels by increasing poverty in Mexico.I know many hate this quote. I know many are going to cringe. But I present it for a reason. Read it with me.“Give me your tired, your poor,Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me,I lift my lamp beside the golden door!”This is what makes America secure; this is what makes America prosperous: When America represents hope to the impoverished and the oppressed and to their relatives for a better life; when people from all walks of life come together to better themselves.Making America a place where children are separated from their parents, where people are treated callously and discharged to uncertain fates, makes people resentful and places Americans at greater risk.[math]^1[/math] Presidential Election Results: Donald J.

3,"Did the ignorance of 2 FBI agents cost us the opportunity to ""harm"" Trump like Peter implied he wanted? How could 2 trained agents fail so ignorantly at general OPSEC? Is their stupidity justifiable?",Operations Security,HUMINT,Occupy Democrats,1!,1!,1!,"The entire conversation is unfortunate but being used for political posturing. The two lovers in question seemingly did not like anyone and slammed people from all political perspectives. All people have opinions, and if professional, do not let these opinions affect their official duties and actions. The IG report says Comey acted inappropriately for impacting the election in the favor of Donald Trump especially by releasing the October 28, 2016 letter about Anthony Wiener’s laptop. This impacted the election. Nate Silver says this caused a 1–2% shift in votes in an election won by 78000 votes. Why did Comey release this letter? Because the New York FBI field office was vehemently anti-Clinton and would have leaked the information if he had not. Can we see all of the emails of the New York FBI field agents? Think there would be any comments about HRC that would be objectionable? How about Gowdy and those running the Benghazi hearings? Anything negative there? The question is not the stupid things they said, did they do anything unprofessional to impact the campaign? The IG report says Comey did do something officially to impact the election. What exactly and specifically did they do to hurt Trump? The fact remains this. Only one Presidential candidate was under investigation on election day and it was not Clinton. Considering that the FBI investigation into Russian connections to the Trump campaign had started months earlier, and if many at the FBI was trying to hurt Trump, which is what the referenced conversation is being used to argue, why did the FBI not leak this information? The candidate hurt by improper actions by the FBI was Clinton, not Trump, based on Comey’s press conference and the release of the October 28, 2016 letter. The IG report concluded no political bias influenced FBI official decisions. The investigation as to how the New York FBI office acted to hurt HRC is still ongoing as is Guiliani’s contact with them.

1,Why didn't Democrats complain about these immigration policies when Obama enforced them?,Immigration Policy,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"Remember that Obama didn’t forcibly separate families. The Bush and Obama administrations took a wholly different approach. First, they’d accept asylum requests at the border (the Trump administration accepts them only at designated points of entry), and they would process undocumented immigrants under administrative procedure (the Trump administration has elected to treat all persons as repeat offenders, even if they are not, and attempt a criminal prosecution).The Bush/Obama protocol didn’t separate families (unless the parent had a violent criminal record), and the administrative process was much faster and cheaper (days to a couple of weeks instead of months to a couple of years, no public defenders or courts, lower cost facilities, etc.).People interpret the current situation as an intentional perversion of the law with the express purpose of exacting maximum cruelty and punishment (especially on children) to act as a deterrent. The Attorney General conformed this on the Sunday talk shows this week.Is what the current administration doing mandated by law? Not at all. Is it legal under current law? Mostly, with the possible exception of falsely charging first time offenders and the policy of deporting the parents but keeping the children — those will probably be found illegal when the matter gets to court.Why are people concerned?

This would leave a space for a new major party. As it is, the majority of Americans are already Independents.

I did know that there was some unfairness, but I had no idea of the extent of it. I was stunned, shocked, and outraged when I found out just how bad it was.In July of 2016, the Sunday before the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, I was at one of the largest protest marches in American history. We were marching down Broad St from one side to the other and several miles long. ( Broad St is very wide - if I remember correctly it has four lanes in each direction and a wide divider in the middle.) We were there because ""It is IMPERATIVE that we do not allow ourselves to be drawn into discussing the Democratic Primary in the false media narratives of lies and deceit woven to install Clinton into the Democratic Presidential nomination. The level of dishonest and corruption is vast. Clinton isn't winning, she is cheating and it is time to stop discussing theft as victory. We must STAND UP and protest en masse in Philly. ""We were chanting:HELL, NO, D.N.C!WE WON'T VOTE FOR HILLARY!Did this have any effect? The next day Bernie Sanders caved in and threw all his support behind the person we were protesting. Hillary Clinton had the opportunity to save herself by making him her VP, and by dumping the super PACS and other money from the wealthy and raised money the way Bernie did. (Why not? Bernie out raised her many times.) Had she done this she probably would be President today. But, as Tim Canova said:""You take a look at this establishment Democratic Party, and it's got a primary objective and a secondary objective. The secondary objective seems to be to try to defeat Republicans in general elections. If they can win those elections, that's great, if they can't, it is only a secondary objective.Their primary objective is to defeat progressive reform in primaries. And, that's because much of the establishment is owned and beholden to the same corporate interests that control Republicans as well.""Tim CanovaSo, she keeps the superPAC'S, picks Corporatist Kaine as her VP, and goes down in defeat.This is a good overview of what happened: Thomas Frank admonishes, 'Listen, Liberal!'

That is where I am torn. The Green Party is absolutely useless. I don’t know what their problem is, and I have given up on them. Starting a new “people’s party” sounds great until you try to do it - I have seen many pathetic attempts, none of which got anywhere.One thing is for sure - we need to get more people involved in the political process. We also need to focus on local candidates we know well who have small campaigns.

While not the result of lengthy reflection, at least for the specific question, three thoughts do come to my mind: a truly great president, education, and Congressional Term Limits.An absolutely great president would capture the hearts and minds of most (not all of course) American citizens. He or she would be exceptionally intelligent, have a grasp of the important issues, be surrounded by extraordinarily knowledgeable advisers (and listen to them), and appoint highly competent Cabinet members. He or she would listen to all sides of an issue, then make a decision based on the best interests of the country. This person would be honest and straightforward, able to stand up to other world leaders, but not to denigrate them. He or she would accept criticism and, as warranted, be able to change or modify a decision or policy. There would be no hint of egotism or self-aggrandizement in this world leader. This president would understand our Constitution and abide by its words and meaning, especially the notion of three coequal branches of government.Education. Starting in grade school, there needs to be an increased emphasis on civics classes. Students should have an intimate knowledge of government at all levels. They should be taught how political campaigns are conducted, why it is so important to vote (when there’re of age), and to make an informed vote.Congressional Term Limits. This topic, perhaps the most important of all options, should be pursued vigorously. If we can limit our President to two terms, why can we not impose similar restraints on our national lawmakers? It is common knowledge that our Representatives and Senators, at least most of them, see their positions as careers. While members of Congress have no Constitutional limits on how often they may run for reelection, it seems obvious that the Founding Fathers never envisioned career lawmakers. The irony, of course, is that it is only the members of Congress who can create Congressional Term Limits, something that they will resist.

So yes, Republicans would decry, denounce, smear, “Democratic Trump”. It’s what they do.Would I as a Democrat “believe” him? Believe what exactly? I am not a huge fan of Bill Clinton, though I voted for him twice. At least Clinton is informed, understands the role of government, and has occasionally supported policies I agree with. Trump is a habitual liar, intellectually incurious, does not understand how a republic functions, believes that the way to “win” is to cheat, and has “succeeded” in business mainly by starting out with $100 million, applying bankruptcy law aggressively, and avoid paying contractors when possible. He’s a bad person.Would I vote for Trump in some bizarro world in which the alternative was a Republican and an all around worse person? I would hope not, but honestly speaking, my vote is not a personal endorsement and I guess I would make whatever choice led to what I believed to be a better outcome. (A Trump/Kasich matchup? Maybe I’d just sit it out.) I would not pretend to like Trump any more than I really like Bill Clinton. I like Hillary Clinton more than Bill. I genuinely like Obama, our most intellectually curious president, and I have a deep admiration for Jimmy Carter, a man with deep compassion and moral depth. So there you go.

However, I disagreed on some of his policies and actions (including the over-use of drone strikes, his willingness to push for the TPP in secret, his eagerness to always try to reach compromises with Republicans even when they weren’t actually willing to give an inch, etc.), and I certainly didn’t just praise everything he did and come up with justifications for things that were objectively bad.

3,"If President Trump were a Democrat, would Democrats believe him and Republicans decry him?",Democratic Party (US politics),Republican Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"This is a pretty layered question, with a number of facets so I’m going to try and answer step-by-step.First, there are already several Republicans who have criticized Trump’s policies and demeanor. The ones who don’t have to deal with re-election (Sens. McCain, Flake, Corker) have been the most opposed to him because appealing to the Republican unity and identity doesn’t help them win an election in which they aren’t running.Second, Republican politicians have a track record of intense opposition to anything Democrat. Look no further than the senatorial race in Alabama in which Roy Moore lost to Doug Jones. Most of the established Republican leaders either avoided Moore’s, ahem, dating practices, or said that they didn’t need a Democrat in that position.Third, the Democrats are weak in the face of opposition. They can’t play the same hard ball politics that Republicans can (right now, Congress is skipping the summer recess to hurt Democratic incumbents in the midterms because there are more Democrats up for re-election, and the policy of separating children from their parents at the border is a bargaining chip for Trump to get funding for “the wall”).Fourth, the deregulation of banking, business, and environment along with the passing of tax cuts aimed at wealthy individuals is something a few Democrats are already fine with. The older, conservative Democrats such as Sens. Diane Feinstein and Joe Manchin have no problem with these specific policies, so there would be some celebration in this hypothetical (although progressive representatives would likely vote against these regardless).Fifth, this scenario is very unlikely if you assume Trump won the Democratic nomination. He would not. Keep in mind, the best examples of celebrity politicians (Trump, Reagan, Schwarzenegger) are Republicans. Oh, and forget the general election. Democratic voters don’t like Clinton, but Trump is something else.So I think this sums it up: Republicans would rail against Trump for everything (his demeanor, inexperience, intelligence), the Democratic praise would exist in pockets, depending primarily on the policies, and the scenario isn’t too likely in the first place.Also, “emocrat” needs to be a thing. Can we make that a thing?",158,1,3,6,0,0

They decided that gay people were evil and abortion was a sin. They tried to rule with religion and the Republican Party caved and let them do it. I personally don’t approve of abortion, but I don’t get to make that decision for someone else. And I absolutely do NOT understand why they hated and feared gay people so much. A great many people I care a lot about are gay. I just could not stand that kind of intolerance.I thought maybe I could be a Democrat. So I started going to sites like Huffington Post and communicating with people on the left to learn about what their beliefs are. After a year or so I came to the realization that if I thought Republicans were intolerant, the Democrats made them look like amateurs. The Democrats wanted to pigeonhole everyone and give them victim points. My daughter - gay, female, and a member of an Indian tribe - got major victim points. My brother, on the other hand, got VILLAIN points simply for the accident of birth that made him white and male. I heard ‘old, white man’ used as a bullying point. My father, a medic on Omaha Beach on D Day, was the devil incarnate because he was an old white man. I did not know what hate, bigotry, and intolerance were until I started hanging around with Democrats.I registered as an Independent. Neither party suited my needs, although lately the Republicans are much better than the Democrats. The Republicans finally gave up on the gay marriage thing and just shut up about it. Finally.

It is believed that John Kelley advised him on implementing the ugly practice.In a Twitter post, Trump stated: “Democrats can fix their forced family breakup at the Border by working with Republicans on new legislation, for a change!”It came the day after his administration said that it had taken nearly 2,000 children away from their parents, in a six-week period ending last month, as part of a new “zero tolerance” policy that refers for criminal prosecution all immigrants apprehended crossing the border without authorization.The White House defended the practice this week, saying the president was merely enforcing the law.

Understanding these A-typical categories of people will give you the insight to understanding why?The first group is based off those people mostly younger people. who have so called liberal values. such as working on solutions to world problems. like poverty, homelessness, global warming, and taking care of this planet, being aware and self conscious realistic issues that are valid arguments.They are un-aware and really only know what people tell them. Like most people today only relliy on 2nd hand information. nobody does research which they should. and people mistakingly think that googleing somtnhing is difinitive research when it is not!.They assume people on the right, or that are conservative are bad but in reality they hold the same values. And the truth is the right as you will find out in other paragraphs is not all good. people these days aren’t picking sides. left right thing is over dead.Everyone not liberal is just a concerned American and picks no one side. people may have conservative or libertarian values but are not right winged. And why should we? but they hold these same values. These are the associates to the more progressive liberal types which I describe in the next paragraph. and they really are on the fence and playing a cultural stereotypeThe second type are the activist and Geo political liberals. These are the ones who are more in doctrine by the liberal culture. and have fallen into thinking that political correctness and victimization, social justice is the definitive doctrine and belief. They think that democratic socialism (which is communism). Are values that should be implemented in this country. The watch shows like the young Turks who are named after a Turkish death squad who massacred tens of thousands of people in a genocide in a few hundred years back. Basically scramble messages and build characteristics that make absolutely no sense.These people tend to be narcissist and some are psychopathic. They push for anything liberal and associate anything that is not to their liking with out rationalizing.They tend to think their political views make sense becuase it connects with thier emotions. They belive that thier educational staus gives them leverage to promoting this type of thinking. basically making them erogant, egotistal people hence the nasricisim.for example like Gun control issue for instance. they disown law enforcement and talk down on government, but yet want to push to ban weapons that protect peoples lives so that law enforcement and government are the only ones who have them?I’m sorry if 3 bad guys with full intentions of raping and killing my wife and kids come in my house I should be able to protect myself with any means avilible and necessary that includes a gun.there are many thing that come with owning a gun like conservation, and respect. it is a tool an inanimate object and should be treated as such.They are the people who don’t understand that the fundamental principles of law that makes this country allows everybody a voice, and everybody access to their God given rights. The basic rights as such to believe, say, talk, wear clothes, act, protect, eat, sleep. work,play, create and do what ever it is they find relevant on their journey in life that make them the person they are or for instance the person you are as an individual?they lack the understanding of these fundamental principles and laws. which causes them to be manipulated more easily by the next group of people I mention.They also push to take away these fundamental principles based off the next category of people I will described. because they are event and emotionaly driven to follow the indoctrination. This is mainly to fulfill the need to fit in and be apart of something bigger then themselves because they really have no sense of accomplishment and have probably never really accomplishment anything significant in there life. which is important to a person character. to work hard and try and fail until something is accomplished?But more or less it is because these type of people cant be wrong nor like to be told what to do as I said ego, and narcissistic = sociopathic.They think that living in a society where every business works for the common good and everyone does a certain assigned job against there will is how our nation will ass send.While in the process having no real rationalization on this facile utopia which is in itself communism. forgetting that this would only work if a faction of people where to rule above them and control every thing (Hunger Games) and manage everything, and that this would kill innovation and take away a persons god given rights as explained above. until everyone gets bare minimum and resources are depleted.we can look to Venezuela they where lied to by there faction of leaders who sold the people on the idea of socialism and they are now eating rats and dogs literally. I have friends from their and they constancy tell me of how bad it is. They say it is like the apocalypse happened.This is what happens when you stomp out free enterprise and kill letting people use their talents and skills to earn there way in life.(back agian to that accomplishment thing?)In china (communist country) they tell citizens what job they must do. if you are they guy that cleans dog shit from the boots of the supreme emperor and your good at playing guitar to bad you must clean dog shit or be exiled,imprisoned, or put to death. sacrificing you rations of food and shelter. while being under full watch and rule of everything. If the government in china wants to watch you and your wife have sex you have no say so in the matter they have deemed all rights to do so.( for real)The other group is the political elite group. the people feuling the fake news media, and putting out propaganda and hate, lies about Donald trump attacking his charictor.

This is a group pf people who operate outside our constitution and nationalistic society.They control media outlets, news outlets, food, services, money, transportation and many other factions that make up the world we live in.they control what you see, what you eat, how you act, and even what you believe. they want a worker class of people who drown themselves in a chemical romance of prescription drug, alcohol, fast food, and tv shows that are proven to make humans dumber like bachelor or any MTV reality show.Trump is not one of these people. history proves and shows his father directly battling these archetypes of people protecting nationalism. Trump might be wealthy but he is not evil. and he knows who the evil people are and is exposing them, he has been restoring this nation back to you and I the people of this nation, and is steeping up to the world and taking back control that other leader like Obama have been caught seeking us out to.So to answer your question?Why do so many Liberals want President Trump to be a failure? because they where manipulated and lied to into thinking that the only person in 50 years who has undoubted proven to help and restore this nation back to the people. Is as evil and bad as they are. That and they are to egotistical to admit they are in the wrong! once a person lies, they must keep lieing to protect the first lie and on and on…The liberal leftist are the ones who have committed all these crimes. and it is coming into the light.

The effects of senility and indecision make him change policy weekly-often lying about what he said previously. He therefore fails to provide clear leadership.His leadership is irrational, like a child would lead. There is no purpose to what he does, like the election rallies his ego needs even after the election.

5,Why do so many Liberals want President Trump to be a failure?,Specific Presidents of the United States of America,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"If Trump had kept to some of his promises made prior to the election, things would be quite different. It’s not that Liberals wanted or want Trump to fail, it’s that the policies that he has put forward are so patently misinformed, badly implemented and potentially harmful to the nation as well as Democracy that his failure is the only hope.Take his stand on healthcare for instance. His promise was that we would get a new healthcare program that would not only cover everyone, but would be substantially better than the ACA and much cheaper. The result was a program that was at best equally or more expensive with much less coverage. In some ways, it was nothing less that cruel in its callousness to those in serious healthcare risk. Not only was it worse than the existing program, it was worse than what we had BEFORE the ACA. On top of it, Trump had nothing to do with it’s conception and had no idea what was even in the bill until it was brought up for a vote. Even he admitted that it was mean spirited!! The failure of this bill was preordained, and thankfully so.I might point out, that Trump and the GOP have continued to hack away at provisions of the bill that put those presently under coverage at risk. So, as spite for this failure, Trump has decided to punish us all by slowly sabatoging the existing bill with absolutely nothing to replace it.Likewise, Trump in addition to leaving hundreds of positions in government agencies vacant, his cabinet is filled with people who are diametrically opposed to the mission of the very agencies they are tasked to command. People like Pruit, DeVos, Perry, and Zinke are not just wholly unqualified for the positions, they are painstakingly dismantling provisions and laws specifically meant to safeguard the public from abuse and misuse by corporations.Consider the tax plan. Again, Trump had no hand in writing it other than vague overviews. The end result gave huge breaks to corporations and the rich, but little if anything for middle and lower income. The average American, the “forgotten” people Trump claimed to be concerned about, get what amounts to maybe $4000 more a yearwhile the rich get into the hundreds of thousands even millions. What’s more, the provisions for the upper class and corporations are permanent while those for the middle and lower class end in ten years, just about the time the shit hits the fan!And all this comes at a cost of a trillion dollar deficit!! From the party that is supposed to represent fiscal responsibility!There are numerous other examples like his racist and xenophobic immigration ban, the stupid con job on “the wall”, his dismantling of consumer credit protections, and of course the simply evil separation of immigrant families at the border.To hope for Trump’s failure is not ill will, or spite, or sour grapes, it’s a matter of self preservation.",360,30,76,871,0,0
5,Why do so many Liberals want President Trump to be a failure?,Specific Presidents of the United States of America,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Why do so many Liberals want President Trump to be a failure?I think you misunderstand the Liberal mindset, Stuart. Which is not all that surprising seeing as how so many Conservatives were desperate to see Obama fail during his eight years in office, not because they necessarily disagreed with his policies, but simply because they wanted to deny him the legacy of having accomplished anything positive while in office. This is known as “projection”:Psychological projection is a theory in psychology in which humans defend themselves against their own unconscious impulses or qualities (both positive and negative) by denying their existence in themselves while attributing them to others. For example, a person who is habitually intolerant may constantly accuse other people of being intolerant. It incorporates blame shifting.— Psychological projection - WikipediaWhen it comes to most Liberals, however, we really are focused on the specific policies that Donald Trump has espoused and attempted to put into place. So, yes, we hope he fails in his attempts to keep all Muslims out of the country. We hope he fails in his ongoing policies (or enforcement of policies, if you prefer) that result in thousands of children being separated from their parents. We hope he fails in his attempts to destroy the EPA. We hope he fails in his attempts to turn the entire government into one giant kleptocracy run by and for the rich and powerful. But that’s only because we honestly, truly believe that those policies and actions are bad things, regardless of who is doing them.On the other hand, most Liberals were guardedly optimistic about Trump’s recent summit meeting with Kim Jong Un, since it really would be wonderful to see the tensions between our two countries decrease and a denuclearization of North Korea would benefit the world at large. I mean, don’t get me wrong, we didn’t actually expect it to accomplish much, but we certainly weren’t hoping for the resultant failure we got.Similarly, most Liberals were hoping that Trump was serious when he made promises on the campaign trail about replacing Obamacare with a better system that would ensure increased coverage for everybody at lower costs. Again, we weren’t surprised when he spectacularly failed at that, but at the same time we certainly weren’t hoping that he would fail and we’d be left with the imminent collapse of Obamacare with nothing in place to replace it.Similarly, most liberals were hoping that, as a political outsider, Trump really would work hard to “drain the swamp” as he promised over and over again. Instead, of course, all he did was fail to keep his promise and instead appoint industry insiders to run his administration. But we really wanted him to succeed in fulfilling this promise.I could go on, but I hope you get my point. During the campaign, I was actually much more worried that Ted Cruz would be elected than Donald Trump, since Cruz was an extreme right-wing ideologue with the knowledge and expertise required to push through his agenda, whereas Trump as a bit of unknown who seemed to be willing to consider such “radical” ideas as preserving Medicare and Social Security, increasing healthcare for the poor and the aforementioned “draining the swamp.” The fact that Trump ended up being an abject failure in those things brings no joy to me whatsoever.",938,67,792,"3,219",0,1

Let’s consider recent developments:The Soviet Union is thirty years dead.Nuclear weapons are increasingly in the reach of third-world despots.The geopolitical frost brought about by the Cold War which froze over regional interests is going to melt away, sooner or later.The primary economic reason for America’s interest in the Middle East, energy imports, has been made superfluous by American shale.Most of our foreign trade dependent GDP is wrapped up in NAFTA (i.e., countries already of direct strategic concern to us).In this new world, we stand much more to lose than we do to gain by continuing our military commitments in Eastern Europe, Middle East, and the Koreas gratis. Poland recently offered two-billion dollars in exchange for a permanent American military presence; this could serve as a blue print for how we handle such relationships in the future.Trump wants the United States to adopt a more transactional position on foreign policy, and I agree.

2,"Why do people hate President Trump? Is it because he was a Democrat, a Republican, both, or neither?",Democratic Party vs. Republican Party,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Those people that hate President Trump might feel that way for dozens, if not hundreds of reasons, and I don’t have the space here to cover them all. I’d suggest as a broader explanation that much of that hatred is rooted in the titanic reversal of political expectations that occurred on Election Day 2016.The vast majority of pundits and political observers expected a Hillary Clinton victory on Election Day. Even the ever-cautious Nate Silver had put her chances of victory at 71.4%, predicting that she would take 302 electoral votes and 48.5% of the popular vote. (As it happened, he was within half a percentage point on the popular vote for Sec. Clinton, as she eventually collected 48%). And while anyone in politics will explain at length that anything can happen on Election Day, very few people expected a truly disruptive election result.Which means that a lot of people in this country suddenly felt like silver medal winners in the Olympics.Every two years, we get a series of stories explaining that bronze medal winners are typically happier with their result than silver medal winners. (One example from NBC News earlier this year: Want to be happier? Think like a bronze medalist). The reasoning is pretty simple when you think about it:Psychologists believe it stems from “counterfactual thinking,” or imagining the outcome that didn’t happen. Silver medalists focus on “I almost.” They can easily envision how they could have won the gold — nailing their landing, for example. So, they feel like they lost. Bronze medalists think “At least I.” They can picture not winning a medal at all. So, for them, third place is a win.Election Day 2016 meant that tens of millions of Democratic voters started thinking about how they almost kept the White House in Democratic hands. And that’s worse than losing by a mile!Layer on that President Trump has leveraged media sources extensively to drive news coverage in ways that are virtually inescapable, and those same voters are reminded constantly about how close they came.So, bottom line: President Trump’s Republican affiliation is tangential for most of the voters or others that hate him. In most cases, they weren’t going to vote for a Republican anyway.

(That isn't exactly what he supposedly said, but it's close enough.)I think what changed him are the same things that change a lot of liberals into conservatives as they get older.Like his stance on abortion. Yes, he used to say that he was pro-choice. Until someone he knew personally actually made the decision not to abort what would likely be a special needs child. And he realized how much worse his world might be without that child in it. I'm sure there was a lot more to it than that, but I could tell during the presidential debates that he was genuinely appalled at the thought of a late term or partial birth abortion.A lot of people, as they age, realize that the Republican platform represents more of their values than the Democrats’ platform.

It claims to be from a PEOPLE interview in 1998: “If I were to run, I’d run as a Republican. They’re the dumbest group of voters in the country. They believe anything on Fox News. I could lie and they’d still eat it up.”While it sounds like many things Trump HAS said, it’s not true. Trump always claimed he was a Republican who leaned Democrat on social issues.What changed was the discovery that social issues resonated more with the GOP base than traditional Republic battle cries like tax cuts. It took him a while to find the sounds the alt-right loves to hear, especially on issues like abortion. Remember this? Donald Trump took 5 different positions on abortion in 3 daysHis one gift is the ability to keep changing positions until he finds the one the crowd likes. And eventually he found the nasty, hateful core of the alt-right, and he never left.And never will. He knows how to read ratings (which is how he thinks of polls). He’s got the highest Own Party approval ratings since George W. Bush following 9/11. As long as the GOP keeps the Senate, that’s good enough to keep him from getting impeached.

So many things that came up during the primaries that our core values and a conservative holds appeared to be things he had never considered and and answered them very clumsily if not improperly for someone who is a conservative.I think his beliefs are still more in line with core liberal democratic values but he saw an opportunity to win the presidency as a conservative so he's playing the part of a conservative. for instance, it would be remarkable… It would take a monumental change in values to go from where he was in his political ideology to wear his policies indicates he is today. There aren't very many things that can change a person that much, one being if he found religion. But he has made it clear that he doesn't follow the fundamental Christian precept that you need to be repentant to be forgiven. As he stated in an interview on CNN, he doesn't believe in asking for forgiveness, he just believes in doing better. This doesn't indicate Christian conversion and he hasn't claimed to be anything else.One other thing I can think of that may have caused a values change for him is that he married Melania. I've seen some indicators that Melania is more conservative in someways but pretty liberal and someways too. Someone could make the case that she is changing him to be more conservative.Finally, I'd like to take umbrage a little bit at the suggestion that he is an alt right conservative. Maybe my impression of what defines an alt right conservative is different than yours. Actually I'd take umbrage at the assertion that Alt right people are conservative. At least in the big picture. The Alt in their name indicates it is an alternative. Which means they are not traditional conservatives. Traditional conservatives are not racist, the alt right is. Traditional conservatives are not into placing the collective over the individual. By extension then, traditional conservatives are not for trampling on one person's rights for the sake of a fringe group getting their way.

I have no idea if he doesn't like Mexicans or Central Americans, however he is big on making everyone follow the laws that he thinks are important and he's decided that our existing laws are important regarding immigration and he's going to enforce them with an iron fist. That doesn't necessarily mean he's racist. Or that he isn't racist. It just means he is enforcing the law. And to that degree I agree with him. What good our laws if you don't enforce them? How do you expect people to follow the laws they don't like if you let other people get away with breaking other laws?

Democrat politicians were rewarded with high commands regardless of their military experience. Ben Butler, Dan Sickles, were the best known. Andrew Johnson was the only Southerner to stay in the Senate. For his loyalty Lincoln put him on the ticket in 1864.During the war the Democrat loyalists opposed the passage of the 13th amendmentDuring reconstruction the two wings came together and made every attempt to stifle Black rights in the slave states. Johnson wanted to let the states come back and he opposed giving blacks the vote.During reconstruction local Southerner Democratic controlled law enforcment tried to disarm returning blacks, and give them no rights whatsoever. This resulted in the 14th and 15th Amendments being passed.The Klan was made of mostly of Democrats, founded by Democrats, to repress blacks.The fighting over the South finally came to a head in the Tilden Hays contest of 1876. The Republican controlled southern governments were accused of ballot box stuffing. This resulted in a confrontation that, depending on which historian you read, came close to a second Civil War.The (Alleged) compromise was the Republicans got Hays as President while the Democrats got a promise to withdraw all troops from the South.The result was all the reconstruction state governments collapsed and the Southern Democrats assumed control and enacted “Jim Crow” laws.

1,What specific plans of action do all of you who want to see Trump out asap have together for the 2018 elections?,Democratic Party (US politics),Democracy,Trump-Pence 2016,1!,1!,1!,"THIS WILL NOT STAND!Of course I cannot speak for “all of us” so I’ll have to answer the question in terms of what I think “should” be the focus of the upcomming elections. There is a point of view that those running for office cannot simply be AGAINST any given person or policy - they must be FOR a specific agenda that offers what their constiuents want for their futures. But I believe that this year demands we focus our attention on what must be stopped rather than what we might start. These are not “normal” times. Generally speaking what Republicans/ Democrats “stand for” has always (in my life time) remaind pretty consistant and well established so I won’t take the space here to go down that list of what each party stands for/against or why one side or the other is a better path forward for our country - those debates are time worn.One could easily create a 3 hour film to present/remind America what Trump has said, who he has appointed to run his administration (and their behavior), executive actions he has taken and the bald face lies he has repeatedly told since even prior to taking office. Our allies have reacted with shock and dismay over his conduct on the world stage. Trumps hard core supporters are having the time of their lives just now and will cheer him on as his conduct continues unabated - as it surely will. While each individual candidate will tailor their campaigns to appeal to their local constituents re: those traditional issues of importance - ( “it’s the economy stupid”, etc.) I think the common denominator across the country must be that the horror show we’ve been experiencing does not reflect who we are as a people - neither to our fellow citizens or our worldly neighbors. America IS a great country despite the mistakes we’ve made in the past born out of the fact that we’ve been the richest, most militarily powerful player on the planet. Trumps campaign slogan of MAGA is so ironic because he is so clueless about exactly what it is that has made America a “great” country.It is true that we all gravitate toward our own, individual self interests often tainted by our fears, maybe a little bit of greed and, certainly, our pride but I think those ideals upon which we were founded and tried to improve upon over time have “seeped” into our national consciousness as a nation. Having chosen Trump as our leader has brought us to a crossroad and I think it is one of the times in our history that we have to ask ourselves who we are as a people and how we intend to treat each other within our country as well as those who share this world with us. Lincoln insisted that a black man was an equal man and made us reveal wether we thought that was really true. We barely passed part 1 of that test but we did pass it (we are still working on but haven’t passed part 2 yet). Roosevelt asked us to sacrifice the lives of our sons and daughters in order to keep Europe from falling into the grip of fascism, it took us much longer than it should have and with much opposition but in the end we passed that test as well. While our leadership failed us on Vietnam our (primarily) young citizens dragged us into seeing the folly of our conduct and stopping it - we passed that one but with no better then a D- (and we turned that test in VERY late). Fear and rage born of 9/11 shoved us into the unjustified destruction of a nation - we don’t pass them all do we.The elections of 2018 will determine if we think Trump and his supporters are a fair and honest reflection of who we are and how we conduct ourselves as a people because that has become the most compelling question of our current times. Despite our past mis-steps as a country and the deserved criticisms we’ve received from many from time to time my country has by and large been admired throughout the world and I think (by and large) we have earned that admiration. I have not always been proud of how my country has conducted itself but I have always been proud of what we strived to be - it’s what has made me love America. Today I feel apologetic about my country, I’m embarrassed. I don’t feel like I’ve done anything to deserve that, I hate this feeling and it makes me angry that the conduct of others has made me feel this way. “My” strategy for 2018 to to put before he American people the choice between MAGA and what it has wrought, vs. MAKE AMERICA PROUD AGAIN and what it will take to bring back that feeling. We have a clear choice as a people and we should place that choice in the newspapers,on the airwaves and on the ballots. I don’t think America will disappoint us but we HAVE to ask her that question this year without fear that that question is just too esoteric for our citizens to understand or act upon.“America First” is represented by a wall and deportations, on tariffs, on getting the better of “other” guy. “America Best” is represented by the Statue of Liberty and compassion toward the “other” guy. There will be plenty of time for us to bicker about guns, a woman’s freedom to choose, a clean planet and how to properly treat people who are brown or gay.

It needs an edit.You appear to want to know if Trump is still going to build the wall. He says he already started. But he does not have the money for the whole wall, yet.Politifact says yes, but not the whole wall.

Although during the election campaign candidate Trump claimed that the wall would cost only $12 billion, a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) internal report in February put the cost at $21.6 billion, but that may be a major underestimate.The estimates vary so widely because of the lack of clarity about what the wall will actually consist of beyond the first meager Homeland Security specifications that it be either a solid concrete wall or a see–through structure, “physically imposing in height,” ideally 30 feet high but no less than 18 feet, sunk at least six feet into the ground to prevent tunneling under it; that it should not be scalable with even sophisticated climbing aids; and that it should withstand prolonged attacks with impact tools, cutting tools, and torches. But that description doesn’t begin to cover questions about the details of its physical structure. Then there are the legal fees required to seize land on which to build the wall.

2,Why is Trump taking the credit for work done by Obama on unemployment in the US?,Mike Pence (politician),The White House,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Well, at the very least you can see that Trump, so far, has done nothing yet to affect the course of unemployment set under Obama from 2010 on. Well, not much… job increases fell a little under Trump, but with the unemployment already nearly full when Trump took office, that was inevitable no matter who took the Presidency. At some point, the unemployment rate is self-inflicted, workers unable or unwilling to leave parts of the country without jobs and move to parts of the country where they’re having employee shortfalls. That also crosses skill sets.So certainly, if he existed, Honest Trump could claim to not have screwed anything up yet. He’s trying, with his trade war, so this victory lap may be short-lived, but so far, so good, on the unemployment front.As for why Trump would claim credit — you must be new here. Trump doesn’t even begin to understand how things work. He was claiming credit for a low unemployment a month after taking office, as if by the sheer force of orange-faced blotivating, companies scrambled to hire more people. That was, curiously, the same month Trump decided that the Federal Jobs Numbers were legit, not fake as he had claimed when Obama was in office. He really does seem to think he’s talking to uninformed childern with all the lies and stories he tells, not adults capable of a little research and critical thinking.Trump has a long history of it.This is a guy who crashed a charity event for kids with AIDS in 1996, jumped up on stage as if he were part of it, without having actually been involved or having donated a penny.Trump claimed he was responsible for the “safest year of air travel in history” for 2017, despite doing absolutely nothing to cause that, and also despite the US having the same commerical air travel record — no fatalities — since 2013, and no US run airline fatalities since 2009. In both of those years, there had been once accident involving fatalities.Trump claims to have invented the phrase 'Priming the pump'. That’s a phrase that goes back to the 1800s, and was used in reference to the US economy in the 1930s.He claimed to have invented “airplane rallies” — political rallies held at airports, usually set up with the plane behind the candidate. He accused Hillary Clinton of “copying me”. Thing is, Mitt Romney did airplane rallies. George W. Bush did airplane rallies. Johns McCain and Kerry… yup, sure enough, they did airplane rallies. Bill Clinton, yeah, him too. And before airplane rallies, candidate did train rallies. Nothing new to see here, folks.And yes, some of these may not even be intentional lies. Trump has shown very little understanding or awareness of a whole politicial tradition before he decided to run for President “just for fun”. When he doesn’t know that something existed before he “came up with it”, he will always claim it was his idea, his doing. He doesn’t understand things like economic momentum or, really, much at all business or the economy. Keep in mind, this was a guy who was basically a snake oil saleman and conman in business. His business model in construction was to rip off all the contractors so he could build cheap. He once ran a public company, when he conned investors to buy into “Trump Resorts”, his failing casino business, just to get his money out. He was CEO at the very start, but found himself out on his keester in short order, with the company licensing his name. His more recent success was as a TV game show host for 13 years. He doesn’t even seem to have a real grasp on the concept of cause and effect. If he did, he’d stop torpedoing the things he’s supposedly trying to get done with destructive tweets.As far as the effects of things Trump’s done? Well, what has he actually done that’s had any effect?The trade war he’s trying to start is really just a skirmish right now, but China’s already showing they’ll match us tariff for tariff, so if he wants war, he’s got war… and against the entire world, the USA doesn’t win that war.The Big Republican Tax Cut, which he signed but otherwise had little to do with, that’s put a very small amount of money into middle class pockets, which does boost the real economy. 85% or more of it’s gone to the wealthy, though, which really has little effect on the economy — it’s more money in my bank account or gambled on the stock market. Those cuts will fade out over the next three years.The so-called deal with North Korea is the stupidest of the seven or so denuclearization deals the US has had with North Korea since they signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Pact in 1985, but proceeded to ignore it. Trump’s one page document basically says that the DPRK will “commits to work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.” That is the total and complete extent of the nuclear part of the agreement Trump signed. There’s no timetable. No inspections. No guarantee of any kind. About the only positive effect of this agreement is that Trump thinks he’s accomplished something, because he’s completely ignorant of the details agreements of the past that the DPRK simply ignored (or the Republicans refused to pay for). So at least we’ll have Trump no longer trying to prod the DPRK into war, which does make the world safer. Maybe not as safe as if absolutely any other 2018 candidate were President — or my cat Juno — but safer than it was, given the status quo.Trump toutes that wages are up. Well, they were in the first three quarters of 2017, continuing the trend that began under Obama’s second term. Then they fell again in the fourth quarter, more than wiping out the previous gains.The stock market has been relatively high, and yes, according to Trump it’s all him. Some bits of it, maybe, early last year. Yeah, it’s been up and down, but still hit some records, again, following the trajectory of the trend under Obama. And absolutely bolstered as well by the Republican Tax Cuts. But what people miss, since Trump took office, is the deflation of the value of the dollar. In 2017, the dollar fell by 10%, while the Dow Jones peaked nearly 25% over 2017, close to 25,000, before settling down, then back up… it’s close to 25,000 today. That of course, represents no significant gain from 2017, but still, it’s doing well, until you look at the value of the dollar. When the dollar drops, that doesn’t instantly mean that the international value of an internationally traded stock suddenly falls — Google didn’t lose 10% of its value in 2017, the dollar did. So the stock prices adjust to compensate, at least for large international compaines. And that actually inflates the pricing on Wall Street, but it’s hidden to less savvy investors.So now we have the looming trade war. Tariffs will essentially mean that, despite out low dollar that would ordinarily help US exporters, the dollar looks high to international buyers but low to investors. That combination means that no one wants dollars, and it’ll drop the value of the dollar even further. And domestic manufacturers, paying that tariff, will gradually be raising prices domestically, in conjunction with much steeper oil prices. Trump isn’t claiming credit for these, but they absolutely do belong to him. This could be headed off, there’s always a chance that Trump’s blundering around with tariffs is just a bad negotiating tactic, or that Congress will take away his ability to levy tariffs, since he’s clearly abusing that power. We’ll see, but this could be the big economic news of 2018.How about all the money that went to corporations. The Republicans, including Trump, promised us that would all be spent on wages… well, most of it. Economists said it would all be spent on corporate stock buybacks… well, most of it. The Economists win, by about a 30:1 ratio! They pretty much always do. Science works, “my gut feeling”, not so much.

2,What do Republicans mean when they refer to 'school choice'? Do Democrats disagree with it and why?,Democratic Party vs. Republican Party,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"When progressives speak glowingly about our public schools, they are reflecting their satisfaction at having achieved the highest taxpayer funding in the world to implement a scheme designed two centuries ago specifically to avoid educating. When progressives here in the US moved schools under state control some six and eight generations back, they wanted the German Volksschule model designed to accustom non-aristocratic youth to that very state control. We now have an overwhelmingly progressive teacher corps not teaching our children to use their American rights and freedoms, not teaching them skills that could help them lead a life of self-reliance and not allowing them any exposure to the real world, per that very pernicious model.It is the idiocy of Republicans to look at the appalling results our school system achieves (compared with the education programs in other nations) and think it could be made to work if only we put the lid on tighter and did not allow it so much latitude. Also, we should have some schools that teach career skills, a good Republican value. When progressives don’t want to allow children out of their clutches to attend schools that might actually give them some ability to chart their own way in life, the Republican response is “school choice,” let families choose which statist poison they want for their kids.John Taylor Gatto more than twenty years ago told me that we as a nation “would be better off tomorrow if we shut down all the public schools today.” I was not prepared to agree at the time, but it did get me to thinking. The thinking was this, “If I want my children to succeed in the real world, I’d be smart to put them in the real world.” And that’s what we did. If you don’t like our educational “choices,” statism or statism lite, send your kids to the real world for their education.

2,What do Republicans mean when they refer to 'school choice'? Do Democrats disagree with it and why?,Democratic Party vs. Republican Party,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Republicans mean that they want THEIR children to have a different, better education.Most of the time, they define “better” as more fundamentalist Christian and segregated.I attended a parochial private Christian school from fifth grade forward. It was conservative and segregated and had school-led prayer. Those features added nothing to the school. My senior class was about 30 students. The next senior class had about 20 students.My school had some excellent features and these boil down to only two points.One is parental involvement. If parents pay extra to educate their children, they will support the school and they will encourage and support their children’s education. They will provide for structured study time at home in a proper environment. They will support school discipline and will not accept an excuse that the school is unfairly and badly treating their child — which is actually an uncommon event.Unfortunately, we cannot legislate parental support. We can encourage it and we can find ways to make it easier and more rewarding. We must do more. Paying teachers more and giving them respect — and holding them accountable — is a good start. We must communicate to our children that our teachers are more important than we have been doing.The second feature is smaller class size. This is a reward for good teachers because it is easier to teach small groups. Teachers want to teach. They do not want to be disciplinarians or baby sitters or prison wardens. Children get more individualized attention and assistance in smaller classes. They behave better and they engage better.Smaller classes should also exist in smaller schools. Schools are communities. If they are too large, children get “lost” and do not receive attention and assistance. Adults do not perceive when a child has a problem and needs help. In smaller schools, some children will have experiences they will not have in larger schools. More and smaller schools give more opportunities for any particular child to lead a club, or be on a team, or to receive recognition for achievements.Sports in a small school is less about professional sports farming and more about teamwork and participation.Some schools might have special advanced classes in the arts or technology, and a student with interests and aptitude can get their extra classes at the special school.Technology is not that important in the classroom unless that is a special class on technology.Religion does not make a school “better” — especially when religion is used to denigrate or deny Science. Schools must teach civic culture: in a democracy, that means understanding why we have certain norms and accepted institutions. It also means accepting that we have a multicultural country with a variety of religions and no religion, a variety of ethnicities and colors, and a variety of traditions. Most of all, a democracy demands participation by a well-informed, critical and active population.Dividing children by race or religion defeats education.",84,4,2.7k,"2,323",0,0
2,What do Republicans mean when they refer to 'school choice'? Do Democrats disagree with it and why?,Democratic Party vs. Republican Party,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"“School choice” boils down to anti-public school.Ostensibly they think that people should be able to choose to go to a school if they want to, and because of that there should be a gradient of quality — if you can afford better, then you get better. If you can’t, then you shouldn’t.At the root of the problem is that conservatives generally don’t think governments should run schools. They also hate public unions like the teacher’s union. There’s a ton of wiggle room in between defining their issues supporting “school choice,” of course, but it boils down to less control given by the government.Now, the less libertarian version of this is that they think that their kids shouldn’t be in with the rest of the rabble, and some kids are entitled to a better education.Private schools filled this niche for a long time. You pay a ton of money and you’re expected to get a good education from it. Private schools can be selective and disallow people from attending or they can just price you out. Many private schools do have scholarship programs to enable high achieving low income families to join. Democrats don’t have a problem with them, so long as they do as they promise — provide a good education…but at the same time, private schools aren’t really what the Republicans are talking about when they talk about “School Choice.” Private schools are private and therefore have more leeway with hiring teachers in that they don’t have to deal with a massive district or state or national public union.Charter schools are the new hotness. They’ve been around since 1992, but are blowing up lately thanks to the GOP being in office and Betsy DeVos running the DoE…but to be clear, these are state initiatives. Charter schools are privately run schools that are publicly funded. Chartering legislation creates a framework for different companies to start Charter schools in their districts. Charter schools have a bit more freedom than public schools in that they are free to hire teachers outside of the union and their curriculum isn’t dictated by the local school district. Charter advocates like to claim they receive 2/3s the money public schools do per student, but those numbers are a little…rough and they don’t have to provide as many services. Unlike private schools, charters aren’t generally allowed to be selective, they have to take everyone until they fill up.[1]The main advantage is if you get a good group running them, the kids can get a great education. If you don’t…it’s a nightmare.A lot of the states allow charter schools to be run by for profit companies. In other words, they apparently get less money, take a cut off the top and then try to provide for the kids, some states don’t (New York doesn’t, Michigan does).There’s also cyber schools, online charter schools. These aren’t great.So…Charter schools can be successful, but they’re very hit or miss.One problem I have with it is that it takes away money from public schools, which are often pretty underfunded to begin with.The general reason that Republicans like them is that the schools can make up their own curriculum and can blur the line between public, private, secular and religious.[2] [3]While low income kids can flourish in Charter schools…many charter schools and state regulations don’t really catch bad charter schools and are clearly out to make a buck (which you can still do with a non-profit).Another School Choice push is School voucher systems where you can get a voucher to subsidize your private school education, which again, comes from public school funds. The issue here is that it undercuts the market. It helps middle class people make ends meet, but isn’t enough money to let low income kids attend without scholarships — which are selective.Democrats would prefer to fix the public school system by fixing issues with the public school system rather than making two different systems taking up the same funds. Public schools can be good, they don’t have to suffer. Additionally, educating kids, and providing proper welfare and employment to support the community, the entire community could improve.The general idea here is that Republicans want to do several things with school choice:Control the curriculumMake a buck off of a libertarian agendaEnact de facto segregation. (Although, ironically, this is a bigger problem in cities, kind of a NIMBY problem).I, personally, as a liberal, think that simple exposure to as much diversity as possible, is a positive thing. I feel like highly achieving kids will find a way. I did well even in a borderline school where whites only maintained a plurality between primarily Southeast Asians and Hispanic/Latino, and like John Oliver said, funding follows White People.Footnotes[1] Just What IS A Charter School, Anyway?[2] Separating fact from fiction in 21 claims about charter schools[3] How Charters Sneak Religion Into Public Schools",98,2,5.9k,"8,987",0,4
2,What do Republicans mean when they refer to 'school choice'? Do Democrats disagree with it and why?,Democratic Party vs. Republican Party,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"I’ve written about this extensively in the past, so I’ll give you the quick version here.“School choice” just means allowing parents to direct the money the government is going to spend educating their child towards the school the parents want to educate their child, even if that’s a private school.Parents, like everyone else within a school district, pay taxes that fund the local public schools. School choice advocates say that those parents should be able to put their child in a private school, and the public school district should send at least a portion of the money they would have spent on that child’s education to the private school that’s actually doing the job.Where I live, in Chicago, private schools get better results for less expense than public schools. It’s a no-brainer for parents: get your kid in a private school if you can. But most parents can’t, because they can’t afford the tuition, even though it’s cheaper than what public schools spend per student.So people are making the argument that, like many other things the government does that cost too much and get crappy results, we should out-source education if parents want to do that.Yes, most Democrats are against it. The usual reasons are:Private schools can reject students, so it’s not fair. From the point of view of the capable-but-poor students, they’re being forced to stay in failing schools to prop up the test scores and keep those schools from being completely full of students who’ve been rejected from private schools.Taxpayer money might be used for religious education. Actually, many Democrats don’t really give a damn about this. It’s just a good talking point for them. But this is easily overcome with tax credit for private education. That way the government isn’t writing a check to a parochial school… the government just isn’t taking that money from the parents in the first place.Private schools aren’t usually unionized, and it would cripple public school unions if the best students leave the public schools en masse. The schools do not exist for the benefit of the unions. If a change in school funding helps students but hurts unions… oh well.There isn’t a private school option everywhere. This is true. Fortunately, schools are mostly funded at the local level, so the funding schemes can be changed only in places that have private school options. It would be easy to do in Chicago… there are literally hundreds of schools to choose from.

2,What do Republicans mean when they refer to 'school choice'? Do Democrats disagree with it and why?,Democratic Party vs. Republican Party,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"School choice means using taxpayer money to pay for private or charter schools.The problem with the idea is that private and charter schools are generally unregulated and get to select the students they enroll.There is nothing wrong with parents choosing to pay for their child to go to a private school. However, once public money is involved, there should be the same regulations and accountability as public schools have. Parents will choose these schools because they sound better but tests often show that they don’t improve learning any better or worse than public schools do.They way private and charter make themselves look better than public schools is by not enrolling students who have difficult home lives or who have disabilities. All of those students stay in public schools. The students who get enrolled in private or charter schools don’t learn any more than they would have in public school but now they are segregated and don’t interact with students who have different backgrounds or challenges than them.Another problem is that many people, like DeVos, are using this movement to make money from. They are trying to use public money to make their private corporations money. It is the same problem we are having with private prisons in this country. It is crony capitalism at its most corrupt.Democrats generally disagree with it because it hasn’t shown to help education. It is diverting public money into private corporations pockets.

2,What do Republicans mean when they refer to 'school choice'? Do Democrats disagree with it and why?,Democratic Party vs. Republican Party,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Republicans see it as a way to make the dollars follow the student. If, say, the state is spending on average $10K per year on each public school student, the family gets that $10K and decides to which school they will send their kid. This means that schools that are failing will see their students move out to schools that are doing better.Democrats see it as a way to divert money from public schools into private, parochial, or charter schools. The end result is likely to be public schools that are stuck with an ever higher proportion of students who can’t leave: either because their parents don’t have to means to take them elsewhere, or because they are disabled and won’t be accepted by the other schools. One more thing should be added: it takes more money to educate a poor child, on average, than a rich kid.

To let him make his own decisions about his own life. To let him seek liberty as he wishes to seek liberty. To let him be able to define what his own happiness is.

They have organizations, communities and sports.Now if there is any resistance to allowing a transwoman into a women’s sport, that resistance is seen as transphobic.

Dems are suppose to support the common man, yet people like Hillary are backing corporations that seek to make the common man’s life much harder.Not all are bad, just some on both sides.The party you’re voting against is not what you should be focusing on, it is the person. I was for Bernie at the time, but heavily against Hillary. When Obama was gonna be re-elected, Ron Paul was running and I supported him while the media acted like he didn’t even exist.I’m on the Left, but I’ve only supported the good ones that WOULD be a benefit for everyone, I was never focused on the party, I was focused on the person, something that voters on both sides don’t do.Do we need absolute equality? No, we don’t. We just need Human Rights to be generalized to every single kind of person whether straight, gay, lesbian, whatever, male female, black, white, asian, muslim, christian, atheist, whatever. We honestly don’t need these rights that are exclusive to whoever & whatever.Should we focus on War? No, we shouldn’t. As we are now, we are the strongest military force on the planet, hell barely a quarter of our infantry is enough to beat N. Korea if we needed to. We have bases in almost every country, and we have been at war with too many things for too long.Illegals issue? It will NEVER get fixed peacefully and lawfully. We could build a wall taller than the Great Wall of China and we’d still have illegals coming in. We don’t have enough people watching the borders, we don’t immediately boot them (we hold them, and we’d still have to spend resources on them), and we’re not exactly doing a great job telling them “STAY OUT”. There’s a few ways it could be resolved but none are being done:Build Military bases on the border with soldiers guarding it, instead of sending soldiers to war we could send them to the border, we could demand that Mexico ensure their citizens don’t illegally get here, and if all the others fail, shoot them on sight - I know its wrong, but fear is a powerful deterrent and if we don’t give them a good enough reason, they’ll just keep coming. Overall, the Wall won’t do a damn thing.Women as Presidents? As long as that woman is not Anita Sarkesian, Kim Kardashian, Hillary Clinton, Sarah Palin, or Ann Coulter, I’m all for women being president.

Definitely for it as America was NEVER founded on or by the Christian beliefs. Don’t believe me? Read the Constitution & look for quotes by the Founding Fathers.Are all Muslims and Arabs the Enemy? No, just some. Just like there are bad Muslims, there are and have been bad Christians as well as Catholics. The KKK are Christian. Hitler was a Christ Believer. And of course lets not forget the Westboro Baptist Church.What about Racism? Completely against Racism of all kinds, and I do not support the moronic view that if you’re in the minority, you can’t be racist. Everyone is 100% capable of being racist. I don’t believe in whatever color privilege, I do believe there is privilege but its not color-based or majority based. And I do not feel guilty for whites abolishing slavery when a black man fought against the abolishment of slavery (yeah, really happened).If there’s one thing I’d love to say to both parties it would be this:STOP VOTING FOR CORRUPT AND DUMB CANDIDATES WHILE IGNORING THE ONES THAT KNOW WTF THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT.Bernie is racist? Explain why he fought for black rights then. Ron Paul is just like Bush? No, he is a 1000x more intellectual than that moron and has been right about everything. Hillary is a good choice? She wants to start a war with Russia & Syria over ISIS (the very group trying to remove Asaad), she wants to ban books, she’s a complete sellout, a traitor, a “Blame it all on men” type of Feminist, and her family has been extorting Haiti for decades.

2,"If Democrats win the house, will they pass gun control laws?",Gun Control Laws,Gun Control in the United States of America,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Some will certainly try. Representatives of very anti-gun districts will, as they have already, introduce legislation such as Feinstein’s perennial “Assault Weapons Ban of Whatever Year This Is”. The opposition party in the House has very little power on the floor; debate is limited, the majority party controls nearly everything to do with the legislative process of getting bills passed, and the quorum requirement is a simple majority, so the majority party can continue doing business in the absence of every single opposition party member elected to the chamber.That’s the House. The Senate, on the other side of Capitol Hill, gives the opposition more power, most of the time. Filibusters are the opposition’s main weapon, and with sizable opposition caucuses to a bill or resolution, even the threat of a filibuster is a fearsome one. If the Senator Minority Leader, currently Chuck Schumer, signals his intent to filibuster a bill, the majority leader (Mitch McConnell) will usually simply withdraw it from consideration. This has been the order of the day for the minority leader for over a decade now; oppose everything not absolutely critical to the function of the government, and make the majority come up with 60 votes necessary to invoke cloture and bring the measure to a floor vote where a simple majority will pass it.The majority’s main counter, other than having those 60 votes, is a procedure called reconciliation. Reconciliation is an expedited process for pushing certain critical business through the Senate by simple majority; unlike cloture, which “calls the question” on other measures and which requires a hard 60 votes in favor, reconciliation allows just 51 Senators (or 50 and the VP) in favor of bringing a measure to the floor to do so over the objection of any minority. The bill must meet certain criteria to be eligible for reconciliation. Only three topics (spending, revenue and debt limit) can be addressed by said bill, and only one bill per topic, per year can be passed by reconciliation. This is a major reason Congress is seen as only getting one bite at the apple on major legislation each session; the Senate is limited by rule on how many times it may even hear the legislation over the objection of 40 Senators.In the 2018 midterms, of the 33 seats up for re-election, only eight are held by Republicans (Class 1 of the Senate was last elected in 2012, with Obama’s defeat of Romney to win a second term giving a significant boost “downballot”). With 51 Republicans in the Senate and a Republican VP, even if the Democrats “run the table”, they’ll only have 57 Senators, short of the threshold to prevent a filibuster on a party-line vote. It would, however, set the stage for a monumental re-election fight in 2020, when 22 Republican-held seats will be up for re-election. Most of those are in very deeply red states, and some Democrats up for re-election are very vulnerable. Doug Jones, who won the special election in Alabama last year by a whisker, will have to do it again in 2020 downballot of Trump in a state Trump won by nearly 2:1 over Clinton. However, on the other side, four Republican seats are considered vulnerable, which is theoretically enough if the Democrats show very strongly in both elections.

And the answer, as it turns out, is in the framing of the answerer.And then another complicating factor is when one draws in comparisons to the private sector. There is a certain segment of people who act as if private sector spending is one-hundred percent efficient.Except that we know that is far from the case. One look at American landfills ought to convince anyone of that. One drive around town on New Year’s morning ought to convince anyone of that.We do not really have a standard of efficient spending, mostly by virtue of the difficulty of defining one.If we look at the most profitable firms, we find over and over and over again that firms grow not by reducing costs, but by increasing revenues faster than costs.So for a private firm, there is always the profitability measure—so long as profits continue to increase, the spending is difficult to question.Of course, if profits start going south, that is a different story.In that respect, it resembles the management of the Major League Baseball team. When your team is winning, it’s fun and cute. When they are not, it’s distracting and destructive.So really, when one comes down to it, the question appears to have a laudable goal—perhaps we can get that “crazy government spending” under control, and to do that, we need to know just how crazy it is.But keep in mind we are dealing with human beings—you know, the people who invented crazy.So really, I do not know what to tell you other than to be like everyone else and make up your own bullshit measure.",150,3,543,"1,680",0,1
1,How inefficient is US government spending really?,Government Spending,U.S. Federal Budget,Fiscal Policy,1!,1!,1!,"It depends on the agency, and the degree of contracting out tasks the agency on its own can’t accomplish.Social Security, for example is quite efficient, operating with an overhead estimated to be about 2%. It has no “CEO making $75Million-per-year,” but rather a cabinet-level administrator making considerably less that $500,000 per-year. Likewise, it has no expensive board of directors, expensive CFO, vice-presidents, and so on.The IRS is another example of a government agency that operates with a minimal overhead. Ditto for most other government agencies.Then you get into those agencies that employ a ton of private contractors, like Defense. This is where you get fighter jets that always exceed budget and start life with numerous deficiencies that require expensive re-engineering, duplication of efforts, $800 toilet seats, $90 hammers, and the list goes on. These are the agencies that the parasites of the American economy grow fat on, defense contractors. This, btw, is one of the few ways that a Congressman can “bring jobs back home,” so it’s no small wonder that the Defense budget is grossly bloated. A lot of defense spending is a way to reward voters in a particular district for their votes, not a true “necessity for national defense.”It’s my considered opinion that government by itself usually, actually runs pretty efficiently. It’s when you open up the government to capitalism and contractors that costs get totally out of hand.A good example of this going forward is likely to be the wall that President Trump wants to build. It will, of course, be built by contractors. Estimated at $25 Billion, its cost will likely balloon to closer to $100 Billion, if past performance is any indication, and when it’s all said and done, the border patrol won’t save one nickel on patrolling the border, while the total number of illegal immigrants would likely fall, they’ll continue to flood the border using ladders, tunnels, and simply walking to those areas without a wall, and I predict that not one nickels worth of illegal drugs crossing the border will be reduced since those smugglers will simply build more tunnels, use drones to go over the wall, and submarines and planes to go around it. The President will, of course, declare victory, contractors will make a ton of money, and in the end, sustainably little will be accomplished. All of which assumes that Congress actually funds the wall, which seems diminishingly less and less likely. Why? Because business profit enormously from the cheap labor crossing the border, and the Republican party always follows the money that business interests contribute to them. In other words, a Republican Congress is unlikely to kill the goose that lays golden eggs.",1k,10,433,"3,596",0,0
1,How inefficient is US government spending really?,Government Spending,U.S. Federal Budget,Fiscal Policy,1!,1!,1!,"EXTREMELY Inefficient.The US military is an excellent example.The US military budget is just shy of $600 Billion annually.An estimated 20% of that (over $100 Billion) is wasteful or unnecessary spending and does not benefit the US except to create jobs and give people paychecks. But as a nation, it doesn’t really accomplish anything.The US military has already done its own budget calculations and found that it could cut at least $60 Billion with no loss to ability, just getting rid of wasteful spending.But if it does that, then it gives congress an excuse to cut even more than that from the budget, so instead nothing gets cut.Some corporate type was hired to do a budget check a few years ago and found $115 Billion in excess that could be cut- His report was buried.Now to be fair- you cannot run the military like a corporation. So $115 Billion is probably too much to cut and still remain at its current level of effectiveness.But the $60 Billion number the military provided is probably not enough.Unfortunately, if the US Military wants something funded, it goes to ask for more money rather than reapportioning what it already has.Rather than divert $5 Billion from wasteful spending, instead it will push congress for a $10 Billion funding increase.The Nimitz class super carriers which are already costing over $12 Billion a piece are an excellent example.Despite the fact that many military individuals believe these craft to be gigantic floating targets, despite the fact that a working model has yet to be built, despite the fact that even basic functions such as arresting gear are not even functional, when the budget cap for them was reached, more was requested from congress. For some strange reason I have yet to figure out, DJT has even promised to increase the number of these behemoth cash burners by a few, even though most everyone paying attention thinks that money and resources would be much more intelligently spent on crafts like battleships/subs/etc.So those things as a whole are basically a perfect example of inefficient Gov Spending to the tune of over ten billions dollars USD per craft.M-1 Abrams and F-35’s are another great example of inefficient Gov spending.I would also recommend researching “Iron Triangles” in the US for more examples.",712,1,220,"2,411",0,0

Democrats are a minority in both houses of Congress and cannot hold anything at all hostage. The people who are preventing the Trump Administration from passing an immigration bill suitable to the Trump Administration are Republicans.The situation is that the Republicans are not agreed among themselves regarding how to “reform” immigration, and so there has been no bill proposed that can pass the House with only the votes of Republicans. Essentially no Democrats are willing to vote for the bills proposed by various Republican sponsors, in part because none contain resolutions to the status of undocumented immigrants acceptable to Democrats, but more because essentially all of these bills contain other provisions (such as terminating the Diversity Lottery, cutting the total number of immigrants, or imposing onerous restrictions on legal immigrants) that are also unacceptable to Democrats generally (in other words, they are not reasonable reforms by Democratic standards), and also because the Democrats have agreed among themselves to stand strong on these issues and not vote for any Republican-sponsored immigration bill without the agreement of the caucus on that bill.The Republicans, unable to obtain unity within their own caucus, are unwilling to take the blame for their inability to effectively govern with a majority, and are seeking to blame the Democrats for being unwilling to compromise their principles and support a Republican bill that would be, by Democratic standards, worse than the current law.

This was thought to be a good deterrent to asylum-seekers, and would allow border-crossers to be sent back more quickly.It appears not to have slowed the flow of desperate asylum seekers, but is producing a massive cock-up at the border, with tent camps being set up to handle all the separated parents and children. The ACLU has filed a lawsuit that the implementation of these laws violate due process, but the legal system moves slowly.This is a clear and vicious bastardization of laws that were originally written to protect children.Why Are families Being Separated at the Border?

It is important to note that there is NO federal law that directs the separation of children from their families, no matter how they entered the United States. This stems directly from a press statement (not a law) directed by Attorney General Jeff Sessions in response to Trump’s requests for stricter enforcement. (Sessions stated, “If you are smuggling a child, then we will prosecute you and that child will be separated from you as required by law … If you don’t like that, then don’t smuggle children over our border.”)It should be noted that, for quite a long period of time, it has been a misdemeanor federal offense to be caught illegally entering the United States, punishable by up to six months in prison, but the administration has not always referred everyone caught for prosecution. Those apprehended were swiftly put into immigration proceedings and, unless they met the threshold to pursue a valid asylum claim, can be quickly deported from the country and that even the IIRIRA provided exceptions to this enforcement legislation, for example, if there was a pending asylum application and for battered women and children.So, to answer the question of “What law (supposedly) did the Democrats pass allowing illegal aliens children to be taken from them?

1,Did Democrats hate Roseanne before she endorsed Trump?,Democratic Party (US politics),Hate,Trump-Pence 2016,1!,1!,1!,"TL;DR: I’m a liberal who likes Roseanne, always have.For those who want to take the time to read:I am a consummate liberal who didn’t watch Roseanne’s show much the first time around, a few episodes here and there. I liked it but it didn’t stand out as a show I would commit to watching.The 10th season however grabbed my interest in a way the previous iteration did not. I don’t know why except I’m 20 years older and an adult who also struggles with money periodically, am a business owner, and have a husband who works a factory job (in maintenance - high tech skills, but still a union job at a steel mill). Maybe I relate better in my daily life, even though we are west coast liberals and have many, many, many issues with Trump being President.But I LOVE Roseanne the show. Watching her show this time around felt honest and like it captured the essence of family. It shows people being imperfect, struggling, and loving each other while they struggle. The very point of the show is that disagreement is okay, we’re still family. That’s what she was saying with the first episode of the new season. It landed for me in the way she intended. On the press tour she said different politics shouldn’t ever divide family or friends and it helped me accept and make room in my heart for Trump supporters. On reflection, maybe I loved this iteration of the show so much because I needed to make peace with Trump supporters in my country, and find a way to have genuine empathy and love for them. In that regard, her show was a balm for what has been a very painful post-election experience for me.Then she wrote a stupid, horrible, racist tweet, and I remembered how problematic Roseanne the person is. She struggles with mental illness by her own admission (in 2011 she told Oprah “I was prescribed numerous psychiatric drugs ... to deal with the fact that I had some mental illness ... I totally lost touch with reality”), and I think this helps explain many of the stories I heard about her, like how she created an extremely toxic work environment during the first run of the show.The answer is I do not and have never hated Roseanne. I mildly liked her show in the past, and really liked it today. I was heartbroken it was cancelled and hope they find a way to continue without her.Racism is actually a symptom of mental illness, and it was a sign of an episode with the two people I did care giving for who had schizophrenia. If either said something racist we were supposed to document it - not because they were in trouble, but because it meant they might need adjustments to their meds. These people were not racist on a daily basis, just when they were having an episode and more prone to hearing voices and/or engaging in unsafe behavior.I don’t know Roseanne’s diagnosis, but I completely believe she was having an episode and is not a consummate racist. There was plenty of evidence on the show of her having a blind spot around race issues, but that she consciously wanted her conservative fans to see that Muslims belong here just as much as anyone else (yes, I know, it was a problematic episode but the conscious intention was there), non-binary sexuality is a real and acceptable thing, and that people of different races can belong in the same family. Mostly, she wanted people who disagree with each other to get along with each other, and I loved and benefited from that message.I’m sorry this happened. My guess is mental illness was the cause of her tweet but I don’t know. I do know she would take it back a thousand times over if she could, and if our society did nuance or understood/had patience for mental illness maybe this whole thing would be viewed in a different context and Roseanne could keep her show without it sending the message that people can get away with being openly racist.",77,1,97,43,0,0
1,Did Democrats hate Roseanne before she endorsed Trump?,Democratic Party (US politics),Hate,Trump-Pence 2016,1!,1!,1!,"I never much liked the Roseanne Show, but that’s mainly a matter of taste.I had no real opinion of Roseanne Barr as a person until I heard about her getting angry at her Hawaiian neighbors for wantonly “stealing” macadamias from her farm. It is, apparently, the custom on the Big Island that it is permissible for passers-by to “glean” any macadamias that fall from trees that overhang the public walkway, even if the trees are privately owned. (This is a fairly common custom, similar to the command in Jewish law to “leave the corners of the field” for the poor.) Roseanne apparently took exception to people doing this, and in so doing she lost my respect: such customs exist for good cause, and in any case as an outsider who chose to move to Hawaii, it is her obligation to conform to the custom rather than rail against it.I admit that, until the recent craziness around Season Ten of the Roseanne Show, I had no idea what her politics were generally.

But by every practical measure, there is no substantial claim behind those words. Not one. Here are the facts…Bernie has consistently supported the Democratic party for 30 years.Bernie has held leadership positions in the Democratic party and in the Democratic caucus in both the House and in the Senate.Bernie has campaigned for, and alongside, other Democrats.Bernie has raised money for other Democrats.Bernie has sponsored legislation for the Democrats, and has consistently, with rare exception*, voted for Democratic policy.In every measure that can be made, Bernie operates as a Democrat. Anyone who claims he isn’t one cannot stand upon facts to the contrary.The DNC knows that Bernie is a powerful influence within the party and among Democratic and liberal voters. The party will not risk losing those voters over a rift with Bernie Sanders over his eligibility.Something else to consider is that Howard Dean, the former chair of the DNC and presidential contender, is not a registered Democrat and never has been. Patrick Leahy has also never been a registered Democrat, because in Vermont, no one can register as a member of a political party. That’s the sole reason why Bernie claims to be an independent in Vermont—because everyone is.So the only difference between Bernie and Howard Dean is four words: “I am a Democrat.” Those four words will not be used by the DNC to risk losing more than a million voters, which they would surely lose if they tried to keep Bernie out.* Many Democrats occasionally break ranks and vote against policy that other Democrats support.

1,"Do you think the DNC’s new rules about Presidential contenders are a mistake, leading to a potential schism with Bernie Sanders running as an independent in 2020?",Bernie Sanders 2016 Presidential Campaign,Bernie Sanders,1!,1!,1!,1!,"A2A — I’m trying to reconcile the first two paragraphs of the linked article:Democratic National Committee officials on Friday moved forward with a proposal to force the party’s presidential candidates to identify as Democrats, a move that drew immediate criticism from a top official in Bernie Sanders’ 2016 campaign.The prospective rule change, approved by the DNC’s Rules and Bylaws Committee, would not necessarily impact Sanders, the independent Vermont senator who ran for president as a Democrat.So, the DNC wants people who run for President on their tickets to “identify as Democrats.” Okay, makes sense — if I’m a Democrat, I don’t want a Nazi or a member of the Communist Party at the top of my ticket. But then we have the statement that this requirement “would not necessarily impact Sanders,” which makes no sense, because Sanders is not a Democrat.After the 2016 DNC convention, Sanders renounced the Democratic Party, which he had joined, to run for President, and went back to being an independent. From the Wall Street Journal:Asked after the event whether Mr. Sanders considers himself a Democrat or an independent, a campaign aide said, “He ran for president as a Democrat but was elected to a six-year term in the Senate as an independent.”And then, of course, there was this: Sanders: I don't consider myself a DemocratThat’s pretty awkward, amplified by this:November 2015: When a reporter asked Sanders his party allegiance after he filed, Sanders responded, “I’m a Democrat.” He then called on Buckley, the Democratic chairman, who confirmed the senator’s party allegiance. Sanders added that he would run as a Democrat in any future elections.October 2017: Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has confirmed that he will run for reelection in the Senate as an independent in 2018, despite recent pressure from some Democrats to join the party. Sanders told Fox News of his decision to hold on to his independent status during an interview Sunday night.So my take away, particularly if the bit about this rule change “not necessarily impact(ing) Sanders,” a guy who became a Democrat of convenience in 2016, and is apparently welcome to do so again in 2020, is that this is the logical outcome of a mindset that says you are whatever you happen to identify with. If I want to say that I’m a Chinese seven year old girl named Trudy, I could easily find Democrats who would be okay with that.And if I’m not a Democrat, but I identify as one during a Presidential campaign, I guess that’s okay, too.Will this lead to a schism with Bernie Sanders in 2020?

For instance a working class Democrat who cares about the environment but is also concerned about illegal immigration.This will likely cause a shift in voting away from Democrats over the short and medium term until they can rid themselves of a leadership that demands ideological purity as a litmus test for nomination.Pretty much doubling down on dumb and pushing even more voters towards Trump and alternative parties like Libertarian and Green.This is the exact basic electoral “algebra” that cost them the last election, and will continue to cost them electoral success until the stranglehold is broken.Bernie will be too old to run but that won't change the underlying dynamic unless and until the Democrats start prioritizing their voters over their party.Republicans will pick up seats this fall, it's too late to stop that, and Trump will win reelection in 2020 unless Democratic voters demand sweeping changes in party leadership.",179,3,283,473,0,0

2,What is something that needs to be said about feminism in the United States?,Feminism,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"I never thought I'd be writing half of what I am about to, but I've just realised I don't have to bend to others' will when discussing feminism. A very American sentiment, no? With that being said:A letter to the American feminists—Never compromise your ideas in the name of gaining allies to fight a bigger war. The enemy of your enemy isn't your friend, they just use you so that there's one less enemy less for them to fight once they turn their attention to you.Feminists of America: when there is a new idea about feminism that you haven't heard before, but is getting pushed as ""the next big thing"" in feminism: learn whether it matches with your values and respond accordingly. Guilting yourself into accepting rhetoric you dislike in the name of the cause is how oppression forms. You can oppose what you don't like about #MeToo while remaining a feminist. Your ideas are not wrong, merely unpopular.Women achieved feminist aims all throughout the world with nobody's permission. Men (and women) have hated feminism as long as it has existed and will continue to hate it perpetually. Don't take dissent too personally; haters are going to hate.Correcting the behaviour of businesses and corporations is a good strategy. It is easy to verify what they've done, and it usually results in an indisputably good outcome. Using public scenarios as a way to teach others can be a good strategy, but only if they care about their image. Lawsuits and court cases offer teachable moments to explain why they are happening- someone might think it is a non-issue that a boss fired an employee for not dating them, after all. Someone who doesn't want to be known in that way would probably change their act, but note what happened to Donald Trump, and how little he suffered when women accused him of sexual assault. Be wary of these situations.There's a war going on between choice-oriented feminism and goal-oriented feminism. Know where you stand and why.I mean that in the highest sense from earlier, about guilt and the need to resist it. There is a valid argument to be made that women within Islam who wear the Hijab have internalised willingly their oppression and have accepted the demeaning rhetoric spoken by certain men within Islam, and need to be forced to achieve true liberation.[1]After all, a woman in the 1960s criticising early feminists for not staying in the kitchen would be ridiculed today. She would have been repeating the talking points of the patriarchy, and if everyone agreed with her the US would have never seen women liberated from the home and their gender roles.Some feminists might think that she's actively hurting the cause, and because she is an obstacle to advancement, she is no better than the sexist society she supports… but in thinking this, you're negating her beliefs, blaming her against the ""ideal woman"" who acts nice and supports all the right policies… a gender role she isn't comforming to. Can feminism claim only some women deserve to voice their opinions? Is it nothing more than ""if you're not with us, you're against us""? Are all women equal, only some are more equal than others?That's where we get the idea that ""trans women/feminine women/married women can't be real feminists"". Traitors to their gender. And that is my issue with goal-oriented feminism.But if you believe this, follow your belief to the last letter even in the face of my disapproval. This is crucial for your perspective on feminism to live on and for feminism in general to survive being destroyed by those who wish it destroyed… even if they think you're the one destroying it.Then there's choice-oriented feminism. I think back to Ayn Rand's saying: you can't force people to be free. There is also a valid argument to be made that because wearing the Hijab is what she wants, it is moral. To force her to give up headcoverings would be to claim you know better than she does, which makes you no better than the oppressive society that claimed the exact same thing in the past.Yet this type of feminism is oddly similar to libertarianism- if a person and their boss consent to a $0,05/hour wage, that's clearly acceptable to this type of feminism, since it would be immoral to force them to be free. One person's oppression is the other's vision of the good life, of course… But we can all see it's a horrible contract. We (as feminists) want to believe it's right in theory, but we (as humans) object to it in practice. This is my biggest problem with choice-oriented feminism.So if you're in a discussion with someone, and they start talking about the dangers of the Burqa, know where their allegiance lies and how to approach, agree with and disagree with them.Feminism must move beyond the feel-good purpose that it has acquired in the United States. For an analogy, as a prospective historian who used to write about the subject on Quora, I've encountered plenty of people who see answers talking about the Byzantine Empire and comment ""but it was actually the Roman Empire!""As if they thought dear goodness, this knowledge changes my life! The Byzantine Empire was still the Roman Empire and I shall tell everyone about it so it can change theirs too, as if it were a life-altering fact.To which I say: The Byzantine Empire is now known as the Roman Empire… now what? We've just completed step one. You've corrected the myth. Now we have work to do, the hard work of changing historiography to recognise a Roman legitimacy that Gibbon left out. Rediscover the merits of an empire long considered the sad, pathetic remnant of its former self. Do everything that you need to in order to change the narrative. But merely calling it the Roman Empire is shorthand for all the tough work you aren't doing.It's the same with feminism, where the thing to say these days is that ""feminism is about gender equality"". To which I say, once again: so feminism is about gender equality… now what? You've corrected the myth. You've taken step one. Now comes your hard work: electing people into office, changing opinions, showing by your merits that it is about gender equality. Don't just debate anti feminists, debate other feminists.And above all, don't dare partner with the enemy of your enemy. Only when you follow your feminism can it truly be achieved.Footnotes[1] France's burqa ban upheld by human rights court",286,1,586,"1,203",0,1

Oh and rarely the laws protect poor victim girls who share sexual selfies with boys who pressure them so oops not so free and empowered huh? Oh wait it gets worse.

The Soviet Union never made it there. Union of Soviet SOCIALIST Republics. At the end of the day, there is no difference, IN OUTCOMES, between Socialism, Marxism and Communism.They fail because they crush the human spirit and ignore human nature. They require governments to fix prices, ignoring the profit incentive while removing all accountability and at the same time trampling private ownership of property.Socialism and Communism have proven throughout history to be a failed systems. They have evolved from early day Utopians to Marxist revolutionaries to modern day democratic socialist infiltrators.Let’s look at how they have evolved:Karl MarxSocialism requires 4 basic elements:No Private Property or InheritanceSteeply Graduated Income TaxCentral Control (healthcare, utilities, banking)Free Public EducationThen during the Cold war, Socialists realized that Capitalism was winning so Anthony Crosland (a Fabian socialists) wrote - ""The Future of Socialism.” The idea was to essentially and slowly infiltrate capitalism. What we now call “Crony Capitalism.So, they rebranded communism (Democratic Socialism as Lenin would referred to it in the late 19 Teens) — instead of communism, there was a new reformed Socialism.Socialism called for under Anthony Crosland and the Fabian Socialists.Progressive income taxFree public educationFree healthcareExpanded social securityIn this form of socialism, private property was required because it the collectivization wasn’t working in Russia; well, that and it scared people. Instead of the traditional communist revolution it was socialist infiltration.Now, let’s take a look at our good friend, the self proclaimed Democratic Socialist, Bernie Sanders. Let’s also ignore the fact that Lenin sold communism to the Russian people as Democratic Socialism, because that is just a mere coincidence.Here are the things that Bernie Sanders stand for:Redistribution of wealthProgressive income taxCentral Control (private property but with direction and regulatory control by feds)Free healthcareFree public educationExpanded social securityNow, you might be asking yourself, what are the Bold and Bold Italics in the lists above? Well, everything in the first list is in Bold. Anything from the first list that appears in the subsequent lists are in Bold. Those that show up for the first time the second list are in Bold Italics, as such those new items that appear in the third list are a Bold Italics.Aren’t there some odd similarities? Everything from the 1st and 2nd list is in the expanded Bernie Sanders list; yet people say he isn’t a “real socialist” despite the entire Democratic Party agreeing with these 6 pillars as central to their party platform.Now, some are going to argue — What about Sweden. What about it? It is surely the most developed welfare state in the world, right — Yes, it probably is. So let’s take a look at Sweden and its “State of the Union” for a moment.Sweden is about to collapse under it's own weightSweden’s population is only 8 million people, about the size of the city of ManhattanSweden has the highest tax rates in the world. US averages 25% for the middle incomes where Swedes average 60% ONLY for their income tax. They still have a payroll tax and value added tax on purchases.Swedes earn 20% less than we do in America and pay 50-100% more for goodsThe average Swedish home is 800 sqftIkea was started in Sweden, but in order to make it, the owner moved to SwitzerlandThe Swedes have free college tuition — BUT in order to qualify fir free tuition, you have to move away and separate yourself from your family. Grants and loans go instead to paying for living expenses. Swedes then graduate with some the highest student debt in the world and make less money than graduates in other countries.Man, if Socialism was explained in this way — how many people would say they still want it? Add the 100 million lives that were taken in the 20th century to achieve the Socialist Utopia only to fall into Communist Revolution — and man, we have the trifecta — what however many we stopped counting at.But that’s just my two cents for the conversation.Many parts of this answer have come from my own prior answers on Socialism: Bryce Ebeling's answer to Why do so many people in the USA today, mostly young people, say that they want socialism to replace our current form of government?",342,9,164,551,0,0

The only real question about Trump is whether is need for attention or his desire for enriching himself are paramount, though they do function perfectly in tandem. Ronald Reagan did love this country and did believe in its ideals, and that was one of the reasons he was popular. He was able to tap into the love of country that most Americans profess, though how that manifests itself is obviously complex and the source of conflict in our country.

At this point I imagine they’d find pretty much everything he says dubious…too remarkable, strange, and narcissistic to be true. Even so, many of them might feel a bit nervous…after all, they were already leaning towards the idea of using something like this “Electoral College” as a means to prevent the masses from foolishly electing an authoritarian populist…their conceptual Electors would be good citizens that would vote based on experience, wisdom, and conscience…not driven solely by the masses. But, here in front of them, sits an authoritarian populist claiming that he is President of their dream nation. After further drinks and questions, they’d perhaps find out that he has little respect for his predecessor, who he says showed weakness by being such a close ally to Britain, France, and Germany. This would shock them…how could such an alliance be possible and why would this buffoon see it as weak? Then they’d find out that the predecessor’s predecessor, who also won the Electoral College over the popular vote, drove the country into an expensive foreign war (perhaps Trump would brag that he’d never start a war off of fake information like that fellow did). Now, that’s enough, they say! How foolish! Disturbed, the founding fathers send this strangely orange man off on his way and talk it over. They don’t really believe him…but maybe, just maybe, they should put an explicit expiration date on this “Electoral College”…because it sounds like it might not work after a while.Strolling confidently down a dirt path with his characteristic big grin (perhaps he believes now that he is responsible for the very creation of the US because of his conversations), Trump comes across a contingent of British soldiers. He regales them with outlandish (even for our times) stories and brags about his businesses (neglecting to mention the failures, of course) and…things he’s grabbed.

That said, there were some people who weren’t all that different from him in many ways, behaviorally. Jefferson wasn’t a prodigious liar like Trump, but certainly engaged his lies effectively to suit him and gain favor. He was good at playing the press to his whims.So was Hamilton, and Hamilton was no doubt a womanizer. It was just something people tended to overlook back then…or not comment on as openly or avidly.Burr was pretty outlandish in taking liberties. He founded what became Chase Manhattan Bank on a lie, and he was fairly petty about many things. So one has to wonder just how badly Trump would be received.I think the main point, though, is that these men were largely well educated and good students. While Trump would have an advantage over them in the sense that he is ‘going back in time’ and would have an idea of future events, and knowledge of modern things, let’s assume he lost that memory, though his mind salvaged the basics of running a business and forming friendships and coalitions, as well as good negotiation. I think they’d be stunned that he doesn’t speak or read Latin or Greek (though it seems highly likely he has or had a command of Gaelic and German due to his grandparents and parents - not particularly useful languages in colonial America), and would find his inability to articulate a clear philosophical thought a bit odd and off-putting.Like many hypotheticals of this nature, it’s hard to really know what would happen, but I’d venture a guess that most would find him to be fairly unreliable and unusual. In their business dealings, you had to be sincere and uphold contracts. Respect and sincerity were held in high regard because that was everything to them - how else could you manage business?

1,Why do progressive challengers still lose primaries to establishment democrats?,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"There’s a bias in the question that assumes that the super progressive candidate is always best, and clearly so. I really don’t know where this idea came from, but it’s just not true.Ultra-leftists candidates have simply never had the success to justify the belief in their innate superiority. There’s never been a time when the ultra leftists candidates were winning tons of races. Bernie Sanders was the closest thing such a candidate had to broad popularity, and he lost the 2016 democratic primary by a fairly wide margin (and please, let’s not go through the motions of saying this was the fault of DNC shenanigans…the DNC does not have a weighty enough thumb to put on the scales to tip them by that amount).Seen in the light of history, the question isn’t why progressive candidates aren’t winning, it’s what has changed that would cause us to expect them to do so? The answer is that not much has changed.Look, I’m a leftist guy at heart, but I didn’t support Sanders in 2016. He lost my support with his completely naive rhetoric about what his positions would do for the economy (I’ve mercilessly mocked republicans for far less). I didn’t like the way he tried to colorblind either, pretending that if we just fix the economy then other injustices will right themselves. As the campaign wore on, I loathed his inability to play on the same team as other democrats. His campaign and supporters cried foul over the most innocuous of situations (many still do) and they helped in the character assassination that ultimately stopped Hillary Clinton from being president.Now, was Hillary Clinton perfect? No, but she had lots of good ideas for incrementally bettering the country and she didn’t have anything resembling the economic illusions of the Bernie camp (“just do x, y, and z, and the median income will go up by $21k”). She had sensible positions on issues of discrimination. Finally, her campaign was not about recriminations of other democrats. Her reaction to defeat was more of less usual for defeated candidates.You may disagree, even vehemently, with my assertions above. I’m not trying to convince anyone, I’m just explaining my thought process for the way I voted. The real answer to this question is that that progressive and far-left candidates have simply never been able to successfully make the case to most voters that they should be elected. For the most part, a majority of democrats tend to feel about progressive candidates like I did in the 2016 democratic primary: “hey, this person with the new approach is intriguing, but they don’t seem like they’ve thought through every detail yet and there’s a couple other things that I find disconcerting about them.” And yes, sometimes people doubt that progressive candidates will do as well in the general election.Progressive and leftist candidates need to get elected and get some great legislation passed if they want to be taken seriously as a force.

1,Why do progressive challengers still lose primaries to establishment democrats?,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Think about how you vote. Do you personally research every single candidate for every single race? If you’re like me, you don’t have the time or attention span to do that that. So you consider endorsements for the downballot races:NewspapersIssue groups: Emily’s List, VoteVets, Planned Parenthood affiliates, Sierra Club, Human Rights Campaign, etc.Individual big-name politicians, like Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama (or retiring / term-limited prior office holders, in the case of many primary contests)The loudest, easiest-to-find endorsements come from moneyed, influential players like the specific examples above. By definition, the establishment. The establishment considers candidate networking, predictability, “electability,” superficial optics, and of course, patronage. It’s risk-averse. The establishment is inherently more conservative and less democratic in its outlook than what self-identified progressives often prefer. And this is how you end up with Emily’s List endorsing anti-choice candidates running against pro-choice candidates in primaries, or Human Rights Campaign supporting candidates who oppose same-sex marriage.To elect more progressives, the electorate needs to listen to quieter, smaller, non-establishment voices for downballot endorsements, and make more risky judgement calls on who to trust in this regard. Obviously, that takes a bit more effort than listening to the big-name endorsers, whose names you see when reading Ballotpedia while standing in line to vote (and I admit to doing that). Even the best of us sometimes work down the ballot to a local judgeship with five candidates and only know the one name endorsed by a major issue group.

Such conditions would mean Trump’s second term would be in line with the second term of previous Presidents. Democrats could retake the White House by presenting a charismatic leader like Bill Clinton, but as Al Gore found out in 2000 you can’t just ride on the coat-tails of a popular President and get your own Presidency.Keep in mind as well, that the economy, foreign affairs and various crises affect support for a party in the White House as well.Also, historically the party in the White House is often not the party which controls Congress.

It was Bill Clinton himself who informed us that the “era of big government is over,” agreed with the Gingrich Congress on dramatic reductions in welfare spending and put an end to Glass-Stegal.Turns out that all the New Deal and Great Society programs put in place to soften the brutal edges of laissez faire capitalism so that the populace wouldn’t revolt and join either a fascist or communist movement actually had been helping.

2,"Do you support turning Fathers day to""special persons day"" since a lot of peoples fathers are not around?",Libertarianism (politics),Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"Mothers day was not originally a peace movement as mentioned in one answer. There have been such celebrations going back to Greek and Roman times, celebrating mother gods. The origin of Mother’s day in the UK and other European countries was the fourth Sunday in Lent and was a return to your mother church if you were working away from that area. It was a religious event but also permitted apprentices and women in service to return home to their mother’s as they were released by their ‘masters’ to return for Mothering Sunday. Over time it became associated with maternal mother rather than the mother church.Mothers day in the US seems to have been started by Anne Jarvis in the 1860s to reconcile Union and Confederate soldiers and in 1873 campaigned for it to become a Mother’s Peace Day. When adopted she then campaigned against it due to its change in nature and commercialisation.The UK Mothering Sunday service predates the American practice by over three hundred years. The American commercial mothering Sunday was merged in practice with the Church of England’s mothering Sunday subsequent to the second world war. The religious service does, however, continue to this day. The UK retains the fourth Sunday in Lent as the date of celebrating mother’s day rather than the US date which has now moved to the second Sunday in May.Given that mother’s day is just as commercial as father’s day there seems to be no purpose in having either event other than to promote the sale of cards, chocolates and boost phone company revenues. My father would, however, have been disappointed not to get his usual quota of rude cards and alcohol that he gets on father’s day. As such both days provide an opportunity to show your love and/or respect for your parents or persons that have adopted these roles.I am not sure why missing fathers is a reason to get rid of father’s day. I no longer have a mother, so mother’s day has ended for me. I do not see that as a reason to abandon the celebration for others. If a parent is missing/dead the day would not be celebrated. I guess (as I am not knowledgeable in this area) in families with same sex parents would either have a double celebration for mother’s day or father’s day as appropriate unless the family adopted father/mother roles or perhaps just ignored the event. Whichever way around it does not seem any reason to abandon the celebration. But, you can call it anything you like really given that both mother’s and father’s days are now fairly artificial constructs.",151,3,17,65,0,0

As in the Bible, ""no man (or woman) could buy or sell without the approval of a Republican. My African American, Baptist godmother was friends with the Irish Catholic neighbor lady around the corner. We ate at her home every Friday -- her fish was delicious, and she liked my godmother's cornbread.

She said he would treat the ""colored people"" fairly, because as a Catholic, he understood what it felt like to be an ""outsider."" My godmother was ""all ears."" To make a long story short, when it came time to vote in that Presidential election, my godmother (who worked as a charwoman in the House of Representatives chambers at our PA state capitol), declined the $2.00 and the offer of ""help to vote"" (she was quite literate, anyway), and voted for JFK. This was not without ""financial fallout"" for a 70 something year old woman raising this little black child. She lost her job at the Capitol. But she also had a job as a domestic for a doctor, who was also an Irish Catholic. When he learned that she lost her job, not only did he take her on to work fulltime, he also increased her salary.

He was also the doctor who had me admitted to the ""white"" children's hospital when I suffered a third degree burn, and our black doctor did not have admitting privileges at the Kline Hospital.

But in the Jim Crow South, few of them were able to vote without risking their lives. The Klan had a way of taking care of blacks who were so uppity that they’d exercise their right to vote.John F. Kennedy tried to enact a civil rights bill but died before he could. Lyndon Johnson pushed it through Congress by framing it as a memorial to his martyred predecessor. In response, blacks began registering to vote, mostly as Democrats.To your specific question: Japanese-Americans know that Franklin Roosevelt is long dead, so they don’t blame today’s Democratic Party for what FDR did. But if they were going to assign blame, the Republicans wouldn't get off scot-free: Earl Warren, then the Republican governor of California, pushed for internment.And the reparations paid under Reagan were so piddling as to be an insult: $20,000 to everyone still alive who was interned. Of course thousands of Japanese-Americans had died in the decades after 1945. And many of them held California real estate worth millions today because they were forced to sell it quickly, before they were sent to the camps. Their descendants lost fortunes that way.The first Japanese to come to the United States were recruited to work farm fields in Hawaii. Though not interned during World War II, they were systematically discriminated against and shut out of political power by Hawaii’s white elite.Their response was to volunteer for the 442nd Infantry Regiment in World War II, the most decorated unit in the history of American warfare. When they returned home, they became Democrats because the Republican Party still didn’t welcome them. Unabashedly running on their war records, they swept to power in Hawaii, which has been a blue territory and state ever since.Their success, and the high profile of nisei politicians like Daniel K.

5,What can Democrats learn from Hollywood about reaching out to voters?,Voting,Democratic Party (US politics),Hollywood,1!,1!,1!,"The problem for Democrats is that their inability to connect with a large segment of America is not messaging but policy.Hollywood elites are having the same problem as their Democratic Party acolytes. Late night comedians and Hollywood actors bashing the usual “basket of deplorables” are losing audience share across America as people who disagree with their brand of politics seek their entertainment elsewhere.Late night comedy ratings are at historic lows. A list actors are bombing at the box office. It’s seems that these high profile progressives are also ineffective at messaging as well.Exactly how eloquent and persuasive was Robert DeNiro’s multiple “F*ck Trump” rant at the recent awards show? He was preaching to the choir of leftist progressives but it’s highly doubtful he changed a single heart or mind among anyone not already on that team. Audiences are turning away.Yet the boycott threat looms all the same. It might extend to stars that aren’t as outrageous as Griffin, Depp or Reiner. Zach Galifianakis starred in two back-to-back bombs last September, shortly after his withering comments against candidate Trump.Scarlett Johansson, a gorgeous, talented star with a strong box office resume, suffered two of her own box office debacles in recent weeks. She’s taken on a much more public platform as a liberal activist of late, appearing in that infamous “Save the Day” campaign video last year on candidate Hillary Clinton’s behalf. She’s also been vocal in her support for Planned Parenthood.Yet the stars may not care if their activism costs them at the box office. During Jack Black’s promotional push for his 2015 comedy Goosebumps this reporter asked the actor that very question. When asked if his political outreach could negatively impact his career, he laughed and said no.Politically-charged stars, particularly fire breathers like Depp, may damage something more precious than some extra zeroes on their paychecks: their ability to change hearts and minds.Hollywood's hatred of Trump will keep biting Democrats at the pollsThe problem for Democrats is the same problem that Hillary Clinton had and almost every Democrat has had since Obama’s re-election. They’ve focused on messaging instead of developing a plan that appeals to a majority of Americans.If Democrats want to regain the power they’ve lost at the state and federal level in recent years, they will have to convince more voters they can offer solutions to their problems.That may be especially difficult, however, if voters think the party and its representatives in government don’t understand or care about them. And according to a recently released poll, many voters may, in fact, feel that way. The Washington Post-ABC News survey, released this week, found that a majority of the public thinks the Democratic Party is out of touch with the concerns of average Americans in the United States. More Americans think Democrats are out of touch than believe the same of the Republican Party or President Trump.A single poll shouldn’t be given too much weight on its own, but the results arrive at a time when Democrats are trying to understand what went wrong last year, and what they need to do to win over voters. The results raise questions over why exactly the public thinks the party is so out of touch.“This should be a huge wake-up call,” said Tim Ryan, the Ohio congressman who made an unsuccessful bid post-election for House minority leader. “Having two-thirds of the country think that your party is in la-la-land, that’s a bombshell. That should wake everybody up,” the Rust Belt Democrat who represents a state that Trump won and has argued the Democratic Party needs to improve its brand said, “and we should, as a party, be woken up already by the fact that people took a chance on Donald Trump.”There is nuance to the results of the survey. A closer look at the numbers shows that while a majority of Americans believe the Democratic Party is out of touch, most Democrats do not, though that’s only by a slim majority. Democratic voters do, however, seem to have less confidence in their party—at least at the moment—than Republicans do in theirs. A higher percentage of Republican voters, at 60 percent, said that the GOP is in touch with the concerns of most people, compared with just 52 percent of Democrats who said the same of their party.Why Do So Many Americans Think Democrats Are Out of Touch?",4.8k,306,7.2k,"2,166",0,7

State and federal inheritance taxes began after 1900, if you neatly ignore the temporary federal taxes done during the Civil War. California certainly is the haven for high-tech and a lot of federal tax money. Many red states fight federal taxes, look at Red Texas, but when millions and millions roll in for hurricane recovery, you don’t hear California complaining about the federal taxes coming from them.How do you get elected a dotard of a Russian puppet?

Trump sends in say 5 people, this new state gets 3 electoral college votes, one for the default minimum for its House member, 2 for the standard Congressman. These 5 people yield a lot of power through these 3 votes, it takes a lot more voters from say California to offset those 3 votes, as additional votes come only from more House members, which takes thousands of voters to get.Worst states, because of the old State rights concession, are allowed to dictate how these votes go, some states have a winning take all clauses. Worst the people who are appointed to cast these votes can go against the voters, the state, I believe the fine for that is only $1,000. Think about it, even if the fine where a $10K, what is that to someone who say is a billionaire and gets the job of casing the electoral vote.

The Democratic party leadership believed that the voters on the far left (at that time considered stragglers) would support the party’s chosen candidates because they had nowhere else to go. And that was pretty much true. Democrats could count on the far left to vote for Democrats.Now, we’re in 2018 and everything has changed! —everything, that is, except for the position of the Democratic party, which hasn’t moved at all.The Democratic party leadership is stuck with the same policy perspective they had in the past, but today they no longer represent the Median Democrat which shifted to the left. Of course, there are lots of Democrats who still support the party’s centrist agenda. Some of them are right here on Quora, and no doubt they’ll respond negatively to this answer. But there is no mistaking that the liberal-minded voters have moved dramatically to the left, thanks in no small part to Bernie Sanders who gave us all something to hope for.It is no longer true that the voters on the far left will support the Democratic party’s candidates on the basis that they have nowhere else to go. They are no longer voting for Democrats, and that’s what makes the party so weak. Those far-left liberals feel that voting for an establishment Democrat (such as Joe Crowley, Nancy Pelosi or Chuck Schumer) is no different than voting for a Republican, because these party centrists do not represent liberal interests.In the party’s desperate attempt to unite left-leaning and centrist liberals and bring the left back to the party’s center, the Democrats have come up with a bold strategy to defeat Donald Trump. Their strategy is simply this: We are not Trump! You should see how bad the other guys are! We hate Trump, just like you do! We will defeat Trump if you vote for us! Vote for us because we will fight against Trump’s policies! That’s the extent of their strategy. They have nothing of their own to offer.

To understand this completely, you ought to study the career of FDR and the man. Here is a start:Franklin D. Roosevelt - WikipediaNote that:FDR attended Groton School, Harvard College, and Columbia Law School, and went on to practice law in New York City. In 1905, he married his fifth cousin once removed, Eleanor Roosevelt. They had six children. He won election to the New York State Senate in 1910, and then served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy under President Woodrow Wilson during World War I.Assistant Secretary of the Navy is a major political appointment. Very much not a “nothing” job. It is not quite a cabinet level posting. FDR was related to Teddy Roosevelt and a scion of a very political family.So was the Wilson administration racist much?The Racist Legacy of Woodrow WilsonAs president, Wilson oversaw unprecedented segregation in federal offices. It’s a shameful side to his legacy that came to a head one fall afternoon in 1914 when he threw the civil-rights leader William Monroe Trotter out of the Oval Office.How the black middle class was attacked by Woodrow Wilson’s administrationRacism had always been a part of life in Washington and its government buildings, but the U.S. civil service had never been formally segregated prior to Wilson’s inauguration.( . . .)After the Civil War, thousands of African Americans took the national civil service examination and pulled political strings to land good jobs with decent pay in federal offices. That route to social mobility for educated and hard-working black Americans was closed off by the time Wilson convinced Americans to fight for democracy in World War I.(. . .)Wilson’s administration saw not just the end of a few careers of black Republicans and its impact was not merely the result of one man’s prejudice.Instead, in its attack on a nationally known and symbolic black middle class, “federal segregation” signaled the U.S. government’s support for a national racial regime in which African Americans were not only politically disfranchised but also professionally and economically hobbled.Black men and women who worked in Washington, DC, at the turn of the 20th century were functional members of the national government doing the nation’s business. Their numbers grew steadily well into the new century, as I have detailed in my book, Racism in the Nation’s Service. In 1912, every dollar printed by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing bore the signature of James C. Napier, a black man who served as Register of the Treasury.Woodrow Wilson was extremely racist — even by the standards of his timeWoodrow Wilson was, in fact, a racist pig. He was a racist by current standards, and he was a racist by the standards of the 1910s, a period widely acknowledged by historians as the ""nadir"" of post–Civil War race relations in the United States.Easily the worst part of Wilson's record as president was his overseeing of the resegregation of multiple agencies of the federal government, which had been surprisingly integrated as a result of Reconstruction decades earlier. At an April 11, 1913, Cabinet meeting, Postmaster General Albert Burleson argued for segregating the Railway Mail Service. He took exception to the fact that workers shared glasses, towels, and washrooms. Wilson offered no objection to Burleson's plan for segregation, saying that he ""wished the matter adjusted in a way to make the least friction.""Both Burleson and Treasury Secretary William McAdoo took Wilson's comments as authorization to segregate.This is the Administration that FDR joined in 1913, and served until 1920. Note he took an active part in segragation of the Navy Department.Screenshot of story from newspaper “Chicago Defender” 15 October 1932, during the last bit of the 1932 presidential election. The “Chicago Defender” was a black owned & operated newspaper intended for a black audience.Nor were bathrooms in the building the only thing FDR segregated at that post. He ran long service highly qualified black petty officers out of the Navy. He did so on wholly racist grounds, regardless of the damage done to combat readiness and military capability of the US Navy — during the lead up to US involvement in WWI. In other words, during a wartime situation.Note also, FDR did not undo even one of the racist acts of the Wilson administration. That had to wait for Truman.I think it rather obvious that FDR did not think Hugo Black being in the KKK, was an issue, as long as it was not making a scandal in the papers. He worked for W. Wilson, and deliberatly set up segragation on orders from Wilson, and never rescinded those orders when he was president.",547,12,525,"2,148",1,5

4,Why did Franklin Roosevelt nominate a Klansman to the Supreme Court?,Franklin D. Roosevelt,U.S. Supreme Court,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Several good answers here, but there’s an aspect I haven’t seen addressed that the Smithsonian article mentions. It tells us a lot about how the Deep South in the 1920s and even up into the 1960s was a very different place from here and now, and that’s the reference to the KKK as practically “a fraternal organization”. It really was in that place and time, and that’s a strong indictment of the social organization of the US at that point. The KKK had become a regular feature of life in the South (and other places, but particularly there) to the point that it had effects on the lives of the majority of white people well beyond the openly racist activities. (I omit further mention of its effects on the lives of black people only because that is much better known.) Especially for someone like a lawyer or a salesman, where “contacts” and “networking” is important, it would have been difficult to avoid at the least significant contact with the KKK. Again, let me be very clear that I think this is strong evidence of how broken in a fundamental way our society was at that point, but I recognize it as the reality of the place and time.I’m also not intending to excuse Black’s association with the Klan. I understand it, and I don’t regard him as being as morally culpable as the people who wore sheets at night, burned crosses, and held lynchings. He doesn’t get off scot free, but the issue, if you’ll pardon the turn of phrase, isn’t simply black and white.It’s part of a nuanced picture of a man’s life. Interesting parallels can be drawn to Robert Byrd (whom another answer completely misrepresents), whose case appears very much like Black’s, and George Wallace, whose case is less similar due to his actual virulent racism. Wallace is particularly fascinating because he was not very racist in his early career but after losing an election and (in)famously proclaiming that he wasn’t ever “going to get out-niggered again”, became much more vociferously racist for much of his career. But like Byrd and Black, he changed both in word and action to the point where he got 90% of the black vote in his last run for governor. These are three men whose stories can teach us a lot about both the realities of life in the Southern US before and during the Civil Rights Era and about how people can truly change even on such a divisive and morally charged issue.",441,13,543,"4,372",0,0
4,Why did Franklin Roosevelt nominate a Klansman to the Supreme Court?,Franklin D. Roosevelt,U.S. Supreme Court,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Hugo Black nomination[edit]One of Roosevelt's most severe political defeats during his presidency was the failure of the Judiciary Reorganization Bill of 1937, popularly known as the court-packing bill, which sought to stack a hostile Supreme Court in his favor by adding more associate justices.[1]Soon after this setback, however, Roosevelt obtained his first opportunity to appoint a Supreme Court Justice when conservative Willis Van Devanter retired. Roosevelt wanted the replacement to be a ""thumping, evangelical New Dealer"" who was reasonably young, confirmable by the Senate, and from a region of the country unrepresented on the Court.[2]The three final candidates were Solicitor General Stanley Reed, Indiana Senator Sherman Minton, and Alabama Senator Hugo Black.[3]Roosevelt said Reed ""had no fire,"" and Minton didn't want the appointment at the time.[3]Black was a candidate from the South who as a senator had voted for all twenty-four of Roosevelt's major New Deal programs,[3]and had been an outspoken advocate of the court-packing plan. Roosevelt admired Black's use of the investigative role of the Senate to shape the American mind on reforms, his strong voting record, and his early support, which dated back to 1933.[4]On August 12, 1937, Roosevelt nominated Black to fill the vacancy. For the first time since 1853, the Senate departed from its tradition, which had been to confirm the appointment of a sitting Senator without debate.[5]Instead, it referred the nomination to the Judiciary Committee.[5]Black was criticized by other senators and Newsweek for his presumed bigotry, his cultural roots, and later when it became public, his Klan membership,[6]but the Committee recommended Black's confirmation by a vote of 13–4 on August 16.[7]The next day the full Senate considered Black's nomination.[5]Rumors relating to Black's involvement in the Ku Klux Klan surfaced among the senators,[6]and Democratic Senators Royal S. Copeland and Edward R. Burke urged the Senate to defeat the nomination. However, no conclusive evidence of Black's involvement was available at the time, so after six hours of debate, the Senate voted 63–16 to confirm Black;[8]ten Republicans and six Democrats voted against Black.[6]He resigned from the Senate and was sworn in as an Associate Justice two days later; Black would later explain that the haste in resigning was to avoid fallout from his Klan membership potentially going public.[9] Roosevelt didn’t know of his affiliation with the Klan until “after” he nominated him. I will also point out, he was confirmed by the senate to the Supreme Court.",175,2,44,"1,018",0,24

Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, all of these primarily benefit people who are not especially wealthy.As for non-ideological reasons why people don’t otherwise vote for the Greens or other parties with either socialist leanings or agendas that closely resemble the current policies of many European countries, these parties lack the infrastructure. They do not have sufficient numbers, they do not have enough public recognition, they lack the funding, and they generally don’t have enough media savvy.It doesn’t help that they are often misrepresented by outside interests, or that some of them have a few ideas about government than most people consider very strange—and that their less-strange ideas will often get adopted by the Democratic Party, usually in a watered-down fashion (see: Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid).There’s also the little fact that the current system of voting makes any election a long shot. You need to win a plurality of the vote. It’s appallingly difficult to do this if you aren’t a member of one of the two major parties.The only reason Bernie Sanders was able to win statewide office the first time was due to his very solid tenure as Mayor of Burlington, VT, the largest city in the state. Most independent politicians either gained recognition as a member of one of the big two parties, or were independently famous for non-political reasons and decided they didn’t want to run as a member of one of the parties.As for Bernie’s current political career? The longest-serving independent in Congress still ran in the Democratic primary to make a run for the White House. Without the party infrastructure that has been built over decades, or enormous sums of money to recreate it, there was no way he could otherwise win.Currently he is building a liberal infrastructure that is semi-independent of the Democratic Party. He is spending his time and gathering a lot of volunteered expertise. It might be a flash in the pan, but he is building with a lot of people to either remake the party or be ready to become a new party in the still-unlikely event that a big party falls.On the other side politically, the Koch brothers founded the Libertarian Party. It’s still there. It is the largest party outside the big two.But most of their political money has been spent to influence Republican politics, policies and pundits. And this has worked for them for advancing their corporate agenda a lot better than the creation of the Libertarian Party.People won’t seriously vote for your candidate in large numbers if they are sure that they have no chance of winning.

You may declare Democrat, Republican, any of a number of minor parties depending on where you live, or independent (no party at all).

In states with “open primaries”, you may select which party’s primary election you want to vote in on election day, but you may only vote in one.

Norman Borlaug - BiographicalYou know anyone else single-minded enough to spend his entire career helping the poorest people on Earth grow more food? Norman Borlaug can be said, with only a very slight exaggeration, to have saved literally billions of human lives. He is revered in places like India and Mexico, regions that used to be synonymous with famine and starvation. There are countless people alive right now because of Norman Borlaug.He spearheaded what is known as the Green Revolution of the mid-20th century. Dr. Borlaug brought science to agriculture and successfully introduced new techniques in a vast array of agricultural sub-fields, ultimately bringing a high-yielding short-strawed, disease-resistant wheat to farmers around the world. He introduced new techniques of planting and managing crops and through his work in genetics, plant breeding, and soil science developed better pesticides, crops, and spent most of the rest of his life training scientists in agricultural research and production methods.If I were a believer I’d say he should be made a saint.What has America ever done that was so great? Consistently provided the world with smart people dedicated to making the world a better place. Dr. Borlaug may be the best example but he is far from the only one.

40,What has the USA ever done that is so great?,Democratic Party (US politics),Republican Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"I think three points can answer this question:The US is the world’s first liberal democracy. It was the first country to implement the ideals of the Enlightenment on a political level. These included equal opportunity, freedom of speech, the separation of church and state, representative government, etc.According to HW Brands, the US has had the largest population, with the highest standard of living, for the longest period of time, of any country or society in human history. This is due to our capitalist economy and the concept of the “American Dream.”The US played a leading and indispensable role in defeating Germany and Japan in World War II. This helped save the world from totalitarian dominance. The US then constructed what is called the Liberal International Order, which applies our Enlightenment ideals to global politics. Countries were no longer allowed to annex each other, free trade was encouraged, and international organizations like the UN help keep the peace. This has helped produce the freest and most peaceful period in human history.For more of my writing, check out “The Eisenhower Encyclopedia” at www.dwighteisenhower.net",3.8k,41,119,145,0,1
40,What has the USA ever done that is so great?,Democratic Party (US politics),Republican Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"A perspective of a non american( as well never been to The USA).The present USA was predestined to be great. Several points could be raised, but just a few are going to be presented here. First, quite the opposite people say, Natural Resources. USA is plenty of natural resources no matter mineral, agricultural,etc. Second: Americans had the heritage of England where Industrial Revolution Started. Even England and USA are both located in Northern Hemisphere helped a lot. Crossing the North Atlantic from London to NYC is not so hard as coming from Spain to Argentina, or coming from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro, for example.At the beggining, of colonizing, the present USA was not so promissing. Gold and Silver were not so visible( just much more late there were rush golds to California and Alaska, for example), not even coal and oil. Partially because such fuels were not widely still used. That part of North America had a sparce population, different from Aztecs at Mexico and Incas at Peru. So, there´s a tale, that The King of England ordered their ""managers"" to exploit that regions as the Spanish were doing with other parts of America. Try to get all wealth the region has no matter the pain to local people. But as I mentioned, gold and silver were not clearly available, a sparce population did not fit to be enslaved. Bringing Black Slaves for Africa, showed a little cost/benefit( just later Black slavery was introduced in the south of USA). So, British Crown,had to change its mind an start thinking. Let the guys there alone and get just what they could provide. So, such people somehow let alone, as well having the protestant influence to get rid of illiteracy( first for reading The Bible), started colonizing the country, learned to get the resources and in a catalysis process that feeds itself, built a people educated and laborius.The result just could be so good. Because soon there were advantages as:Minerals for fuel as coal( for example we don´t have such vital fuel to start an industrialization at Brazil).Oil( again, our oil in Brazil, the gross is in deep waters, no technology available for centuries)Area for Agriculture.Much more:Soon they had access to two oceans, a vast integrared territory centuries before EU, for example. And this vast territory, with 2 oceans to access, having a population virtually speaking just one Language and with one currency.To sum it up: How could such “Land of Promise” not being succesfull.",4.3k,28,92,413,0,0

We have used that original document for longer than any other country. Why? Because it works.Our democratic society became the envy of the world. European democracies were all more or less based on values and systems they had seen developed in the United States. Some, like the French, failed miserably at first. Most took a very long time to develop a stable, successful government. It took us a handful of years.We established a public schooling system that kept virtually every citizen educated, even those on the frontier during 19th century expansion. For decades, we had the most informed and educated population on earth. Even now, our universities are considered top notch. Why else would people from Japan, Northern Europe, and other places well-known for superior education immigrate here for the chance to learn at American universities?Our free-market capitalist economy has provided for the development and proliferation of some of the world’s most important technologies. Do you enjoy having electric light bulbs? Thank Thomas Edison, an American. Do you like how virtually anyone in a developed society can afford an automobile, instead of only the elite? Thank Henry Ford. How do you like televisions and telephones? Ever use them? Thank American inventors. Then there’s the big boy, the game changer that utterly transformed our world in the course of three short decades: the internet. You can thank the US military for that one.It was our intervention in World War II that won the cause for the Allies. We liberated France on D-Day, costing us thousands of young lives. The organizer of the invasion, of course, was American Dwight D. Eisenhower. This marked the turning point in the war, and the Third Reich fell soon after. Our participation was key in preventing Nazi fascism from consuming the entirety of Europe. You’re welcome, Europe.We rid the Pacific of the Japanese Empire. Innumerable atrocities were committed on both sides, including the tragic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but Japanese who lived during the war thank Americans today for freeing them from the oppressive militarism of their erstwhile empire.After the war, America invested huge sums of money in rebuilding their defeated enemies. This was a tremendous act of generosity and savvy, gaining us strong allies and establishing stability in the regions once ravaged by war.Do you like that there are free Koreans not subject to Kim Jong Un’s regime? Thank the fifty thousand soldiers who died on Korean soil to make it happen. For that matter, America is largely responsible for the spread of democracy to once oppressed nations throughout the 20th century, whether to formerly fascist or communist countries. Our stand against Russia prevented millions from being trapped in the abject poverty of North Korea, Venezuela, and Soviet Russia.We fought for years against terrorism in Iraq and Afghanistan. We contributed to the defeat of the horrifying ISIS regime. We work to keep Russia, an international bully, out of Middle Eastern countries. We still work to promote freedom everywhere.It’s true, we have made a lot of mistakes. We have intruded in places where I think we ought not to have intruded, and a lot of people throughout the world view us as arrogant and self-serving. I understand that, especially given our foreign policy and global economics over the past couple of decades. But so much of the world owes their freedom, directly or indirectly, to American ideas, inventions, money, and military.

5,Does the Far Right exist because Democrats have moved to the right?,Far Right Politics,Democrats (non-specific),Political Spectrum,1!,1!,1!,"Yes. Basically.The Democrats moved to the right under Clinton and Obama.They were very pro free trade. Clinton signed Nafta and helped bring China into the WTO. They were relatively hands off of Wall Street. And seduced by big money and big tech. Seeing their role as to cheer-lead and support American corporations.When the lax regulation allowed Wall Street (and the City of London) to blow up the world economy in 2008, Obama ensured that the banks got bailed out. And kept the US / world economy afloat. But did far too little to address the problems faced by ordinary people. Obama could, for example, have saved the banks by simply buying everyone’s mortgage and turning them into long-term, low interest loans from the government to the householders. This would have cost no more than the actual Quantitative Easing policies but have pushed the money to where people were really suffering.But of course, he did nothing but play the game the way Big Finance (including finance that donated to the Democrats) wanted him to play it. More money was created. More of it ended up in the pockets of the bankers. And inequality exploded.By the time the mid 2010s came around, with the world economy still in a slump because of 2008, but with waves of disruption to the traditional American working class due to the shifts in manufacturing to China and disruptive new technologies, the Democrats literally had no story to tell the American working class : either to explain why, despite the official figures looking OK, their local economies and quality of life just seemed to be declining. Or to explain how Democrats would make things better.This left a vacuum for another kind of narrative. A narrative which stated that working class Americans had been sold-out by “liberal elites”, who were too fixated on taking care of minorities and exotic special interest groups and despised, or took for granted, the “ordinary” American working class. Liberal elites who benefited from all the cheap labour due to illegal immigration, and cheap stuff due to Chinese imports, but didn’t give a fuck about the factories closing in the rust-belt and the communities decimated by an extinguishing economy.It’s not that America didn’t always have a problem with racism and a hard-right fringe. But this was a defeasible minority.But in the vacuum left by a Democratic party who had no plausible criticism of the evolving hyper-globalization, those voices started to have some appeal to the working class looking for an explanation of what was going wrong in their country and community, and how it could be fixed.Related :Phil Jones' answer to With the left and the right getting more extreme will those in the center fad away or will they fight back.?Phil Jones' answer to What do you think about modern right-wing populism?",207,10,4k,"6,127",0,0

Bernie Sanders not too long ago called open borders advocacy shilling for the billionaire class.A Democrat who called for stricter controls on illegal immigration would be called a fascist, as a lifelong liberal and columnist for Out magazine learned the hard way. Better yet, try being a Democrat and accepting NRA donations. Never mind that the NRA once endorsed Bernie (that’s one I bet they wish they could have back).In sum, try being a Democrat who opposes illegal immigration, criminalizing hate speech, single payer healthcare, or banning “assault weapons”. The Democrats have done many things since the Obama years; but one thing they certainly haven’t done is “move to the right”.

5,Does the Far Right exist because Democrats have moved to the right?,Far Right Politics,Democrats (non-specific),Political Spectrum,1!,1!,1!,"This is a great question.. this is one of those questions where one question can be unpacked into another, and then another…Alright where to start. I’m a libertarian. I am far right. The only ones further to the right than I am, and when you go further right you get more individual freedom(and responsibility) and less government control, are anarchists, and anarcho-capitalists. That’s how its always been… none of this is new. In fact, the founders of America would best be described as libertarian. So there’s always been a far right, before even the Democrat party existed, and it’s probably fair to say the entire country has been extremely far right, all the way up until the mid 20th century. Recently I’d say the far right is waning actually.. the most recent peak was Ron Paul, years ago. The Tea Party surge has come and gone, and well, maybe left a bit of a mark. But Donald Trump is center right. He’s no libertarian and he is not far right.What I think you’re asking is, does the “alt-right” exist because of Democrats? I’d say that answer is yes. Recently the Democrats have shifted into the realm of identity politics. If you listen to some 90’s era Democrats, or even early Obama, they sound nothing like late era Obama or HRC era Democrats. In the last decade there was a move into identity politics. Into immigrant oppression, LGBT rights, feminism, Islam, combating able-ism, etc. This created an identity group without a home: the able, proud, white, christian, cis-gendered, heterosexual male.Now it seems logical and natural to think that if the Left includes all of these identity groups, and all who sympathize with these identity groups, then anyone who advocates for the excluded group (white hetero cis males), opposes them and therefore must be on the Right. But that is not true at all. The Right side of the political spectrum is about individual responsibility, protection of liberty, and less government control. Same as it’s been. It’s not about identity politics. The ideal on the Right is that no American should use their identity for a political end.So where does this orphaned group belong? Because now, you have two ideologies opposing the Democrats in two different ways, The Right opposes them because the Right wants small government and less regulation, and the Left wants more. The “alt Right” opposes them because the Left is now pro-women, pro-minority, pro-LGBT, and pro-Islam, and they feel someone should stand up for the white male, and.. this is very important.. that idea is not welcomed on the Right. That idea is a completely new animal, created recently. Remember the Right does not want identity politics, that’s why the group is the “alt-Right”, and not simply the “Right”. And it’s not the “far Right”, because when you go further right, you don’t get more identity politics, you just get less government and Libertarians like me.Alright I hope that helps - maybe I veered a bit far from your question, and i’m not sure i hit the mark but hopefully it was worth the trip.",126,1,5,66,0,0

Unfortunately a few days late though, owing to my being stuck out in the Catskills for some reason, but that’s just a few more days for polls and California late returns to trickle in.Right now my forecast has barely budged from when this question was last asked; I still have Democrats as underdogs (but not severe underdogs) to take back the House, with probability 42%:Projected: 214 Democratic seats. Middle 50%: 205–226 seats.This is in spite of several weeks of primaries that have settled the fields in several big states. Most notably, California saw Democrats claim second place in four competitive Republican-held districts, thus ensuring them a place on the general election ballot in November. But while making it past the first hurdle is definitely a good result for them, it’s not much more—the share of the two-party vote going to Democrats in the 2018 primaries has been consistent, historically, with narrow general election losses.Specifically, if you find the Democratic share of the two-party vote in each of those four competitive districts on the horizontal axis and move up vertically to the black diagonal line, you’ll end up a tiny bit below 0.50 on the vertical axis.At any rate, the primaries could only have decided, at a maximum, four competitive seats ahead of the general election—even if Democrats had flunked out of second in all four it wouldn’t have had a large direct effect on the forecast; probably Republicans would’ve been at about 61% or something (although it sure would’ve been a disturbing omen for their November chances had that actually happened).More important is that the Democratic lead on the generic congressional ballot is pretty much where it stood a month ago, and that’s pretty clearly the most important factor in this forecast.The story’s similarly unchanged in the Senate, with the most important difference of course being that Republicans still have a pretty solid grip on the Senate. The latest forecast has Democrats at a 5% chance to pick up the chamber:Projected: 47 Democratic seats. Middle 50%: 45–49 seats.They were bolstered by some recent polls in Ohio and Pennsylvania, which showed the Democratic incumbents with hefty leads over their Republican challengers in two Rust Belt states that they’d feared were trending red following the 2016 election. But Ohio and Pennsylvania, where the incumbents are relatively popular, weren’t ever really the truly critical problems for the Democratic math—even if Ohio and Pennsylvania are off the table, Indiana, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, and West Virginia are still on it.

With the love of autocracy of those who have been in a position to give orders to underlings all his life.But his executive orders, withdrawal from treaties, and administrative appointments have been doing the bidding of the wealthy capitalist elite, his real “constituency” as Chomsky put it. This is what Steve Bannon has called “the deconstruction of the administrative state.” But that’s disingenuous. Trump is happy to give an even more extreme level of utter impunity to local police and ICE agents — as with Sessions ending investigations of civil rights violations by police. So the steel fist of the state is fine with them.So this has involved attacks on public education (such as attacking requirement of provisions for disabled students), attacks on affordable housing subsidies, cuts to food stamps, withdrawal from the climate change treaty, attacks on even the ability of EPA to collect data on global warming, removal of regulations on fracking, on chemical exposures of workers (as with asbestos), cuts to Medicaid.The people who benefit from these kinds actions are the carbon cartel & petro-chemical industry (the people Pruitt shills for), and the corporate elite in general. The rich are also the people who benefit from the tax cut. The point to these tax cuts, since Reagan, is to undermine the ability of the state to fund social benefits. So with cuts to federal revenue, the idea is that down the road there will be pressure to cut things like Medicare and Social Security.Since the “southern strategy” of the ’70s and the absorption of the racist Dixiecrats the politics of “white identity” appeals to white racial resentment is part of the extreme Social Darwinist policy of the Republicans.

16,What do you make of Noam Chomsky's idea that Trump's role is to distract the public while his administration dismantles everything of benefit to the American people?,Major Issues in US Politics,US & World Politics,1!,1!,1!,1!,"I am a fan of Chomsky and agree with his deeply thoughtful insights much more often than not. What people seem to recognize least about Trump is that in many ways he is like the second coming of Reagan. Where Reagan’s persona was the grandfather looking out for America and what is best for Americans, Trump’s is as the sharp businessman with the guts to stand up for what is right.Both Reagan and Trump were/are regularly shockingly factually untruthful. Reagan’s press secretary Larry Speakes was nicknamed “Larry Misspeaks” because of how often he had to go to his podium and announce “the President misspoke.”What does “misspoke” mean? That the President lied? That the President addressed a subject with which he had insufficient knowledge? That the President was simply mistaken? Although often asked to explain what “misspoke” meant when he said it, Speakes was careful to never answer that question, to always leave the ambiguity.And that was an important part of what made Reagan the “teflon president”. Never clarify such points, leave them to interpretation but always with at least one reasonable interpretation presented by his supporters so it wouldn’t break the “good grandfather looking out for our best interests” myth. Reagan’s grandfatherly manner and gracious presence made his regular untruths palatable to those who agreed with him in principle. His supporters were willing to forgive his regular misstatements because he gave them a higher “truth” they found plausible.And so it is with Trump. Different persona but operating under the same kind of mantle of forgiveness. Trump isn’t the grandfatherly voice speaking wisdom, Trump is the blunt, canny, no bullshit businessman with the patriotism and business insights to put aside the confounding and contentious political blather and do what America needs to be “great” once more. Just as Reagan did, Trump regularly gets a pass for his nonsense because of his persona. In fact, Trump is well on his way toward seizing the “teflon president” mantle from his predecessorPersonas are all well and good but what both personas mask and masked is critically important: neither president had much knowledge of what was actually going on in their administrations beyond broad strokes. Each of them appointed people to responsible positions where they could undermine all efforts of the government to help people. All of their respective appointees were in essence invisible gremlins chipping away at the things that truly made America great under the cover of their president saying he wanted to “restore” America’s former power and glory.So in this sense, Chomsky is entirely correct. Well, except perhaps for the “completely” part. Trump is not a detail person, quite the opposite. And he constantly gets distracted by his own ego. Moreover, while his minions may have Chomsky’s fear as their goal, I don’t think they are thorough-going enough to destroy everything of benefit. As a rule I am not sure they are smart enough or have sufficient vision to destroy everything.Plus, there is institutional push-back and even occasionally some elected Republicans in the legislature who are of sufficient conscience to risk the wrath of Trump’s base by resisting some of the more draconian cutbacks and changes proposed by Trump’s appointees.Now, as for Trump’s role as a distraction, yes, his ability to take command of the news cycle with his outrageousness is important to avoid public debate on many constant individual chippings away of benefits Americans now enjoy. Ultimately, if Trump is successful, the very rich and corporations will have protected rights and privileges, the rest of us not so much.Chomsky has correctly identified Trump’s role in diminishing the benefits of American citizenship but perhaps overstates Trump’s competence and the competence of his gremlins and even of some occasional push-back from Republican elected representatives who suddenly discover their backbones or from American majorities who come to recognize particular excesses of Trump’s minions, both of which we have already seen.The implication many would recognize from Chomsky’s statement is that there is some author, whether Trump himself or a cabal of wealthy Americans or some other stealthy person or group making a conscious effort to affect this change. But such inference is unfounded. I doubt Trump could conceive of such a plan and act on it, I doubt he could stay on such a plan if it were authored by other actors. I think the greatest part of what Chomsky said is true but I doubt it is the result of some nefarious scheme or will result in Americans losing all benefits of their government. I think most of what Trump is attempting to do is a result of misguided personal interests and venality. That said, my opinion is hardly dispositive of the issue.Trump is this generation’s Reagan, a meaner Reagan for a meaner world. Reagan’s eight year tenure as president, his lack of attention to detail, and his misunderstandings and wrong-headed beliefs resulted in the appointment of more officials who ended up being prosecuted and going to prison for misconduct in office than any administration before or since. I wouldn’t be surprised if Trump, with those same failings, is able to surpass that record in a mere four years.Trump’s “vision” and unspoken goal seems to be to make America the largest banana republic in the world by destroying the differences between the America generations of Americans have built and actual banana republics, all of which is what he seems to think is synonymous with greatness.As Trump himself is wont to say, sad!",258,19,18,45,0,0

They not only dominate our economy, but they use the government to increase their wealth and power.Witness the recent Republican tax scam that borrowed trillions to give the rich and corporations a massive tax cut, while throwing a small temporary cut to the working class to make it seem fair and balanced. It wasn’t.Witness the Trump administration gutting regulations that protect our environment and denying climate change. Corporations profit from those changes.Witness the GW Bush administration recommending that taxpayers bail out Wall Street banks who made corrupt risky bets but then were deemed too big to fail. They recently got Congress to reduce regulations designed to protect against a repeat of that process, while Congress has allowed the too big banks to merge so that today there are fewer and bigger too big to fail banks.Welfare for oil companies.A separate preferential tax code for the investor class with much lower tax rates than paid by working class people on their salaries.Witness McConnell refusing to allow Obama to get a hearing for a moderate Supreme Court judge Garland, then changing Senate rules to push through the most corporate friendly jusdge they could find = Gorsuch.

When the other guys are promising tax cuts and deregulation, you shouldn't be focused on presenting your liberal views on transgender bathrooms and open borders as the alternative.On top of that, the left needs to quickly denounce the anti-free speech, antifa-associated college left. This will not lose them any voters, but it will gain them some respect.Lastly, illegal immigration should not be the hill the left chooses to die on. Again, focusing less on granting privileges to illegals will not lose the Dems any votes, but it will better their image, which at the moment appears to be that of a party more concered with illegals than actual Americans.For specific issues…AbortionThe left can stop demonizing the pro-life camp as women-hating deplorables and sit down to have a meaningful debate. They should also go back to the “safe, legal, and rare” approach of Bill Clinton, instead of the despicable “shout your abortion” types of campaigns that are popping up these days.WelfareMatthew Bates basically has this figured out. The left can win over religious voters on this issue by spamming Bible verses of helping the poor. This doesn't have to be on a national level, as that would ruin their image among the anti-religious left, but it could help them win local races in more religious areas. The condescending comparisons to Europe also need to stop, as every conservative commentator has already pointed out the many downsides and differences of European welfare states.EnvironmentThe left needs to let this issue take a backseat in local races, especially in areas with coal-mining and oil industries. People don't take kindly when your stated goals are destroying the industry they work in. The left can still continue to incentivize green technologies and development.Gun-controlThe left has to make it clear that their end goal isn't a blanket gun ban (which many gun control enthusiasts are calling for now), and they should only push for moderate reform to a certain limit. The left should also stop blocking attempts to post armed guards at every school. More importantly, they should stop with the rhetoric that the NRA is some big, evil lobby group that doesn't care about the American people and is only backed by big corporations.

5,How badly would splitting California into 3 states hurt the Democrats running for President?,Cal 3 Proposal (2018 ballot measure),Politics of California,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Here’s California’s 2016 electoral map:And here is the proposed split, also conveniently along county lines:We can see that there’s not much contest in the new California; Los Angeles and the Gold Coast counties making up the new California proper would be pretty firmly Democrat. Northern California is similarly sewn up; the primary population center is the Bay Area, about 8 million total, against about a million in the Sacramento metro and maybe a million more in the remaining rural counties and small towns. Modoc County (northeast corner) and its southern neighbor Lassen County can be as Republican as they want; between the two counties we’re talking about less than 50,000 people. Similarly right-leaning Shasta, Tehama and Glenn counties, between them, represent about 250k. San Francisco County by itself (880k people in the very tip of the southern peninsula sheltering San Francisco Bay) can overrule all of that.Southern California is a bit more of a challenge; San Diego is less reliably Democrat, in part due to a major military base north of San Diego (Camp Pendleton) which reddens the resident population considerably.Yeah, there are still Democrat majorities in each slice, but when you dilute the state’s Democrat surplus of over 3 million votes three ways, the opposition sees more chances, and gets bolder.Overall, if all three new states continue to vote majority-Democratic, the Democrats would gain a net of 4 more Senators and Electors, assuming the split doesn’t affect the total number of Representatives apportioned among the former California (that’s not a guarantee; the three states, with less population each and thus closer to other States in population, could gain or lose a few depending on exactly how the mathematical prioritization of each seat pans out in the Huntington-Hill method; the analysis estimates four new Representatives as well). 4 additional Democratic Senators, given the current Senate split, would give the Dems a majority they’d be hard-pressed to lose in the current climate.The estimated 8 new electoral votes is somewhat less of a big deal, and the risk here is larger. Let’s say that, instead of splitting into 3, California voted to assign Presidential electors proportionately; the Electors representing Senate seats would go to the popular vote winner, then the remaining 53 of Cali’s 55 votes would be split to match the popular vote split. Had that been the case in 2016, Trump would have gotten an additional 17 electoral votes from California, swinging the electoral margin further in his favor by 34 votes. That’s about the same as he’d have done by flipping Southern California red in this 3-state model, and he’d get that state’s 2 Senate-based electors as well, which would cancel out two from the other 2 new states leaving the Dems with a wash of “Senate-based” electors and down between 15 and 20 Southern Californian electors that go to Trump. Keep in mind, Trump lost the popular vote, but by getting electors from California in either a proportional or state-splitting electoral model, his margin of electoral victory would have been even higher.(BTW, if the entire country had gone proportional, Trump would still have won if the “Senate-based” electors go to each State’s popular vote winner, but the electoral count would be more like 281–257 instead of 306–232, because Trump took 34 states to Clinton’s 16 plus DC, so he would have a 34-vote lead - 68 to 34 - while Clinton’s 2.25% popular vote advantage would only have been worth 9 or 10 electors out of the remaining 436.)So, if the Republican takes Southern California, the Dems would lose electors they are currently very certain to win, and which they count on in Presidential elections as certainly as the GOP needs Texas to win (flip Texas blue in any Presidential election since ‘84, including 2016, and the Democrat wins).Also, nobody really knows if all these counties would vote the same way they do now if the State were three smaller ones instead. A split in California’s geography would create smaller State House and State Senate districts, which could allow a more conservative overall voice from the states, which could then change votes at higher levels from the bottom up, as conservative local incumbents empower conservative Congressional candidates. That could further shift the balance of power, not just in the region but the country, as currently disenfranchised and discouraged California voters find more of a voice.In short, Democrats depend on a very healthy majority showing in the country’s most populous state. Splitting the state into 3 gains Dems only 8 votes and could likely cost them up to 20 if any of those states flipped. It’s just not good math for the Democratic Party, and you can bet the party will be very heavily campaigning to defeat this measure in November. Republicans, for their part, don’t want the Dems to get any more electors from this state and its population than they already do; California currently can be all but written off by the RNC, freeing resources to focus on more closely contested swing states. Putting between 15 and 20 of those in play in Southern California, with a possible net gain of 8 new electors for Dems over the current status quo, cannot be ignored; the RNC would be forced to fight for Southern California, spreading its resources that much thinner.",32.3k,167,656,"2,560",2,0
5,How badly would splitting California into 3 states hurt the Democrats running for President?,Cal 3 Proposal (2018 ballot measure),Politics of California,1!,1!,1!,1!,"It all depends on electoral votes - and how they’re allocated in each of the “new” states.Assuming “winner take all” in all three states (as present day California allocates Electors), than I expect that “new” California would vote Dem, The other two “new” Californias are less easy to predict, but I think Northern California stands a better than even chance of voting Dem - given that it will have the Greater Bay Area and Greater Sacramento area within it’s borders, and a 50/50 chance in Southern California.So it boils down to: If ANY of the new states go for the GOP, Dems will be hurt.And if any of the “new” states chooses to use Congressional district allocation of Electoral votes (like Oklahoma and Maine), then the Dems will be hurt, as there will be at least 5 Congressional districts that lean strongly GOP - counteracting the possible pickup (by the dems) of 4 Electors due to the Electors selected statewide (“representing” the 4 additional Senators)Tangent: The above analysis is, perhaps, reason enough for our present Dem delegation to Congress to vote against ratification (should the split make it to Congress, which I doubt would happen, but that’s another thread!)Original Question:How badly would splitting California into 3 states hurt the Democrats running for President?",342,6,33,894,0,0

5,How badly would splitting California into 3 states hurt the Democrats running for President?,Cal 3 Proposal (2018 ballot measure),Politics of California,1!,1!,1!,1!,"I’m a registered Democrat in the State of California. I’m also, for the sake of the general health of our body politic, an advocate for California changing the way it allocates electoral votes in Presidential elections. Among other changes, I’d like to see California (and all other states or any states created from splits of existing states) change to using the Congressional District Method form of elector allocation used by Maine and Nebraska, rather than statewide winner-take-all.I’d also like the United States Congress to change the number of seats in the House of Representatives to operate in accord with the Wyoming Rule (whereby the number of House seats to be apportioned is determined by how the population of each state relates to the population of the least populous state) rather than having it artificially capped at 435 by a law passed in 1929. Furthermore, I’d like the Congress to put forth a Constitutional Amendment to change the Electoral College process to a two round process whereby the first round has each state conducting its elections and selecting electors however it wants and the second round has all states put on the ballot the top two recipients of electoral votes from the first round. This would make Presidential elections a truly public process rather depending on political parties — which are ultimately private organizations — to act as the consensus-building and filtering mechanisms for elections. Parties should be completely free to undertake their own internal decision-making processes for who to support, but candidates need to emerge from public processes that treat the electorate as a unified body rather than one divided from the start.Finally, Democratic Party voters need to give up our unhealthy fixation on the Presidency and focus a LOT more on Congressional, state-level, and local races.I don’t see a split of California being able to happen anytime soon due to us all being highly entangled by water rights and pension obligations, but I think that dealing with our politics in smaller geographic and population units is — in general (with certain notable exceptions like upholding civil rights laws) — a positive direction that will help us as a nation and allow for easier realignments of factions into more dynamic political coalitions. While it will be a huge shift in the short term, in the long term it will help — not hurt — Presidential candidates from all political parties, including the Democrats, by creating new opportunities to stitch together bases of support.See also:Ian McCullough's answer to What are reasons for the extreme partisanship in American politics today?My Letter to My Lawmakers About Election Reform by Ian McCullough on Ian's Posts",2.3k,41,15.1k,"6,126",0,3

1,"Is it true that the South voted Democrat to oppose Republican A. Lincoln and then switched to Republican to oppose LBJ, each time over rights for black people?",Democratic Party (US politics),Republican Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"No, it is not true. The Democrat party was strong in the South fron the start of US political parties, the exception being the Appalacian Mountains and hillbillies were never strong Democrats, as compared to the rednecks in the Deltas.That can be seen even today here in Georgia. The moderate Republicans in GA think like Southern Democrats of the 50s and 60s. The Ted Cruz/Rand Paul type Republicans think like abolitionists. And this diffrerence in native Georgians has a correlation to how long they have been Republican.The question is also wrong at the other end of time. Goldwater got more votes than Ike from Southern whites. But in 1968 the 2 Democrats on the ballot carried the South overwhelmingly. Looking at the 1972 election helps understand the 1968 election.Nixon did well in the South in 1972. But look at the map. Nixon did well everywhere. That is because the entire country was pro-Vietnam war and even more so anti-war protestor and anti-communist.Take a look at the Democrat KKK and Democrat White Citizens Council in the 60s and 70s. When they used racist language their support existed but was weak. When they used anti-Comnunist language their support was much, much broader and deeper.When far right talkshow host Billy James Hargis if Little Rock hinted at racism his audience in both the South and North declined. But when he went anti-Comnunist his audience increased, especially in the South.Of course, a few civil rights workers fed right into the trap. In the 60s many civil rights workers were Edward Brooks Republicans. But a small, noisy subset of civil rights workers were YPSL/YSA types who openly advocated Communism. This gave the Democrat KKK/White Citizens Council ammunition with which to tie the two issues together.Of course, Jimny Carter was elected president because he did well in the South.The South went more Republican in 1980 because Reagan ran on defeating Communism, not just coexistence and MAD, like both R and D before him. It should be noted that Reagan was the first Republican ever to get a majority of the white Evangelucal/Fundamentalist vote. And this is largely because he was the first to broaden that vote in the South from the Appalachian hillbillies to the river bottom rednecks.But the question is about party and not candidate. The Republican party did not become the majority party in the South until the 1990s. In many parts of the South not until very recently. One white Congressional District in GA didn’t become Republican until 2016.So the South did not switch to Republican over LBJ. It has been a 55 year process. Democrats soft on Communism who appear anti-American has been by far the biggest factor in that shift, especially in the 60s and 70s.Pro-life has been the second biggest factor. But it did not become a factor until ChristianCoalition/ MoralMajority/Ralph Reed (GOP state chair in GA) started to figure it out around 1988.Race has been an issue with some Democrats. It is not a top tier issue wrh Republucans, certainly not with Southern Republicans.It should be noted that Nixon ran on Democrats soft on crime. This was aimed directly at turning the Northern Vito Marzullo/Lipinski Democrats into Republicans and associating the Days of Rage and anti-war protests with the Demcrats.Ps. When I hitch hiked through the South in the 60s attending SNCC, CORE, KKK, White Citizens Council and similar events and sleeping in their houses, I billed myself as a student of sociology. I did not identify with a political party.My friends and I voted for Dick Gregory because we could not take that other conedian seriously.

1,What are the problems which undermine democratization process in Africa?,Democratic Party (US politics),Democracy,Africa,1!,1!,1!,"It isn’t just Africa, but, I will cover specific African roadblocks. I’ll start with pre colonial Africa. Africa is a wide range of places. Most run by kings, emperors, village chiefs. et al. Few give up power willingly.One of the best books I read on Africa I used as a research book for a project. Professor Frank McLynn, Hearts of Darkness. It’s a psychohistorical look at African exploration by Europeans, but also explained African societies, which varied from nomadic to settled. You have old societies, such as Ethiopia, rules by kings and emperors, Egypt, ruled by emperors, including Roman ones, then from 30BC to 1952, they were ruled by outsiders.Africa is a tough place to live (I’ve been to South Africa, but that’s another story). There is lots of land, but it’s hard to work. Most could not work beyond subsistence. (Regardless of Malian emperor Mansa Musa, being the wealthiest man ever, throwing gold like baseballs, and depressing economies). The point? There was no even vague idea about asking the populace anything. In many places, you didn’t see anything above a village chief. Professor McLynn explained that working together was more like working toward a specific project, like digging a well, not politically getting together. The closest thing to democracy was village elders voting. Hunter Gatherer societies, which is how humanity lived for most of its existence, are collaborative and maybe democratic on a small scale.Farming societies have to be centralized to fight of people invading, and how to efficiently work and store crops.The Arabs brought Islam, but mainly stuck to the Sahara and Sahel. They certainly didn’t bring democracy.Europeans came, and they certainly weren’t there to spread democracy. Would Africa have developed democracy, without European influence later on their own? To use a fictional theme, the movie, Black Panther, if Wakanda is any indication, probably not. Or maybe long down the road, when the population became better educated.This leads to two things. One: How the Europeans divided Africa. They did it strictly for resources. Transportation went from interior to coast, cutting across traditional societies and ethnic lines. Now, you were throwing together people, who either traditionally not connected or were enemies. In the colony, the Europeans would choose one ethnic group to rule the others. I will use Rwanda as the example, because it’s the one I know most about. Traditional, the Tutsi’s were the cattle herding nobility and had the king. Before the Europeans, Rwanda was feudal. The Hutu majority tilled the land. They started out as separate ethnic groups, but became more like social classes. The one percent original population, the Pygmy Twa, stuck to the rainforest.The Germans only ran Rwanda for thirty years, and lost it to the Belgians. Belgium is a constitutional monarchy, but they certainly weren’t bringing Democracy to Rwanda. Using the popular scientific racism of the time, they solidified the Hutu-Tutsi divide, by giving the Tutsi’s the power in the colony. By the time of independence, the only thing both Hutu and Tutsi could agree on, was being independent of Belgium. After that, disagreement. The Tutsi wanted their king to rule. The Hutus wanted a democracy, because they would forever dominate. Here, I’m discussing a country, where religion and language are the same.What happens in a country that isn’t? In Uganda, The British favored the Baganda and their king. They favored the Northern tribes, on the South Sudan border for the military. (They did similar things in other places). Military had the guns, forget Democracy, that’s how you get Idi Amin.Africans returning from European education in the Colonial Era, brought Democracy, Capitalism, Marxism, etc. Many were the first leaders, who then became dictators, favoring and paying off their own ethnic group, or others to hold a nation together, within artificial borders.To conclude: We can see Democracy developing, but you need development and in most cases, if the colonial borders are kept, the colonial language has to become the main language to communicate. In Nigeria, a Hausa and an Ibo can’t speak to each other in their own languages. The East African nations of Rwanda, Burundi, Tanzania, Uganda, and Kenya might form a close union for economic reasons. Might include others down the road, but that is years away. So is Democracy hampered in Africa? Yes. Will it be down the road? Too soon to tell.",60,2,292,203,0,0

The truth is the Democrats did not have a supermajority until well into 2009. The Dem’s supermajority depended on the outcome of Al Franken’s race for senate in Minnesota. Franken’s race for the Senate was not decided until June 30, 2009. Franken was sworn in on July 7, 2009 and that’s when the Democrats had a supermajority—but this was only on paper.Remember that Senator Ted Kennedy was sick and unable to cast votes because he was battling brain cancer. Kennedy cast his final vote in the Senate in February 2009. He lost his battle with brain cancer on August 25, 2009 ending the Democrat’s theoretical supermajority.You see, the reality is the Democrats had a supermajority on paper from July 7, 2009 (when Franken was sworn in), and it ended 7 weeks later when Kennedy died.

2,What do you think about Donald Trump being right to demand a sunset clause in NAFTA?,North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Being right? He wasn’t - not at all.Bear in mind, that concept of a long-term trade agreement is one that allows companies to invest in the future, and that’s not something that’s limited to just a few short years. If a company or a corporation invest, they’re looking to develop business that could potentially last decades.The sunset clause effectively meant that the NAFTA provisions would expire within five years, and therefore have to be renegotiated. While that sounds fine, what happens if it isn’t effectively renegotiated five years down the line? What if provisions that apply today are withdrawn? What happens if companies have invested millions or billions, and then see that money go to waste as new tariffs come into place, or quotas are created that prevent them from trading?The whole point of Trump and Pence pushing the sunset clause was to kill the new trade deal. Canada had already rejected the idea that such a clause should be put into place during the many months of negotiation - it was a non-starter for the Canadians, because it would damage any chance of encouraging positive investment on either side of the border. US companies would be reluctant to invest in Canada, and Canadian companies would feel the same. Put bluntly: with a sunset clause, NAFTA wasn’t going to happen.This has been done for one reason, and one reason only: so Trump can appear ‘strong’ at the negotiating table. He can walk away and say “Look, we tried to negotiate with the Canadians, but they didn’t really want to deal”. He can continue to attack the Canadians and suggest that they engage in unfair trade practices, purely because they killed a deal in progress - he can project a false narrative of “The big bad Canadians wanted everything, but weren’t willing to deal”. The exact same nonsense that Trump spouted at the G7 summit.The sad reality is that Trump had no intention of creating a new trade deal, and certainly no intention of continuing NAFTA, even under new terms. He wants to have his cake and eat it: he inherently presumes that the Canadians will come crawling to the White House on bended knee for a trade deal, if he keeps being stubborn. They’ll be desperate, and he can choose terms that are favourable to him, and screw over Canada.The problem? The absence of an effective trade deal between the US and Canada is far more damaging to the United States. After all, who do you think is the primary importer of US goods? Let’s look at it by state, shall we?It’s not gonna be Canada who get screwed over here: if trade tightens up at the border, it’ll be US citizens who suffer, because the manufacturing industries will have lost their biggest customer.Trump and Pence are screwing around with the livelihoods of millions of Americans in the vain hope that Trudeau will crawl to the negotiating table and beg for scraps. He won’t: the Canadians are in a strong bargaining position, and have positive trade relations around the world. They’d undoubtedly suffer a little if there’s no effective trade between themselves and the US, but they’d recover.You know who won’t? The United States.So, everybody thank your President for pissing off your number one trading partner through his petty schoolyard bully tactics.

1,"What is the alternative to implementing tariffs on Chinese goods, or any country's goods, for that matter?",Tariffs,Foreign Policy,1!,1!,1!,1!,"The imposition of tariff against goods from any country is mainly to protect the domestic industry making the same good because the home manufacturer cannot compete openly without imposing a price penalty on the import. Indeed if you listen to Trump, that is what he is supposed to be doing on steel and aluminum when he levied tariff on virtually all import from anywhere else.The unintended consequence of such tariff is to impose penalty on the rest of the domestic economy. In the case of steel and aluminum, the auto industry has been a large buyer of imports. Now whether they buy from domestic supplier or the import, they will pay more for their starting raw material. Chances are they will pass this added cost to the consumer. The net effect is the US steel and aluminum industry gets to protect their employment roll and perhaps even add workers to their payroll, the car companies may have to lay off workers and the American consumer has less money in their pocket.The tariff barrier is called import substitution because it’s a device to keep a more competitive product from entering the domestic market and to prolong the life a less competitive domestic product subsidized by the domestic consumer. During the Reagan era, tariff was imposed on foreign made (specifically Japanese made) cars to keep the US market for the US car makers. It was supposed to be a wake up call for American car makers to get their act together and become competitive. Instead, the first thing the American car makers did was to raise their sticker price to match the imports but with the same crappy cars.The idea of free and open trade (with no unfair or hidden subsidy involved) is to let the most competitive product win in the market place. Everybody has to compete and nobody gets to hide behind a tariff wall.In my view, I don’t believe any country can win by using tariff to combat imports. It’s virtually impossible to levy tariff and not face retaliatory counter tariff. The outcome is always lose-lose.",128,3,391,289,0,0

President Trump’s approval rating is currently around what President Obama and President Reagan had in the same time period, and their parties both faced huge losses in the House. Furthermore, the generic Congressional ballot is also in line with those of historical elections where the majority party suffered heavy losses.Furthermore, while only 48 seats are rated as competitive right now, Republicans hold 41 of them (Reminder that Democrats need 24 seats to win the House), and in the 41 seats, 25 seats are in districts where Clinton outperformed President Trump in the 2016 election. Furthermore, six Republicans in tossup seats are not running for re-election, so Democrats will not have to face the incumbency advantage for those seats. Lastly, Democrats also seem to be unusually energetic this midterm season, as they have narrowed the gap or even outperformed Republicans (i.e. Conor Lamb) in special elections for what are usually safe Republican seats.",27,0,16,2,0,0

Violent video games in multiple studies have been shown to be a release not a causation of violent tendencies. It is very reasonable to assume nerf guns and similar toys would be as well. This is backed by anecdotal evidence. In the 20s through 50s every kid in the US had a toy gun. The murder rate except in the 30s was extremely low. Much lower than it is since such toys became taboo. Thus it is a reasonable conclusion that toy guns do not promote violence later in life. If they did we would have had massive murder rates during that time period. Instead murder rates were in decline as violence became more common in movies and toy guns more popular. Westerns in particular promoted toy gun usage and became very popular from the 30s on. Toy soldiers however were extremely popular from the birth of the nation into the 80s.

2,Why did Liviu Dragnea decide to change Romania's course from a democratic pro-Western state to an Orbanite illiberal one?,Liviu Dragnea,Romania,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,"I don’t think he changed the course of the country. Romania has always had a polarised political culture and political class. Even during the 19th century, political life in Romania was divided between those who wanted Romania to develop institutions that were more similar to Western ones and those who wanted things to develop according to local customs.At different points in history, one or the other political pole gained dominance and left its mark on Romania’s development. Considering how Romania looks like these days, you can deduce yourself which part of the political spectrum wielded power for a longer period of time.Romania will probably continue to vote for politicians like Dragnea as long as half of its population still lives in rural areas in impoverished conditions, as long as a big percentage of the population gets its income/pension from the state and as long as the smartest Romanians continue to leave the country or live abroad.Most elections in the post-Communist period in Romania have been motivated either by a passive bandwaggon effect (people just voting for the dominant party that promised them things will remain the same, just because most people were terrified of significant social and institutional changes) or by protest voting (people casting their vote as a form of punishment, in order to reject a party that took them for a ride for too long). Most Romanians become frustrated with a party once it becomes obvious they’re not doing anything but enriching themselves, without sharing the spoils, but are not bothered by corrupt leaders, if those leaders throw them some crumbs in the form of social handouts.This Liviu Dragnea guy understood what makes Romanians tick from a political point of view and he knows that as long as his party can deliver even some small pension and wage raises for the huge number of Romanians whose income depends on the state (pensioners, public servants, people living on welfare), he can do anything he wants with the justice system, with the media, with any other institution. Because most Romanians don’t care much about institutions, as much as they care about their small wage/pension raise, as long as their corrupt leaders throw them some crumbs from their spoils, it’s fine for them. Most Romanians are not ambitious and don’t have that sense of entrepreneurship and risk that made richer economies what they are today, they prefer having a more secure job and wage to a riskier job that brings the possibility of higher income.This goes hand in hand with Romanians’ undeveloped sense of property, because if they valued private enterprise and property more than having a low but secure and steady income, they would be less socially dependent on governmental policies and they would care more about the rule of law (since that would affect their businesses). Since they don’t see anything profitable for them in supporting a rule-of-law-based system, because that won’t increase their pensions/wages/welfare, they’d rather support leaders like Dragnea.",152,5,11,35,0,0

Note that Dragnea originally was the “baron-lord” of Teleorman county.To keep the support of the “local barons” he needs support of the people (they are the voting mass) who keep the “barons” strong and rich.Now the more educated self-sufficient crowd are less involved and less likely to be swayed by an extra 20 Euros on the state pension of for 10 Euros to go and demonstrate or to sell their votes for a bag of sugar and a loaf of bread. As such, the easiest way to get massive popular support is to induce fear of “all-things-foreign”, keep the masses poor, uneducated and dependent on their PSD overlords’ measly gifts.Plus the West is scary, with their uniform law system, and their smart, firm leaders and their hard-to-steal EU Funds.

What message does it send to Americans?,State of the Union Addresses,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"It really wasn’t until this latest SOTU address with President Trump that I really took offense to the way the two parties acted towards one another. To me, first I felt they were portraying a group of unprofessional and undignified children that had no control over their petty dislike of one another. It left me feeling ashamed that these were the supposed leaders of the country that I love. The way Nancy Pelosi acted not to mention the rest of them while issues were being addressed and discussed. The fact that they could not even muster the ability to get through the short time the same way they would have expected their children to get through Sundays church service. Sit down, pay attention and show respect to the speaker.I understand the immense hatred that President Trump has commanded from the Dems, but this was live TV… Everyone knows they do not care for him! I can only hope for their sake and the sake of every American citizen being represented that it was only being televised in our country and not world wide. God only knows how bad we look in the publics eye as it is.Prior to Trump being voted in, we had Obama. He tried, but I’m not so sure many men could do much better when having a gun pointed at your head for 4 years straight. The fact that he ran again was in my opinion a testament to the kind of man, Patriot and fool he was! Especially when in public, he is ostracized by the other party and promises were made to make sure nothing would ever get past the senate that he had begun. Politics is such a dirty business… The President is a puppet. He does what the power tells him to. Maybe that’s why everyone is so verbally against Trump. He refuses to play politics in the historically normal way.Now, I voted for Trump, bt quickly bought into the masses and their opinion of him after seeing and hearing some of his lies and the verbiage that had escaped from his lips. However, I am more and more ashamed that I too allowed myself to be swayed by the lies CNN and MSNBC so vehemently spew over the airwaves. News? Where? FOX, sure. The other two? Strictly opinion by self loathing, self proclaimed Political Analysts. Who exactly are these people that have the ear of damn near 70% of the American public? So, they spent 2 years in a Political Science Class and then got a job at their local Newspaper in the Opinion section and began spewing their own opinions that had absolutely no truth to them at all! From there, CNN or MSNBC offered them a $27,000.00 a year salary, a laptop, and 10 minutes a week on air arguing with other likeminded morons about how horrible everything is, but offer absolutely no alternative other than to impeach the current man in power. Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Bush, Obama and now the crème de la crème, Trump! While they constantly bitch, piss and moan about Trump, he is making these idiots careers! If not for him, they’d not a thing to say and never be on air! They ought to be kissing his ass, instead of badmouthing him!It’s funny. If you were to come to this country from a distant planet. Had no idea who we were, who Trump was and then looked at his accomplishments since his taking office, I’m curious as to what your opinion of him might well be? There is no denying what has taken place since he was elected.Let’s get one thing straight here. Before Trump, any other President took credit for anything good or bad regardless of whether he had his hand in it or not… It was the way things worked. True, Trump did not singlehandedly lower unemployment, cause record highs in the stock market, meet with Kim Jong-Un in an unprecedented summit to discuss ending N Koreas Nuclear Weapons Program, nor di he single handedly develop and offer on the open market the Trumpy Bear Teddy Bear, but all this and more took place while he was in office, therefore under the previously set rules, he is responsible for them!It’s ridiculous that because Trump is so hated among a few Americans, (let us not forget that he won the election for Pres which means a shitload of people actually do like him) no matter what good he does, he will always be met with the bad! To me, that is sad… It is childish, and it is not the way I want my Government to portray themselves!

I can’t remember the person’s name but I found his answer incredibly insightful in that it puts todays partisanship in a historical context.""plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose —""the more it changes, the more it's the same thing"", usually translated as ""the more things change, the more they stay the same,"" quote by Alphonse Karr from 1839Here is Washington’s spot on take on political parties.George Washington decried the creation of political parties in his farewell address after years of seeing Thomas Jefferson’s Democratic-Republican Party and Alexander Hamilton’s Federalist Party going at each other, with good reason:However [political parties] may now and then answer popular ends, they are likely in the course of time and things, to become potent engines, by which cunning, ambitious, and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people and to usurp for themselves the reins of government, destroying afterwards the very engines which have lifted them to unjust dominion.[Source]He predicted that individuals would use the power of political parties for personal gain, at the expense of democracy and popular sovereignty.Political parties are important for one thing: preserving the system from which it grew. Without political parties, elections would be unorganized, disinteresting, and unengaging—they’re one of those things that a democracy produces in order to sustain its own health, like Cabinets and Supreme Court justices (everything/anything out of the Supreme Court, really).Political parties encourage political participation in democracy, but they also undermine that democracy in the process by neglecting personal ideological diversity, tying each person down to a set of beliefs that may not align with his/her own.”",27,0,7,355,0,2

There are so many variables that we simply do not know; far more than is usually the case.The single biggest question is this: What, exactly, is Robert Mueller going to find and disclose?This is a sort of Rorschach Test - asking people what Mueller has found thus far. Virtually everyone is going to project based upon shadows - what questions he is asking, to whom he is issuing subpoenas. Thus far, not a single piece of actual evidence has been released by Mueller.I have tremendous respect for Mueller, and I think he is a deliberate, careful investigator. He has thus far been pretty scrupulous about keeping is cards out of view. As he should. The same cannot be said of the press, who are looking at every single action by the prosecutor and his team so that they can rush out screaming headlines. It surely cannot be said for the President, who tweets out non-sense like a seventh grade girl excluded from a birthday party.What Mueller finds is going to determine what happens in 2020. The Democrats are more or less all in on this, and Trump by the reality that he is at the centre, is as well.If Mueller finds little more than that Michael Cohen paid a porn start to be quiet, and that Trump’s team sought to encourage Russians to dig up dirt on Hillary Clinton, that is going to blow up in the face of the Democrats. On the other hand, if Trump’s team really collaborated with Russians to help them, if there was money laundering, then Trump is not going to even serve out his term.What is the common theme here?It does not matter - at all - whom the Democrats nominate in 2020, which is one of the “arguments” Romney makes (that they will pick a nominee out of the mainstream).If Trump is still in the White House in 2020, it means Mueller did not land a solid blow on Trump. I suspect that there is a chance that, under this scenario, there will be a significant backlash against the Democratic Party, as there was against the GOP for their stupid prosecution of Bill Clinton.If Trump is gone, then the Democrats can go wild and pick a nominee (and VP) that will allow them to pander to their core coalition. If I were a Democratic operative in 2020, I would push for the most liberal, activist nominee that I could. Perhaps go for someone like Kamala Harris, who ticks the black, female, left coast boxes.

2,Will Mitt Romney be correct in his prediction of Trump being reelected?,2020 U.S. Presidential Election,Mitt Romney (politician),1!,1!,1!,1!,"Mitt Romney said President Trump will win the Republication nomination and be reelected based on two things:A strong economy.The Democrats nominating “someone who is really out of the mainstream of American thought.”In my opinion, may be correct only if both of those are true. A strong economy alone will not ensure President Trump’s re-election. However, if the economy remains strong and Democrats nominate someone who is not perceived to be a moderate Democrat - someone who is strong on national defense, pro-business (or at lest not anti-business), and who advocates incremental changes in healthcare and education and not immediate, sweeping reforms - then President Trump will be re-elected.In other words, the Democrats won’t win with Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren or someone very similar.Let the infuriation begin.Pro-Sanders people can cite all the polls and surveys they want. Those who favor an immediate transition to a more “European style” mix of socialism and capitalism can argue the advantages all day long. At the end of the day, undecided voters in the swing states are primarily concerned with the current state of the economy and national security.If Democrats expect to unseat an incumbent President, many must emerge from their self-spun, confirmation-biased cocoon and realize that, though many U.S. voters support change and would prefer a President other than President Trump, they will not be won over by Trump-bashing and condescending dismissals of Republican policies.

3,"By meeting with Kim from North Korea, does this legitimize his dictatorship and empower him to further oppress his country?",Republican (political party),North Vs. South Korea,1!,1!,1!,1!,"As I have said before, North Korea is likely being used as a proxy by China to further their longer term goals of getting the US military to withdraw from Asia entirely.For years, North Korea has been the crazy attack dog on the Chinese border intended to scare off any would be invaders. Now that it has nuclear weapons that is the bait to force the US to start to withdraw if they agree to “denuclearize”. In this way, China is able to use the US’s own words and policies to force it to do something that is very much in China’s interest and will be very detrimental to the US in the long run.Why do you think Kim was so eager to have this meeting after Trump cancelled it?Why do you think he went to China first to meet with Xi?Who is likely to be the main source of benefits for Kim if he denuclearizes? Hint: not the U.S.Eventually, if NK does denuclearize (as seems likely) Kim is likely to transform his government into something more closely resembling Singapore or even China itself. After that he, or his successor ,will likely seek reunification with South Korea. And North Korea, and eventually a united Korea, will find themselves showered with financial benefits from China, as will many other Asian countries, in order to get them on board with total US military withdrawal from the region.The past oppression of the North Korean people by Kim’s family will quickly be forgotten if he begins a process of modernizing Korea and making them prosperous like their brothers and sisters to the south.And meeting with Kim was a foregone conclusion as long as he kept extending an olive branch in the form of denuclearization negotiations with the US.Trump had no choice but to meet with him under those circumstances. He had been boxed into a corner where if he said “no” he looked like the “bad guy” who refused to negotiate even when “peace” was being offered.Take for example what happened when John Kerry said that the US would not attack Syria if they got rid of their chemical weapons and allowed inspectors in to verify it. The Russians pounced on that statement and persuaded Assad to hold Kerry to his word by claiming to have destroyed his chemical weapons and allowing outside inspectors in to verify it.Likewise, the Chinese have used Trump’s insistence on denuclearization of Korea to force him into a position where he has to keep his word, and force the US to pay a heavy price for keeping that word, or look like even more of an untrustworthy fool on the world stage than he does now.",166,3,1.1k,"1,703",0,0
3,"By meeting with Kim from North Korea, does this legitimize his dictatorship and empower him to further oppress his country?",Republican (political party),North Vs. South Korea,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Kim’s regime has weathered a serious storm this time around, perhaps the worst in North Korea’s history. There is little doubt that the draconian sanctions took a toll. Kim tried every terror tactic in his arsenal trying to force the world to appease him, and like the Aesop story of the wind trying to force a man to take off his coat, all he ended up with this time was a more resolute world and a completely destroyed test site. Trump may sound a bit full of himself over this, but he is not wrong. He played it all the way to the brink, and even got China at least partially involved in limiting access to cash and goods to the DPRK. That is unprecedented.It is clear that North Korea already is a dictatorship, and an oppressive regime. They have never had “legitimacy” nor do they have it now. The burden is on Kim to begin to bring reforms to his ravaged nation.What Trump has done is to bring the North Koreans to the table with carrot and stick both there in plain site. Not only does it not cost America anything to suspend war games with South Korea as a gesture of good will toward North Korea, as he has said, it will save us millions of dollars. It is an immediate “peace dividend” and answers one of the biggest justifications North Korea has made for developing its nuclear attack capability. In the long run, Kim has to produce his own good faith show of compliance with the agreement, and dismantle his nuclear arsenal. After a trading of insults and much posturing, Trump has gone the other direction, being conciliatory, even complimentary. That can change fast if North Korea reneges. In fact, the rather shocking show after the G7 meeting demonstrates how fast Trump can change everything when he perceives that his position has been undermined by someone who had left a table of talks in good faith. Trump is crazy like a fox. Underrated, he seems to be able to ride the waves of criticism like a surfer takes on the north shore of Oahu. Will he wipe out or win the championship? One thing is true, the only ones who have a chance actually mount a board. He has done so.There are many things that can be worked out in the future. We should recall how fast after glasnost and perestroika that the Berlin wall came down, and soon after, the Germanys were reunited. The prospect of a treaty ending the war between North and South will allow more freedom of relationship, trade, and investment, which has the power to see the hermit kingdom come out of the cave into the sunlight for the first time. It is ironic that the children of the people who once sang “Give Peace a Chance” are the very ones seemingly wishing to leave the Korean status quo in the same condition it has been in for these 64 years.There are really only three alternatives.Leave things the way they are, festering. This has proved to be a very dangerous state. North Korea continues to not only develop weapons under this scenario, but becomes an exporter of WMD and very dangerous materials to terrorist countries around the globe in order to bring in money as well as spark alliances with people who also are feeling hostility toward the West.Attempt to overthrow the Kim regime in some way. This condition creates at least a massive potential for destruction of both Koreas, Japan, parts of China, Russia, with environmental damage for all the nations of East Asia, as well as a spillover effect for the rest of the world. Actions here could even be the spark that begins to bring other players to the fore. In the worst possible scenario, this could be World War III.Sit down and work out the difficulties, and improve relations of all involved. This one is not without risk as well, but it is minimal. The worst case scenario is that the whole thing could fall apart. If it fails due to actions by the Kim regime, China will have a difficult job in supporting his regime further. Kim no doubt will not want to give up his position in his lifetime, so the only choices are either a form of detente with two Koreas growing closer or some kind of revolution or reform in the North to make eventual unification possible.It had to start somewhere. If the relationship between the U.S. and Cuba finally heals completely and the island sees more freedom than it has had, Obama will always be seen as having accomplished something positive. It will be the same with Trump and Korea. No matter who we like today, that is how history will be likely to see things.",394,9,668,"4,241",0,0

1,What would the media coverage look like if the Trump-Kim summit was a Clinton-Kim summit instead?,2018 North Korea-US Summit,Kim Jong-un,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Question: What would the media coverage look like if the Trump-Kim summit was a Clinton-Kim summit instead?Donald Trump is very good at focussing the attention on himself and the media coverage reflects that. It was a tremendous photo-op and Trump claims 100% of the credit for everything, starting with the pacifist South Korean president’s invitation to Kim to send an Olympic team to Seoul and the strong efforts he has made at rapprochement. Kim is interested in making North Korea economically strong and militarily safe. His father and grandfather were willing to sacrifice the well-being of the people of North Korea to maintain a hostile stance toward South Korea and the world at large. President Moon Jae-In deserves huge credit for his massaging of egos. Donald Trump made a big splash and the media loves that splash.I do not think the press coverage would have been as great were it to be a Clinton-Kim summit. She is more knowledgeable and would have been much more prepared. Consider what she would have known and weighed.North Korean presidents have requested one-on-one meetings with the U.S. president before. It both enhances their status and serves as a wedge between the U.S. and other involved parties;North Korea (NK) announced the decision to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in the early 1990’s. In 1994, NK and the U.S. negotiated an agreement to place a hiatus on that withdrawal in exchange for two light-water reactors that could not make material for nuclear weapons and other energy support. That agreement was cancelled in 2002 when both sides said the other was not in compliance;The six-party (North and South Korea, China, Russia, Japan and the U.S.) talks held previously reached a stronger agreement that the current Singapore announcement about denuclearization. That agreement slowed NK’s nuclear development from 2003–2009 when NK dropped out;The agreement as given says nothing about verification. In Reagan’s terms, “trust but verify.” In negotiating terminology, “complete, irreversible, and verifiable dismantlement.”Trump said nothing about other issues such as human rights or NK’s militaristic actions in the region. (You may recall the furor raised by some Republicans when Obama reached an agreement with Cuba that did not include decisions made about human rights). This is the very arrow thrown at the Iran nuclear deal, that it has done nothing to limit Iran’s activities in the region. The counter may be made that NK refused to have put all of that on the table and that is undoubtedly true. The nuclear ballistic capability is our primary concern and other issues can follow later. That is exactly the argument made for the Iran nuclear agreement that was trashed by Trump (such as, “If Iran agrees to stop certain activities, that should be exchanged for allowing them to have more centrifuges — not a good deal for the world);Clinton would not so readily make a concession that throws South Korea under the bus: no mutual readiness exercises (“war games”) with the South Koreas and the U.S. military. There seems to be no recognition that a million NK troops are in readiness just north of the 38th parallel and that NK has said that their capacity for biological and chemical weapons was not on the table for discussion.So there would be absolutely no big media splash for Clinton to equal Trump’s. Such agreements take time, attention to detail (the devil is in the details) and continued pressure, both economic sanctions and military readiness.There is a lot of glitter now. All the presents are wrapped and under the tree. We should wait until those packages are unwrapped before we celebrate. If NK verifiably ends its hostile actions, I will rejoice and laud the agreement and those responsible; I have friends in Seoul who will rejoice with me.",113,0,216,198,0,0

Gerrymandering is nothing more than a part of the constitutionally mandated redrawing (redistricting) of congressional districts of representation within a state.When the population of a state grows or loses to much, it will call for an increase or decrease of the number of House of Representative seats it can have in congress. When a state gains or loses a representative, the district boundaries within that state must be changed to accommodate the correct number of allotted representatives. Redistricting is the process used to make the required district changes. Redistricting occurs every ten years in concurrence with the national U.S. Census.Gerrymandering has been used by whichever political party is in control of the state that has a required change in the number of representatives it can have. When redrawing the district lines, the party in control will try to draw the lines to protect an incumbent, or to redistribute the voting strength of their within the redrawn districts in a way that would be more apt to favor them gaining an increased number of representatives.The United States is a representative democracy.

2,Do you think that the Democratic Party should include and respect pro-life liberal voters more?,Liberal Democrats (UK politics),Liberalism (politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"I think the party needs to examine this much more closely: we’re here on Quora making up answers about how the party should deal with those beliefs, and I really like a lot of these answers, but if you’re not a politics-nerd, and if you are someone who believes in providing health care for every American, protecting the environment for the next generation, not engaging in wars lightly and with a cocky attitude about how easy they will be, etc etc and also that life begins at conception, the Democrats haven’t noticed you.They’ll argue about whether you’re allowed in: at what point does a set of views encroach on women’s rights enough that they don’t like you anymore, that you don’t count as ok.*They’ll sort-of listen to your policy needs, the Democrats are good at the actual work of policy: they’re actually serious about that very poorly framed phrase “safe, legal and rare.” Voting for Democrats doesn’t mean more abortions. Around the world, the liberal approach of sex ed, universal education and health care, and support for parents struggling economically all add up to more success at lowering abortion rates than the restrict-and-punish policies that come from the right.What the Democrats don’t do is (1) listen and invite and (2) stick to their frame.A pro-life person can, in reality, get more done to lower abortion rates within the Democratic party than the GOP (make it illegal, create an immediate backlash). But they’re not actually invited to. I think this is tricky: liberals have heard wildly insincere calls to protect fetuses by “Pro-Life” politicians who so clearly don’t give a small damn, and for so long, politicians who would turn on a dime if the winds of politics changed, that they don’t recognizeIt’s very similar to how the Democrats have pushed economic policy that they believe is best for the country, and aimed to creat support and retraining policies for workers displaced by a changing world and by their policies, without coming across as if they are talking with and listening to people who are watching their way of life disappear — in politics you can’t just study them and hand them an effective policy. Many of those voters felt like Trump was listening to them, and in many ways he was paying more attention…. how did they feel, what is life like, that’s not policy, but if you’re listening to someone you’ll know.Democrats need to create a dialogue around pregnancy, choice and women’s empowerment that is much more vibrant than “safe, legal and rare.” That expresses their own beliefs that are “pro-life” (including post-birth) not as a counter to Pro-Life movement, but just state you’re own beliefs with clarity. And that accepts, much more openly, that there are many good people who believe that life begins before birth, and many ways that those beliefs can be acted on that don’t involve being invasive, a subset by government, and invite people to come do that work together. Make it an invitation.For example: The more the government pushes its way into that private decision, the less mental-space people have to check with their own faith. To the extent that government attempts to force the issue, people get angry and defensive, and won’t be open to hearing the message from religious or moral leaders and actually being convinced. The Democrats can say that. They can say that they want to create a world that is more pro-life overall, where we all value each other, and that the best thing the government can do is let people think about their own bodies and their own pregnancies from a place without fear — having that child will not mean a life of poverty, will not mean your child doesn’t get a good education unless you wait till you’re wealthier, etc. They can openly invite people who disagree on this one policy to be part of the conversation and vote with them on every other issue where they agree.###*Also: They don’t maintain a separate set of approaches for politicians (who do have power over women’s body as they enact laws) and voters. The tent, on many issues, needs to be bigger for voters, and then we come together and create a consensus of what the party will do together.",93,0,131,834,0,0

They acted as a support group for expecting mothers, putting together care packages, taking care of transportation, scheduling (and childcare - a lot of the women they helped wanted to have their second kid and just didn’t have enough hours in the day any more), and generally supporting both the institution and the practical reality of motherhood.These women were overwhelmingly poor, single and at the end of their rope. The student group decided to donate their time, their money, and their love to making sure that these would-be mothers got through an incredibly tough time with their life and sanity intact.They were the sort of people who looked at the movie Juno and said not “see? Everyone can do it and everyone should and there’s something wrong with them if they don’t,” but said instead “wow, what if everybody had that level of amazing support network?”They were, in a word, pro-life.Later, when I became politically active, I was baffled why this wasn’t the Republican position. Aren’t we practical? Overturning Roe vs. Wade just wasn’t on the cards, wasn’t it more sensible to do what good we could with our own two hands? Don’t we want the government out of our lives? Why on earth do we want the coercive power of the State telling us what to do with our pregnancies? Isn’t that the most fundamental invasion possible?It was a point of confusion for a good while, until I discovered that the methods of the pro-life student group were in line with the Democratic position. The centrist Democratic position, to be sure, but “support mothers to reduce the demand for abortions while edging out abortion providers by not providing them federal funds” is, in fact, the politics of the likes of Tim Kaine.The Democratic Party already includes and respects pro-lifers, if by pro-lifers you mean people who want to reduce abortions by providing support to mothers so they no longer feel they need abortions (and sex-ed to women who don’t want to be mothers).God, do they suck at selling it, though.

There are several problems with their assertions:Pro-life areas have higher abortion rates (and higher death rates) than pro-choice areas, since pro-lifers have chosen, in action, to be against sexual education, contraception, and protection for women women before or after they’re abused… thus robbing them of the opportunity to avoid unwanted pregnancies in the first place. In terms of ending abortion, pro-choice policies have been much more successful.Pro-life people, in for whom and on what they vote, demonstrate a disdain for the living. As soon as a woman is forced to give birth against her will, as often as not, both the mother AND the child get slandered as parasites or moochers to be abandoned and attacked. Add to this voting against education and equal rights, which then render those childrens’ lives significantly worse and more likely to result in taking up crime or getting pregnant with yet more unwanted/too-soon/economically unviable pregnancies, to further repeat the process and ruin more lives, cyclically.Democrats have absolutely no reason to ‘respect’ this disastrous approach to a difficult issue.",113,5,74,941,0,0
2,Do you think that the Democratic Party should include and respect pro-life liberal voters more?,Liberal Democrats (UK politics),Liberalism (politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"Yes.The question of where life begins is a question of ontology and depending on where you define that, the answer will likely inform your views on abortion.Because such a definition is arbitrary, a pro life positon that believes life begins at conception is no less valid than a pro choice belief that disagrees.I don't think liberals appropriately convey these nuances in their arguments (and vice versa to be fair) and usually just retort that, “it's a woman's choice”. However, this fails to address the ontological status debate and probably does so because such a debate has no objective winner.The unfortunate consequence of this is that pro life people view the pro choice position as inhumane bordering on sociopathic.In general, American politics has a very polarized and simplified (due to the heated talking points) discourse on the subject.Not all pro life people just want to control womens' bodies. Some are focused on the “right to life” as enshrined in our founding documents and the humanity of a fetus. I don't see those as bad people.Democrats need to be more sympathetic to this position and address it properly by having a detailed discussion over ontological status; laying out their opinion on where they define life beginning (which may be when sentience develops later in the pregnancy).I want to take this opportunity to bring up an idea I think would greatly serve the world and give something to both pro life and pro choice people. I think most would rather see less abortion, and more proactive birth control. Government should provide and encourage every teenager of sexual mature age to take birth control. I believe the single greatest underlying problem in humanity is overpopulation. It leads to over consumption and depletion of resources and the environment. It leads to poverty. It leads to more crime and warfare. Societal stress overall and the increased stress and competition between individuals. Unwanted pregnancy is correlated with crime, poverty, less education, mental illness, malnourishment, and other issues in society. Nazi Germany used eugenics. China enforced a one child policy. These were unethical, but we now have a humane solution because we now have the technology to empower the individual. If we can temper hormonal teenagers, we can give them the ability to grow up a bit, mature a little, become more responsible, seek an education and career, follow their dreams, and then, when they are ready, have WANTED children they can care for.I would like to shift the focus off of the abortion topic, and start talking about the proactive solution we've had for years now.",61,0,6,130,0,0

1,Democrats blew the 2016 election. What was the reason and will it mean they will lose again in 2020?,2020 U.S. Presidential Election,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"There are many ways to interpret why the 2016 election turned out as it did.Besides the Democrats blowing the election, I’ll point out a few reasons why they did not have as much control over the outcome as many believe.1- The Republicans decades long smearing campaign against the Clintons succeeded in poisoning the opinions of voters from all political parties. This resulted in a visceral and imbalanced view against Hillary Clinton. So this negativity yielded voters’ apathy against Hillary Clinton.2- Vladimir Putin despised Hillary Clinton due to her opposition and hard stance against his regime. Putin saw Trump as a kindred spirit who shared many of his moral and political ideologies. So Putin decided to help Donald Trump out by waging a smear campaign against Hillary Clinton which undoubtedly contributed to the marginal swing that gave Trump the electoral votes.3- Many Republicans and far right voters despised Obama no matter what good he did as a President. So hatred, much of which is based on Obama’s race as opposed to achievement, qualification and character led to a “screw you! It’s our turn.” racist vote that planted the least qualified candidate simply because he was white and male. Many of such voter will never express this sentiment in public. But when they look in the mirror, they know who they are.4- Many Republicans and far right voters including women in that group would only identify with a male presidential candidate. So they were sexist; and would have never voted HRC into office. Such group would use hyperbole and excuses based on the over exaggerated smear campaign against her by their Republican base to justify their bigotry against the more qualified candidate in HRC. So their reasons went beyond political affiliation.5- Many Republicans who were not necessarily racist, were genuinely duped by Trump based on his message and their own misconception that because Trump was a Billionaire executive, he would have the presidential leadership qualities to bring the positive changes that effected their lives economically.6- Enough of Bernie Sanders’ supporters adopted the same hatred embraced by the Republicans against Hillary Clinton and the Democratic party. And they expressed such tunnel visioned disdain at the voting booth during the Presidential election by either voting for Sanders, not voting, or voting for Trump.7- Enough Democrats were sold on the exaggerated smear campaign against Hillary Clinton while ignoring in balance that Trump was a hundred folds worst despite her documented errors. This caused voter apathy leading many to not vote and/or convinced themselves that Trump was worth a shot. Additionally, some Democrats may have been more sexist than they led on given their own unjustifiable disdain towards Hillary Clinton.8- Enough American voters plainly fooled themselves in assuming that change is worth the risk of sabotage over qualification. So the rest of the more insightful American voters who based their votes on education and research have to share the burden of their choice.Once these eight points are acknowledged, it’s difficult to accept the narrative that Democrats blew the 2016 election.",292,10,86,212,0,0
1,Democrats blew the 2016 election. What was the reason and will it mean they will lose again in 2020?,2020 U.S. Presidential Election,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"First, let’s take a look at what Democrats do when they win elections.The three examples I select are 2006, 2008 and 2012.In all three of those years, not only did they have a clear and resonant message. They also had a presidential nominee in Barack Obama who had a clear philosophical point of view and who also was a high-enthusiasm high-turnout low-negatives candidate.On the other hand, in 2016, they nominated Hillary Clinton, a low-enthusiasm low-turnout high-negatives presidential candidate; and they got their clocks cleaned.If the Republican party needs to win, they need to appeal to the center and to independents. That is because their core constituency is smaller than that of Democrats. They therefore need to reach out and appeal to people who don’t normally vote Republican or they simply don’t receive the votes they need to win.On the other hand, the Democratic party’s need for victory lies in energizing and enthusing their base. The reasons for that are two-fold:First, there are more of them than there are of Republican base voters.Second, the Democratic party’s base constituencies normally do not vote in as high percentages as do the Republican party’s base constituencies. Republicans almost never need to worry about their base voters turning out, which means they can concentrate on bringing unlikely voters into the Republican fold. On the other hand, the first strategic need of a Democratic candidate is to get that candidate’s base to turn out.This is a fundamental difference between the two parties. When Democratic strategists get confused, and think they’re working for the Republican party, they take the base for granted, reach out to voters who are not natural fits for the Democratic party, and nominate losers like Hillary Clinton.When Democratic strategists are not confused, and recognize they are working for the Democratic party, they nominate a candidate the base likes, like Barack Obama, they reach out to, and inspire, their base voters, and place a lower priority on recruiting moderates, centrists and independents than they do on inspiring and turning out their base.Both parties, of course, need to do both. The difference is that the base vote is the highest priority for Democrats; the unlikely voter is the highest priority for Republicans.More broadly, therefore, it was not the Republicans who won the 2016 election. It was Democrats who lost it.A quick look at the 2016 numbers demonstrates that incontrovertibly.Line up Obama’s 2012 state-by-state numbers.Now line up Clinton’s 2016 state-by-state numbers.Here’s what you notice right away, and it sticks out like a sore thumb.Hillary Clinton received EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND fewer votes in the critical Midwest heartland swing states of Iowa, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin than did Barack Obama in 2012. And keep in mind that Obama’s 12 performance, while respectable, did not equal his boffo performance in 08; so the 12 results actually represent a minimally acceptable support level, or floor, for Democrats. Most any competent viable Democratic candidate should have been able to receive a roughly equivalent total in 2016.Moreover Trump’s numbers confirm this point; he did not do that much better than Romney. In fact, the only important swing states where Trump did better than Obama were Florida, North Carolina and Ohio. And Trump actually received fewer votes in Arizona than Obama did in 2012, even though Trump won that state. In other words, a reasonably competent Democratic presidential candidate should not only have been able to win Iowa, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin but also Arizona, which would have given that reasonably competent Dem the presidency, in spite of the loss of the three swing states which Trump did indeed win, fair and square, namely FL, NC and OH.Yes, but what was the reason why Dems lost 2016? Why was Hillary a low-enthusiasm low-turnout high-negatives candidate? Why did she drag the party down to defeat?Unfortunately we don’t know the answer for sure. The only way to answer that question definitively is to poll the eight hundred thousand voters in the four heartland swing states who voted for Obama in 12 but walked out on Clinton in 16. And, to the best of my knowledge, no one has yet done that. And, with each passing month, the accuracy and usefulness of such a poll, were it to be conducted, steadily dwindles in value, unfortunately, because memories fade and minds change.However, absent that, one can hazard an intelligent guess as to the answer, based on one’s own knowledge and experience.Using that as a guide, here’s why I think the Dems lost with Hillary Clinton at the top of their ticket.Clinton was an establishment pro-Wall Street hawkish candidate in a political year that was anti-establishment, anti-Wall Street and war-weary. This, in part, helps to explain her high negatives. There were, of course, other reasons for those high negatives: her unorthodox, at best, criminal, at worst, use of a private email server, her acceptance of enormous sums for private speeches the transcripts of which she has yet to divulge, her usual insistence on never admitting to making a mistake or doing something wrong (an unattractive trait she shares with her odious vanquisher, Trump), her graceless and arrogant characterization of her opponent’s supporters as “deplorable” and “irredeemable,” etc. etc. There were lots of nasty ingredients that went into that particularly noisome stew.The bottom line, however, is that, while she was faced with a high-negatives candidate in the person of Trump, her own high negatives effectively erased any natural advantage she might have had over Trump in that regard. And that deficit, more than anything, I believe, accounts for the Dems’ 2016 debacle.Now, the second half of the question: If that was the reason they lost, does this mean that the Dems will lose again in 2020?I blow hot and cold on that. Sometimes the idea that a political party can pull one of the great all-time boners in history and not recognize and correct their screw-up in the next election strikes me as reassuringly far-fetched. But then the fact that they were abjectly stupid enough, and idiotic enough, to pull such a boner in the first place gives me pause: Are people who are that stupid and idiotic really capable of recognizing, understanding, and correcting that mistake?The truth is we don’t know, yet. However, in light of the fact that so far the potential Democratic presidential candidates are playing it safe and keeping a low profile, my tentative conclusion is that they still don’t know their ass from a hole in the ground, and still don’t understand why they lost or how to prevent that from happening again. You see, playing it safe, as the current potential Dem prezzies appear to be doing, makes all the sense in the world if you have something of value you want to protect. But the Democrats have now lost everything: the White House, the Congress, the courts, the governorships, the state legislatures, everything. There ain’t nothin’ left to protect. So playing it safe no longer makes sense: Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose.Have the Democrats recognized this yet? Clearly no. Will they recognize this? So far, the signs are not promising.",6.1k,64,13,64,0,0
1,Democrats blew the 2016 election. What was the reason and will it mean they will lose again in 2020?,2020 U.S. Presidential Election,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"The Democrats lost in 2016 mainly because of the eight years prior; in many ways, electing Hillary Clinton would have been Obama term 3 & 4.Politics is local.Although the Democrats still claim that more people benefited from Obamacare/ACA than were harmed, the reality is that millions of people who had good insurance had their policies canceled and re-issued at triple the cost of the old plan and with greater out of pocket costs. Millions of people who had had insurance through their employer had new policies with premiums higher than their rent or mortgage and were priced out of the market; although Obama and Pelosi had promised them that “most of the middle class would save $2500 per year” or qualify for subsidies on the marketplace, the reality was that if that new premium weren’t 9.5% of their annual income, they didn’t qualify for subsidies and lost their insurance completely through an inability to pay the premium. Many in working class towns lost not only the Doctor they loved and felt comfortable with, but also the hospital that was closed down to the costs of the ACA. The reality is that most of those who benefited from the marketplace and subsidies or free insurance, were already qualified for Medicaid but had never bothered to apply and enroll.This reality hits people in their home. It wasn’t something that others experienced and they only heard about. And it meant that people were going to make a choice for the President based upon that experience.People were ready for something new…not a repeat of Bush vs Clinton ‘90’s style.Russia attempted to influence the election this time, just as its done every time and in countries all over the world. Despite their articles pointing out what appeared to be Hillary’s ill health, there was a video of her fainting and being loaded into a car that wasn't an edited video. There were videos of her coughing uncontrollably during speeches and interviews. These were real and didn’t need Russia’s meddling to influence voters minds.Her hatred and dislike of the everyday American didn’t need pushing by Russia either. She made the “basket of deplorable” comment just as she made the “I could have stayed home and baked cookies” statement years ago. These types of things are not endearing to those who might be thinking about casting a vote her way but are not certain yet. And her comments since, things like the women who didn’t vote for her did so because of their husbands or their fathers, do nothing but illuminate the hatred she feels deep down for anyone who doesn’t support her or her party.Then add in the “the rules are for thee and not for me” attitude made apparent by her flouting the Obama Administration rule about email accounts (for which she fired one or more of her state department employees for flouting) and you have a populace that is hesitant to vote for this person.Those who claim that the GOP “cheated”using the electoral college need to remember that Hillary didn’t bother to campaign at all in states she thought would always vote for the Democrat because they had always done so before. She left the door wide open for the GOP to speak to those who had felt the affects of the previous administration’s policies locally….and were ignored by the party they had been loyal to for years.",213,4,28,69,0,0

And they did.Finally, the electoral college resulted in yet another Republican president that did not win the popular vote. That too can be attributed to Democrats in Congress being asleep while Republicans used gerrymandering to draw districts around older, white populations.

The foreign intervention happened — and specifically helped Trump win the electoral college math.This is why the electoral college (in it’s current form) is a huge risk to our Republic — because it’s relatively easy to geo-hack electoral college votes with ‘fake-news’ (like the Pope endorsing Trump and Pizzagate).This is also why there’s a major effort to change how the electoral college math works:This effort doesn’t require a constitutional amendment.Has major bi-partisan support.Is about 64% complete.It’s called the National Popular Vote — interstate compact:The National Popular Vote interstate compact would guarantee the Presidency to the candidate who receives the most popular votes in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.The National Popular Vote bill has been enacted by 12 jurisdictions possessing 172 electoral votes, including four small jurisdictions (RI, VT, HI, DC), four medium- size states (CT, MD, MA, WA), and four big states (NJ, IL, NY, CA). The bill has passed a total of 36 legislative chambers in 23 states—most recently by a 21-14 vote in the Connecticut Senate, a 40–16 vote in the Arizona House, a 28–18 vote in the Oklahoma Senate, a 57–4 vote in New York Senate, a 37–21 vote in Oregon House, and a 26-16 vote in the New Mexico Senate. A total of 3,112 state legislators have either sponsored or cast a recorded vote for the bill.Obviously, this needs the support of a majority (270 out of 538) of electoral college votes — but the momentum appears to be on track to correct the current flaw in time for the 2020 Presidential election. It currently has 172 electoral votes — so it’s about 64% of the way — and activity at the state level suggests more states will follow soon.Assuming this electoral college flaw is fixed — the next President will (correctly) be decided by the popular vote — and there is no need for a “Constitutional Amendment” to apply this fix.",2.9k,61,8k,"2,276",1,1

1,"Do democrats running for mid-term elections need a different message than ""beat Trump""?",2018 Midterm Elections in the United States,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Yes they do.In rough terms, independent voters are roughly mid 40% of us. The other two parties are in the high 20% of us, maybe low 30 percent, give or take.Put another way, independent voters are nearly half of us. Secondly they trend young, under 40.The party strategy for the last few decades has essentially been to be better than the GOP, strong on social issues, and moderate to right-leaning on economic issues.Secondly, the core of that strategy has been to take large donations, to win elections, and to be more big business-friendly. This did win a lot of elections for many years. And it also brought us very significant and appreciated social progress as well.The economic cost of the strategy has been severe. Today, a majority of Americans are in economic distress. Many are struggling, many are in real trouble. There have been few meaningful gains for most Americans throughout this time when their cost and risk exposure has grown dramatically.In my view, this is economic failure.And the product of all that, is a party down over a thousand seats today struggling for relevance in government.In general, this strategy is a vote against type strategy, with the public good being an implied artifact of just being better than the worst. And I'm writing that from the left point of view, with the real intent of cultivating a more effective opposition party, which is needed in American politics today.I do not blame the right for doing what they're doing. They have an economic vision, they are fairly unified on that, and they have been effective in taking it to the American people.Democrats have not been as effective, nor unified on policy visions to compete with those presented by the right. They are not an effective economic opposition party at present.In my view, the left needs to make a choice. Either it's going to be an effective opposition party economically, or it's not. If it's not, I don't really see how Democrats come back into power, nor how our system of checks and balances will work toward a more equitable policy.And right there is the basis for a better economic strategy and policy vision.Flat out, the current economic policy is leaving a majority of Americans in real trouble. That is completely unacceptable, and it will do us all harm in the end. We cannot realistically compete as a nation with this great struggle and pain going on. We must make it better for everyone, or we're all going to be impacted.Progressives are generally responding to this with vote for type politics.Rather than trust a greater common public good will happen because Dems claim to be better than the GOP, progressives are making explicit statements and goals and visions to that end. People have reason to vote for, not just sucks less, or better than the GOP, not Trump, however they may see it.Overall participation in the Democratic process is low in the United States in many places. Progressives see the trend toward independent voters, the frustration with Party politics, and all of that leading to far too many people just checking out, failing to believe, failing to participate, and out of all that realize that people need something to vote for. Something explicit to get behind, be about, work hard for.Progressives believe, and are working to reform the party toward, strong commits on top issues, bolstered with very good ideas:Medicare for all.Living wages.Free college / student debt.Many progressives, particularly those that trend younger, are not Democrats today. They are not Democrats, because they cannot connect a brighter future to the Party politics, and that Democratic vote reliably. They see the failure and are not interested in more of the same politics that got us here.Additionally, many of these people have few options. They are entering the political process seeking better representation and Democrats should welcome them, work with them, not against, or at them.I am particularly concerned about blame and shame, and to some degree fear, being used in some lame attempt to push these people away or pressure them to get on board with failed economic policy.These things are not productive and are actually harmful. The party risk of further marginalization is very real, consequences painful, grim.Truth is people fear not being able to see a doctor. They experience shame in not being able to afford a modest home, or feed their kids, and many blame the parties and money in politics for those realities.Which brings me back to that choice. The left needs to choose whether it's going to be a strong economic and social left opposition party, or something else.The same basic party strategy and approach over the last 30 to 40 years isn't good enough.Put simply, Democrats need to be about the economic issues impacting a majority of Americans or run the very real risk of further marginalization.Progressives are leading the way with strong ideas well aligned to the need and pain out there and positive vote for politics people can get behind. It is also very important for all Democrats to understand progressives are not asking. Tried that for many years with no real impact.This Democrat welcomes these efforts.

1,"Do democrats running for mid-term elections need a different message than ""beat Trump""?",2018 Midterm Elections in the United States,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"“Do democrats running for mid-term elections need a difference message than ""beat Trump""?”Well, they do have Trump going for them, but that’s a lazy message that’s only really suitable in districts that are safe for Democrats anyway. It can be a marginal factor in close districts, but there aren’t enough of them to win back a majority.Regaining old seats and capturing new ones usually requires more effort than that. Not always. The Republican Party’s big racist/bigot/authoritarian-religious contingent would have accepted almost any rationale to vote against Obama, for example.Even there, notice that Hunt isn’t entirely honest. The Republican message was: “Let's beat President Barack Obama and get rid of Obamacare.” It was not, “Let’s beat Obama.”In doing that, the Republicans took hostility to Obama as a base and added a highly-energized, marginal, single-issue grievance.On the other hand, one of the advantages to having a do-nothing president is that there’s not a single-issue grievance that picks up a highly energized marginal vote.The current Democratic Party coalition does have small-but-vocal fringe groups like Antifa, that will automatically vote against Trump. Unfortunately, they won’t automatically vote for a Democrat, instead.As Karl Rove disparagingly said, we’re the reality-based community. Democrats are less likely to vote for style over substance. So, if we hear a sizzle, we expect to find some steak.The Republicans have obliged by continuing to attack Social Security and Medicare, as well as, both Medicaid, unemployment insurance, and welfare. Their current buzz phrase is “automatic spending,” but that includes all countercyclical policy since FDR. We already know that system doesn’t work and why (massive increase in economic volatility that predominantly harms the poor, women, children and elderly), so on some level it’s a gimme.Likewise, the Republicans continue to damage public education and the environment. Some of them are still running negatively on healthcare. On the first two, they’re opposed by about 70% of the public. On healthcare, their latest ideas were opposed by 88% of the public. They’re opposed on background checks by 97% of the public.Regardless, it’s a potential smorgasbord for Democrats, but having positioned themselves as Republican-lite since Bill Clinton, they seem to have forgotten how to win on dinner table economic issues.In my view, the Democrats spent far too much time saying that Donald Trump is a bad, bad man in 2016 and far, far too much time talking about abortion rights in the last three elections rather than talking about issues that matter to people.However, while I don’t think Hunt is being honest, I don’t agree with Amy Klobuchar either. Over the next few months, the Democrats need to craft a simple, crisp, short, clear message and/or messages. The message doesn’t have to be the same in every district, but it does need to make it clear that people are voting for Democrats either for something or against something that will attract marginal voters.Thanks for asking, Jonathan Brill .",185,6,372,"1,160",0,0

Could corporate culture business in America embrace and forward a relatively democratic method, to give people more security collectively and individually at their jobs?”Let’s digest this question in two pieces. What is the conservative’s view on worker cooperatives? Great for lazy workers, not so good for those who work hard.We already have a semblance of worker cooperatives in the public school system and in federal government employment. In these two sectors there is very little difference between those who work hard and those who hardly work. Both groups are paid the same and advance according to length of employment. Just as it’s almost impossible to fire an incompetent federal worker or teacher it is also nearly as impossible to promote one on merit.Now onto the second bit. Could corporate culture business in America embrace and forward a relatively democratic method, to give people more security collectively and individually at their jobs? In a word, no. A corporation in a capitalist system exists for one reason - providing a profit to the shareholders, the owners of the corporation. Profit comes from productivity, and when people learn they aren’t rewarded for their productivity they will do the minimum. This was the case under the communist workers collectives in the Soviet Union and in the pre-Deng reform era of China. Those collectives were never profitable and required government support. Any corporation in the west that followed that model would soon be bankrupt.There has been mixed success with smaller collectives, such as some kibbutzim in Israel and some artists collectives in the USA and Canada, but they are rare.",73,1,417,"1,548",0,0

It is really time for the Democrats to move on. The Hillary Clinton Campaign was handed a pasting, primarily due to its conventional approach to campaigning as well as failing to comprehend the extensive changes that has occurred in information technology. If anything, the DNC should thank Russia, and any other foreign actors, for waking them up. The Democrats were hit it in a number of ways.There was no reason for the DNC server for being penetrated. Nor for the e-mail files of the DNC, Podesta and others from being hacked. And, even then, for retaining sensitive e-mails and other files that were archived in unencrypted, unsecured form that can be retrieved from publicly accessible, cloud servers by anonymous hackers and such files were readable and/or manipulated for public dissemination (such as via WikiLeaks). Cybersecurity has been known for many years beforehand.Nor did the Clinton campaign realized that voter polling has become quite sophisticated. Computer analytics of polls compared to mined data information have given pollsters far deeper understanding of voters’ psyches, information from which can be exploited to a candidate’s advantage. And the deep reach of data-mining leading to extremely refined targeting of audiences for critical messaging through social media and its far reach through tagwords and taglines for key promotion and advertising. There has been nothing better than Facebook’s distribution algorithms.Gaining an understanding of the Russian experiment in campaign meddling during the 2016 Presidential Campaign will, at least, put the Democrats maybe, at best, just one step behind the upcoming Republican mid-term campaigners for 2018.

1,Does the Democratic party really represent the working class?,Working Class,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"This is difficult for me to write, but no.In general, it wants to. Many members believe they are doing exactly that too.The left has a choice to make, and it boils down to economic representation being on par with social issue representation.There is no nice way to resolve this. Progressives are seeking to win elections, become a greater part of government and present Americans with what an effective left opposition looks like.In the end, this Democrat believes all this is good for the party and for the people.Right now we are living grim times. Many of us want to express fear of what that means, how long, and so forth. The other top responses involve blame and shame.Consider leaving blame and shame off the table. Those votes, or no votes happened and people had their reasons. It is more productive to understand those reasons than to render judgement.What matters now is the votes to come and what it takes to get people to believe in and vote for better policy.People fear not being able to see the doctor. They experience shame not being able to feed their kids, afford a modest place to live.Many of them blame money in politics. They may blame the parties too.In my view, the single most effective thing Democrats can do is to talk with people, not at them, and do that to understand who they are looking to represent and what that representation needs to look like. Then act on that with positive, vote for type politics.Many Americans do not vote, and we need them to. Shaming them, trying to bully them, disenfranchise them, and blaming them really does not result in the excitement and GOTV motivation needed for the party to take back seats and do the good for Americans they need it to do.It is ultra important to recognize being against the worst does not mean good. It can mean that, but it can also mean less worse too. In this frame, the common, public good just happens by preventing the worst from happening.Far too many Americans question how effective doing that is, and those questions have boiled up into over 1000 seats lost too.What we have been doing as a party isn't working anymore. And our best move is to address that head on. No excuses.On the other hand, being about explicit, common, public good is a positive strategy people can link to their vote and to a brighter future. The bonus is we not only avoid the worst, but do so with a far more potent politics people will get behind and believe in.In all of that is more meaningful economic representation, brought up to par with the fine social issue representation Democrats are known for.I am both concerned and excited. My concern is about all the risks and potential costs associated with the changes needed. If we squabble too much, we may end up worse off.I am excited, because this growing movement to assert positive, common, public good policy represents some of the best in politics. It is not the same as beating the bad guy in that we also get to cheer good people, and be for things, not just against them.Politics is ugly in the USA right now.

3,What is something that needs to be said about Democrats?,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"They are about to undergo a major revolution, hopefully for the better.Republicans had to figure it out out of necessity. Trump came on the scene and cast off the political burdens of the “good old boys” club by hook or by crook, much to the chagrin of many. If Trump didn't win in 2016, the Republican party would be dead as a doornail. Even now, the Romneys and McCains may very well break ranks into their own Whig party out of pure disdain.The fact that Trump latched onto the idea of being “the biggest F.U. to the establishment” (as Michael Moore put it) speaks volumes to younger generations.Millenials and Gen Z are increasingly going Republican. Conservatism is the new rebel cause. This is a reaction against being told what to think and how to speak across the board.Exasperating the issue was the DNC muscling out their own potential “F.U.” to the status quo: Bernie Sanders. Don't get me wrong; I think he is extremely misguided, but at least he is somewhat sincere in his beliefs. The only difference was that Republicans realized (only when faced with this life or death scenario) that having this candidate was their one last shot at making the party relevant again from an economic and patriotic perspective.Democrats need to take control of their party for legit principles, as the Trumpers had to, or face extinction. I encourage my Dem counterparts to fight the lame-duck powers that have made their party part of “the man” and foment your own party recalibration. On both our sides, the Old Guard career politicians have been in there way too long.I encourage every Dem revolutionary to vote against the Schumers and Pelosis and put patriotic Democrats in office that have enticing real world platforms…besides “f*** Trump” or “WASPs are evil.” Eyes are opening to previous media rhetoric—it won't work if you keep pushing it.We want to work with you on core issues, not debate why we should have 80-gender bathrooms.As with any legitimate business, be the guy that offers possible long-term solutions (as much as I may disagree with them), not the guy that screams how much he hates the CEO and stomps out of the meeting while throwing his sippy cup at the window.Republicans took their collective sippy cup and poured it on the floor while staring the establishment in the eye.

3,What is something that needs to be said about Democrats?,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"I have several things to say, but the main thing is this- secular liberalism, in the John Stuart Mill sense of the word, used to be the Democrat's thing. They seem to have abandoned it in whole or in part, sometimes subverting or undermining its core tenets (sometimes not always it depends on who and how extreme and how progressive), and it seems like the Republicans and/or Libertarians and/or center right is picking that up and trying to do right by those ideas. Democrats are certainly capable of doing so- at the very least they could emphasize a point of common ground- but it doesn’t seem to be there very much anymore, even in the background or in an indirect way.There are two other things I want to say. One is that with a two party system, you've got to have a bunch of very different people come together around a clear set of unitive ideas. This should and often does lead to a situation where those who share the same subcategory or people-group may go in different directions with their political ideology. The Democrats at this point in time seem to be trying to craft a coalition of voting blocs instead, and it's losing sight of unitive ideas that everyone can get behind. Various groups (very different from one another) have their own unique issues of self interest, and the strategy is to maintain voting blocs so those interests can be taken care of. This seems like a flawed strategy for two reasons. One, many of these voting blocs are going to be difficult to maintain, partly because some of these groups have nothing in common and/or don't like each other. And two, there's nothing particularly moral or righteous about saying This is my race, This is my gender, This is my religion, so show me esteem do crap for me and give me what I want. Stating interests and approaching issues in this way does not give you the moral high ground, and even if you do have the moral high ground on a particular issue, it's more important that you know How to be morally right, you know Why something is morally right, and the reasons must be better than This is a group's interest that is aligned with me for political reasons. This is political gamesmanship under the guise of a moral argument- Even If you do happen to be morally right this time. The procedure is what I want to draw your attention to. I will acknowledge that white Protestant Christians do something very similar with the Republican party- it mostly flies under the radar but I have noticed and I commented on it in response to a different question- but it's very much true of many Democrats as well.There is one final thing that I would like to say. Democrats, Republicans, and Libertarians all have a tendency to place a large and I would argue undue amount of emphasis on a certain issue or concern. For Libertarians, the concern is liberty in the sense of keeping all people out of handcuffs if at all possible. They try to prevent a government from doing almost everything, especially if it involves force. This leads to weird situations where they might say all taxation is theft. Conservatives place emphasis on conserving certain aspects of US society and culture, with a particular eye for white Protestant Christians. That winds up being an interest group of its own, asking for special favor and esteem because they like it and its feels good- not because there's a good moral argument for it. And finally, Democrats- who, at this time, seem overly interested in identifying victims and oppressors, so they can help the victims and take down the oppressors. This can be a bit of a problem when both Jews and Muslims are voting blocs you depend on, to give you one example. Additionally, pursuit of a clear oppressor/victim narrative can be messy or nonexistent, and you just can't depend on that type of storyline being as clear and truthful as you want it to be. Sometimes it is clear, but often not, and this can't be the only thing that you go to. It is exactly what the Democrats are doing, as of right now, but this is not a long term plan. For any of these categories- including the one that Democrats care about the most right now- all of these concerns have provisional value some of the time. It would be a mistake to ignore any one of them entirely or to focus on any one of them exclusively.In the interest of finding more common ground in a politically polarized country, and in the interest of a more grounded morality and unitive ideology within the party, this is what I would say to and about Democrats. I will say just one other thing about myself and about the country as a whole- as you read this, you may be thinking that I'm not particularly impressed with any political party. That's a good instinct- I'm not, and this type of independent outlook has never been more prevalent in US history.

He is well-liked in the establishment wing of Democratic politics.Others include Kirsten Gillibrand, Amy Klobuchar, and, of course, Bernie Sanders, though the DNC will work night and day to block him from the nomination.Personally, I don’t think Elizabeth Warren will seek the Presidency. She seems very comfortable pushing her progressive politics in the upper chamber.Outside the Senate, former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick has received heaps of covert support from Obama and his allies. Patrick doesn’t have a very dominant personality, however, so I don’t think he’ll make much noise in a crowded field. Certainly not as Bernie did.Joe Biden is flirting with 2020, but I don’t think he’ll run. If he’s sufficiently satisfied with the Democrats running, which appears likely, Biden will simply act as a helpful hand in the election process.Now, it’s very possible that someone else will takeover.

Of those, Obama has met with nine; I take that to mean that there are at least nine who have taken their potential candidacies a few serious extra steps.Based on my semi-monthly instant runoff surveys of my fellow NYC grassroots Dems since late Nov. 16, only Warren and Biden have received majority support/approval in a majority of the surveys, 78% and 67% respectively. In the second tier, receiving majority support/approval in 39% of the surveys, is Gillibrand and Harris. In the third tier is Sanders and Booker, receiving majority support/approval in 28% and 17% of the surveys respectively. No one else has done that well.From that, I take that those are the candidates who have a realistic shot. I so conclude because these surveys of mine have tended to be prophetic. Back in 05 and 06, when analysts and pundits were saying Hillary was the favorite and Edwards was her nearest competitor, and everyone figured Obama as an also-ran, my surveys showed a tight two-person race between Hillary and Obama, and Edwards never did much better than third place. The folks I survey are high-information high-involvement folks. Name recognition for some of the dark horses are not a problem for them. In other words, their heads are in a place where average Democrats won’t find themselves until early 2020. Which is why I believe these surveys may be leading indicators.If I’m right then the Dem nominee will be one of those six people.Assuming I’m correct, my conclusion is that those six people will be the finalists for the 2020 nomination.We shall see.",132,3,13,64,0,0

At the county fair, the League of Women Voters had a table and registered people to vote in the same manner.I have mentioned on Quora before that the day Kris Kobach, our Sec. of State determined that everyone needed a photo id to vote I was helping a neighbor in a nursing home. She was a “never miss” voter. Her tablemates at lunch got in a discussion about what they were going to do as they no longer had drivers licenses and told me that by the time you are in a nursing home you have down sized to the point that you no longer have your birth certificate and marriage and divorce paperwork to create a paper trail to explain your current name which is required. I called our local Election Office to inquire about what these ladies would do to be able to register. She said Mr. Kobach said the office would supply transportation for seniors. I told her this would have to be wheelchair vans. She said OMG and hung up. Some counties Election Office is only open on the 5th Thursday. This type of thing is creating a problem for people to register.In bigger cities, poor people may have difficulty paying for transportation to get to Election Offices to register.

Bush also had lost the popular vote and the excuse (for how can the loser claim “consent of the governed” and thus legitimacy?) of voter fraud was the reason for the study.Let me put it this way: voter fraud is brought up in terms of national elections, most recently when Trump claimed if it had not been for 3 or 4 million illegal aliens voting, he would have won the popular vote. Now here is the question:With 130 million votes for President, how stupid would you have to be to risk losing your job, your family, and spending 10 years in prison and then being deported, to add one fraudulent vote to 130 million? In reality, no one that stupid has ever been found An American citizen now sits in prison in Texas because she voted without knowing that she was not qualified. It was not her intent to violate the voting laws but her lack of information that enabled her to think she had the right to vote. She has been sentenced to 5 years for her honest mistake.The Trump Electoral Integrity Commission has now been dismantled because its head was caught lying about voter fraud and they had nothing to justify their work. Most states in the US have Republican governors and not one of them has accepted the claim that in their state voter fraud took place, nor have the Democratic governors.So is there fraud? Absolutely, but it is electoral fraud, including purge lists that keep hundreds of thousands of legitimate voters from voting, voter suppression laws that discourage voting in Democratic-leaning areas, and of course the great rigging of American elections, the Electoral College, created by slave owners to create a firewall against the People and allowing them, a distinct minority, to rule the new nation, with 10 of the first 12 Presidents having owned slaves the first President, elected by 43,000 propertied white males in a nation of 3 million, being the richest and largest slave owner and the second President in the top 1% of slave owners.The Electoral College, in our new century has worked as planned: it has allowed a group of 538 party hacks to overturn 2 of the last 3 elections, giving us the catastrophic disaster of George Bush and the continuing trainwreck of Donald Trump, both of whom lost the popular vote but were declared the winners by the Electoral College, which violates both key principles on which the nation was founded, as expressed in the Declaration of Independence: for a ruler to be legitimate and just, Jefferson wrote, there must be equality (small rural conservative states have 3 1/3 more voting weight per voter than the large states where most Americans live) and consent of the governed.By definition, the loser of the public vote cannot claim to have their consent: consent, as Jefferson wrote, comes from the majority, or at least (in a split vote) by the person with the most votes/consnt and can never be claimed by the loser.And so we see that while voter fraud is a fake scandal, electoral fraud is legal and enshrined in a Constitution which betrayed our founding principles and makes it possible for the ultimate absurdity, that the loser of the vote of the people governed would be declared the ruler.",103,3,187,560,0,0

To a degree would you say representatives even a president can only do what the people will allow?,Voters,Democratic Party (US politics),Politics,1!,1!,1!,"Where to begin?The US does not use a democratic system of government: it is a Republic. The people don’t make the decisions: they choose the people who do. Once your vote is cast, your sole method of persuasion is bothering your representative, and potentially voting for someone else in the next election.Ultimately, every individual is responsible for their own actions: that’s true for your Congressman, your Senators, your President, whether you voted for them or not. Their decisions are theirs and theirs alone.Now, that’s not to say that the electorate don’t have some responsibility for what their elected officials do: you are, after all, responsible for putting them in office in the first place. That part is definitely on you.Thereafter, you have a responsibility to continue to participate in the politics of your nation. There are a lot of Americans whose participation stops at the voting booth (and a considerable number who didn’t even do that, in the last election!). You might not have authority or a stick to wield over your representatives, but your First Amendment rights allow you to speak up and let your voice be heard, without government interference.Governance by consent doesn’t work in a Republic, by the by: if the people stand up and say “Do not do this!”, the government is not officially obligated to listen. There’s no showing of hands: you picked the guys who make the decisions, and if you don’t like those decisions, you don’t have any official recourse until the next election. However…You are responsible if your representatives do something you don’t like, and you don’t do anything to express that.

Therefore, a candidate can say one thing and do another thing once in office.

Jobs are coming back, we all got our taxes cut, some people got bonuses (crumbs to Nancy Pelosi), we are on the verge of ending a war almost as old as I am, ISIS is no longer the horrendous terror they once were,Now the Democrats are telling us that all the have to offer is being AGAINST all of that simply because President Trump is in part responsible for it. In 2010 the Republicans told us they’d stop Obama and the Democrats from hurting us any more with things like Obamacare. In 2018 the Democrats are telling us they’ll stop President Trump and the Republicans from giving us strength and prosperity. I’m pretty sure that won’t work.",12,0,21,157,0,0

What comes of this is still open for debate but we are better off than we were. He got the ball rolling and I’m not sure it will matter who has Congress moving forward here.On Trade he has some major hurdles and it won’t matter who controls the Congress. His reactionary impulses on trade are very retro-Democrat and not Republican, at all. He is going to get pushback from Republicans unless they are willing to individually stake out ground as protectionists, which they won’t. Unless they are willing to hang up their spurs once he’s gone.His immigration policy is pretty messy. It seems to be “no brown people and no poor people”. That’s not a policy. It’s a wishlist. I don’t think he really believes this either. He certainly got a bunch of guest worker Visas for Mar a Lago, after winning office and the Trump Org still employs a lot of poor Brown people. This was a tool to get elected. He does want less Muslims but religious tests are UnConstitutional and no one is gonna help him repeal the 1st Amendment.What’s left?Infrastucture? Almost two years in and we still haven’t seen a plan. His deficits are already too high so he’s out of money to spend.The Wall? The Democrats were gonna cave on that for DACA but Trump balked. He balked because he knows that the GOP isn’t going to pay for that Wall and would gut the plan in committees and through appropriations.Opioids? Again, almost two years in and we’ve seen nothing. There is no plan. So it’s an agenda item with no actual policy attached.Military Procurement? Eh. His best ally on this was always John McCain and their feud has essentially killed this anyway.A new Iran Nuclear Deal? Not happening. He’s pissed off Europe and Russia is intractable right now. China could care less because they’ve committed money to Iran, are building their Asian superhighway and need that Iranian Oil. Iran will get a nuke eventually but might be slow about it to get the French and Germans engaged.Making nice with Russia? Not happening until Putin retires. Doesn’t matter who controls Congress. The Pentagon ain’t having it, neither is Intel, neither are the allies and certainly not the Democrats. Given that, plus it’s Russia, the GOP will bulwark Against this.Fighting global terror? What does this even mean anymore? Counter Terrorism operations will be carried out no matter who has the Executive and the Legislature. It would require a complete overhaul of the entire government and both parties to alter the current dynamics.Healthcare Reform? Good luck. The ACA was an attempt to save for profit medicine and the Health Insurance industry. Whether it worked or not is a never ending debate. The options left are not great and either end up at single payer or we go back to Helthcare equals bankruptcy. The only fix will have to be bipartisan and a massive undertaking and it will almost certainly have a negative economic impact no matter what. Trump never had a plan beyond let the Republicans fix it and the Republicans never had a plan beyond blame Democrats. We will end up with a limited single payer for emergencies with a long term care model in private markets eventually. The when is the question modified by before or after a national healthcare crisis?Thats it.Trump lacks the attention span or interest to get into anything more granular. He runs around playing Alpha Male but that seems to have run out of juice internationally. The other leaders just don’t care and standing up to him scores political points at home. The US will no longer lead internationally under Donald Trump and he seems fine with that. At least I think that he thinks he is fine with that. The reality will piss him off once it takes hold.With foreign policy essentially on hold or in limbo regarding multilateral actions and Russia and China having Hawks in both parties in Congress he is kinda stuck. China and Russia both have his number maybe and his own team are the impediment, not the Democrats.A Democratic Senate could cut into his judicial appointment schedule. They could clip Pruitt’s deregulatory work at EPA. They could hold hearings on everything but realistically Trump’s biggest obstacle is and has always been Donald John Trump. He likes to play games more than work. For him it’s about attitude and spectacle not policy. The problem is that policy is governance.In this he might actually be better off with a Democratic Congress. He’d have his adversary to wrestle everyday. He’d be forced to adhere to some policy outline and he could use the bully pulpit domestically instead of internationally which is kind of backfiring.I don’t think the Democrats would even necessarily Impeach him. He’s a useful tool in the White House to stymie Republican leadership. He’s also seriously polarizing and running against him as an incumbent, with an actual record to attack, is better than some fresh eyed generic Republican.Oddly on Trade, his one real belief system, he likely has more allies in a potential Democratic Caucus than he ever will among the GOP. The Progressives will happily shut down Trade with countries with awful human rights records. The procorporate Dems will willingly play tough on China for positioning value and the oldschoolers will happily go along with anything that looks even vaguely like it promotes domestic production because they are actually the last pro-labor politicians left.He might even get his Wall if he gives in on DACA and reinstituring some of the ACA provisions that were left out, like reinsurance and government plan options.

I’ve seen xenophobic slogans plastered on public transport along the lines of “Mexico para los mexicanos! Fuera los extranjeros!”But I would put it at about the level of Germany and far less than in Australia or the US.Of the black people I knew in Mexico, one was I think from Haiti and now lived and ran a tiny business in Mexico City, one was a middle aged African American expat, one was Nigerian who had lived in Europe and spoke native level English with a London accent, one was Kenyan who had lived in the US and spoke almost native level English with an American accent, and one was English with I think Jamaican heritage.Of those, only the Nigerian found Mexicans to be racist to her. And this was mainly because of strangers staring and pointing. None of my other black friends reacted as badly to this as she did. My interpretation was that it wasn’t racism but a combination of ignorance and curiosity. There are black Mexicans but they’re in small isolated poor communities mostly, like Chacahua in Oaxaca. So to your average Mexcian from a big city black people are still pretty exotic. I knew a handful of white people in China who reacted the same way to the same kind of attention from Chinese people.So, overall, I wouldn’t say that there is much if any specific anti-black racism that Mexican immigrants to the US are bringing with them, whether they’re illiterate or illegal or not.If they bring some biases with them about African American people it’s likely based on what they’ve been exposed to in movies and TV.

While his populist message resonated with many Democratic voters, Sanders didn’t do any work “behind the scenes” to court the favor of party leaders and organizers in the months leading up to the election. Thus, he didn’t have the support of organizers that would get out the vote and promote his candidacy with the party and major Democratic donors that would pay to get his message across.Sanders really exposed the limitations of running a voter-focused primary campaign in our current system. He focused on voter turnout through social media, avoiding funding from Super-PACs, and using Internet “meet ups” to organize campaign stops.However, with the mix of demographics in the Democratic Party, that left him underexposed to older or more rural Democratic voters and party activists that decide on primary candidates the “old fashioned” way, through the recommendations of local and state party leaders, newspaper endorsements, and the like.Bernie’s big mistake was not modeling his candidacy on Jimmy Carter’s successful bid for the Democratic race in 1976. Carter announced his candidacy in late 1974 and was thought to have no chance and no name recognition. His strategy was to go to regions, make speeches, and talk with the Democratic party leadership before other candidates would go there - he campaigned in 37 states before any other candidate had announced they were in the race.Carter understood that the local and state leadership of the party and the influencers in the party at the local level would be the key factor in turning out voters on election day. His strategy worked and, by mid-1976, Carter was the front-runner against all the other primary candidates by a big margin.Bernie thought that just trying to reach voters directly would be enough, but, without local and state influencers buying into his campaign, there was a significant part of the Democratic vote that Sanders just couldn’t reach.While Sanders supporters saw him as being rejected by the “big money” factions of the party who were “in the bag” for Hillary, the truth is that Sanders only campaigned to part of the Democratic party.",2.8k,57,40,112,0,0

4,If Israel was a US state would it vote Republican or Democrat?,Democratic Party vs. Republican Party,Voting,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Hard to say. It is quite likely to be split, more or less along the current lines of Center-left vs. right.What makes is complicated is the fact that enlightened people tend to support noble human and humane values. We support democracy. Equality, fraternity and liberty. But these noble ideas are NOT really effective when there are difficult existential problems to be solved. For Israel, security and standing up to the many people who would actually like to kill us, forces our concern for others to be tempered by necessary security actions: if a Palestinian wishes to travel in a problematic area under our MILITARY control, he will have to undergo a security check, which is inconvenient and degrading, because he or his neighbor MIGHT be carrying bombs to kill innocents.This is how it begins. It also evolves: observers who are NOT acquainted with all the details, or who have already judged and are only trying to prove their existing AGENDA, will start claiming that the roadblocks are NOT a real necessity, they reflect evil intention by Israel. And the Israelis will start believing that ALL Palestinians have evil intention too. And the RESULT of this friction will be to persuade MORE people on BOTH sides that their belief of the evil of the other side is true, while actually causing a self-fulfilling prophesy - people WILL start behaving more badly.SO: Many Israelis support Trump, because of his actions regarding dealing with enemies, and because he really calls a spade a spade. (Many Americans seem to hate him because he calls a spade a dirty, bloody, damned spade). I think many Israelis see the same hatred directed at Trump as we see directed at us - often, because of prejudice, or pure dislike, and accompanied by false narratives to demonize him, as false narratives are used against us to demonize us.When trump pulled out of the Paris agreement - many said he is not trying to save the planet - and he actually said the Paris deal was bad because IT did NOT stop CO2 emissions, but would cost the USA billions anyway. (The USA has DONE what the Paris accord suggests be done - limit carbon emissions). When he spoke harshly to NATO, the Europeans said he is no longer their ally - but he was only asking the richest European country to pay the 2% GNP fee NATO requires, instead of depending on the USA to foot their bill. When he left the Iran deal, hysterical accusations were made that he is prepared for WAR - when in fact he said a BETTER DEAL was required, that would REALLY stop war. The Iran deal ALLOWS them to openly make bombs in 7 years time, and to clandestinely continue their plans in their military bases, where inspection is forbidden and where recent proof has emerged they HAD genuine secret weapons programs going on. Almost EVERYTHING Trump does becomes twisted and demonized - but when you look coolly at the facts (not the style) he really appears to be doing the right, honest, decent, honorable and courageous thing every time. And Israel ? Same for us. Israel for example gives sick children from Syria, Gaza and all the surrounding Arab countries free medical aid - and is accused of stealing their organs. We supply Gaza with all its food, water, electricity and gas - but because we limit military supplies to Hamas, everybody says Israel is starving the Gazans.

Most narrow definitions involve money. If you pay for a membership, then you are a member. Here in GA the lowest level of party membership is the precinct caucus.

Despite getting money from me at least 7 times 2014–2017 the man who collects the money, and keeps the list of who is and is not a member, does not consider me a member.I personally object to a political party being so obsessed with money. My observation is that volunteers not motivated by money are worth far more in politics than the money, which is seldom spent wisely.On the other hand, national party organizations, both R and D, repeatedly send me emails calling me a member in good standing who will lose my membership if I don’t send them more money. Of course, I have never sent them money in the first place. The whole thing by both R and D is such a scam.The LP party gave up on me many years ago in IL. They have not contacted me in GA, although I have exchanged phone numbers and email with many of their members.The GA Constitution Party considers me a friend and invites me to their Saturday teleconferences. They never ask for money. I don’t think they consider me a member, just a friend.Bottom line, “member” means so many different things to so many different people, and even the same person finds it convenient to change the meaning to suit the situation.When I was in IL, the same thing was true with both the R and D parties. Although I have a lot of contact with Democrat voters, I have not taken the initiative to establish much contact with those who care about a definition of membership.",36,1,114,"1,997",0,0

It is trivial to change at any time.However, the parties are still private institutions even though the Big Two are effectively the entire Government. So they make up their own rules. Each major party has a national level and state parties as well. In some places, one is not allowed to vote in a primary unless one is already registered some length of time in advance. In other places, people can simply mark their change at the time they go to vote.The DNC and RNC (national committees) are I presume corporations that have funds, can hire staff, and so on.I think to be an “active member” of the party, some would say they simply have to vote. Others would say that they should be contributing funds. Others would say they have to be employed by the party, or be working/volunteering for them. Others might say it refers to the politicians themselves—people who hold government offices, whether by election or by appointment.",77,2,347,"1,385",0,0

Assuming we are talking about the Infamous McCarthy and not one of the others, he was operating at the very height of the Cold War.Mccarthy was also an ass and President Eisenhower was simply biding his time to drop the rhetorical hammer on him.This was also an era where Presidents were grudgingly supported by the opposition regarding all external issues, no matter how contentious individual relationships were. If MCarthy had called Ike a traitor, he would have been blasted by both parties in unison. Then again that was Ike.That was a very different Republican Party. That party would have recoiled at the hypothetical proposed here.The G7 didn’t exist then. Europe was still in its postwar reconstruction and the familial bonds between the US and Canada were as yet immature.This is much different today. The G7 today are operationally the partners of American postwar hegemony. We call American Presidents, the Leader of the Free World and the Most Powerful Man in the World because of the relationships involved in this particular alliance. By crapping on the G7, President Trump erodes his own international power base.There currently is no analogue to McCarthy and their has never before been an analogue to Trump. They get compared at times but McCarthy never wielded the Power of a modern President and Trump lacks the endurance of McCarthy.With regards to the G7, there is another difference as well. During the “Red Scare” Congress seemed paralyzed to cope with McCarthy, both parties mind you, and President Eisenhower was carefull to mind his step until the insanity reached a certain pitch. The modern Republicans are at a loss on how to cope with Trump, generally, but enacting Trade Wars with allies while giving cover to Chinese State Run Companies involved in domestic espionage and weak Russian policy gets them agitated.They are treading carefully because they hope for a peaceful solution on the Korean Peninsula but the collapse of the G7 carries real and immediate consequences at home in the districts.So, in short; This is New.We haven’t seen this before.",218,4,275,"1,377",0,0

That paranoia still exists today and is creating very unstable conditions between nations.McCarthy started the purge and Trueman enhanced it by putting everyone on notice that even the suggestion of a fascist or communist affiliation would destroy them.I am not sure how NK fits into the question but what it seems to boil down to, is the US needs a boogieman to keep the home fires and fears burning to justify endless war and a badly bloated dominating military complex.I don’t know that things are any different, the boogieman today is a “Terrorist” instead of a “Communist” .

This was Clinton’s election to lose, and lose it she did.We can blame the Dem party, of course. They had the resources and the experience to prevent the 2016 results, and yet they couldn’t. It also seems that they were surprised by the results. That suggests that something was different about the 2016 election, and I don’t mean Clinton, one of the most maligned candidates a major party ever nominated, because the Dems were aware that Clinton had been targeted. What was different is the social media campaign that was the backdrop to everything in the 2016 election, and this was not a factor the Dems had included in their calculations.We can blame the voters. They were inundated by social platform messaging designed to discourage participation in the election by Clinton’s supporters, and to encourage participation by conservatives. Clinton supporters simply failed to show up for their candidate by a two to one margin, when they showed up for Obama. The social engineering campaign was devastatingly effective.We can blame the GOP, who have spent the past three decades working at the state level to gerrymander districts so that even without a popular vote majority a GOP candidate can get the majority of Electoral College votes. (Which also means we could blame the Founders, as well as later generations, who made gerrymandering possible and legal under these circumstances.)Why did the Dems fail?

They come to drain and loot it.Quote -At the federal, state, and local levels, taxpayers shell out approximately $134.9 billion to cover the costs incurred by the presence of more than 12.5 million illegal aliens, and about 4.2 million citizen children of illegal aliens.

1,How do Democrats and Republicans (generally) differ on the main issue of illegal aliens living/working in the United States?,Undocumented Immigrants,Illegal Immigration,1!,1!,1!,1!,"In very general terms. Democrats see the influx of illegal aliens as people coming from countries with troubled economies and high levels of violence and disorder who want to work in America and who provide needed labor for jobs Americans are not interested in filling. Stoop labor is overwhelmingly done by transient immigrant labor, as is much construction labor, and despite what some Conservatives like to say, they are not taking American jobs from American citizens. Every time there is a crackdown on illegal immigration in America it sends agricultural and the construction trades into a panic as they lose laborers they cannot replace. I am a Residential General Contractor in Washington state and Mexican labor is a huge part of the framing and sheetrock trades, and of course in the agricultural sector we are huge producers of wheat, apples and other produce. And our state, like the entire nation is desperately short of people willing or able to take those jobs.Republicans typically see this as a legal issue. If people come here illegally they should be rounded up and sent home because, well, they came here illegally. Though it is not the entire reason for their stridency around the issue, racism most certainly plays a part. Illegals are seen as people who live on the fringes on American society and are largely unassimilable into American culture.

1,How do Democrats and Republicans (generally) differ on the main issue of illegal aliens living/working in the United States?,Undocumented Immigrants,Illegal Immigration,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Generally speaking, Democrats make no distinction between good and bad immigrants, regardless of legal, illegal, refugee or other non-citizen status.Generally speaking, Republicans are more divided. Historically, Capitalists, Corporatists, libertarians, Evangelicals, Catholics and other Republicans have made a distinction between good and bad immigrants, regardless of status.Recently, a populist strain has entered the Republican party that paints all illegal immigrants as bad. By omission, it gave those with a legal status a pass. That is most significantly seen in the opposition to illegals voting, which gave the impression that it was OK for those with legal status to vote. This new populist strain is not ideological. It makes no attempt to be logically consistent. How long it can maintain prominence is not certain.The modern version of the traditional Republican position is this:Government action towards immigrants should focus on the undesirables, the bad.Focus on terrorist sympathizers. Nobody should be in the US who does not agree with the American understanding of the Declaration of Independence and the US Constitution. Immigrants who want to create unAmerican sub-communities are not welcome.Focus on murderers, rapists, DUI drivers. I draw the line between DUI drivers and speeders. Others draw the line elsewhere. The exact position of the line is negotiable… whatever gets the votes in Congress is OK with me.Focus on welfare parasites. We should not be building another underclass in the US. No welfare regardless of immigration status. More than any other, this divides the Republicans and Democrats. If Republicans would run on this and silence the populist inconsistencies, Republicans would win even more than they already win.And, of course, this is what Republicans really believe.",35,0,114,"1,997",0,0

There is no national security issue in getting important materials from our allies, that will end up raising the cost of goods in the US.Donald Trump has always run his enterprises, and now the country by constant dodging and weaving—keeping people off balance.

And now though Russia is no longer as massive as the USSR was, it is still one of the primary forces trying to destabilize and split the Western bloc of nations. And now, there are serious expressions of concern about the loss of America as a stable and predictable ally with considerations that they may need to cooperate as a bloc without the US. Trump’s unpredictable and nationalistic posturing is alienating exactly those nations we need to continue to advance the principles of democratic rule and he is opening a huge void into which China is eager to exploit.

Perhaps there are a few, but I doubt there are enough to be able to perform the action you request with the flexibility of an actual moderator, that is, determining what is a “personal attack” in a way that won’t be easily misinterpreted.There has never been a time in our history when presidents were not personally attacked. Why that is considered appropriate is because the founders made clear a president’s character was of prime importance. So if it could be shown that it was lacking, that meant his power should be curtailed somehow. From the kind of attacks made against Trump and by Trump supporters against those critics, it would seem the public should lose power somehow.

Of course this is assuming she lives in my house, because otherwise why would I allow or not allow her to do anything?

Not to mention you are just kicking the can down the road, unless you are planning to save your child from every choice and encounter they make for the rest of their lives, which is just silly. It is much better to give your children the tools they need to encounter and overcome problems on their own than to shield them from problems. Now, if my daughter brought Billy home, I wouldn’t let them date, on the grounds that a 17 year old dating a married 70+ year old with a history of using women just seems like a recipe for disaster. I would definitely question the nature of that relationship. That being said, if my 18+, independent daughter told me she was dating the former president, I would bring those same concerns up to her in a constructive discussion. I would make it clear to her that she understood why I saw it as an issue. (50+ years of age difference, womanizer, Democrat [kidding!], etc.) I would ask her how the relationship is going to help her, and make clear that there is a real possibility she is being used.

1,Is it possible to have an intelligent conversation with any Democrat?,Conversational Frameworks ,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"This is me, an outsider to US politics, telling you that there are vested interests involved when talking with politicians. No matter their affiliation.The mere fact that a politician is affiliated with a party compels them to stand with the party line as much as they can possibly do without committing political suicide (which is akin to violating the party line as that will seriously damage their standing with such party and cost them the next election ).In private, you may have a very different experience than in public. It is known that many politicians on either side of an argument may not personally fully back the party position at all times - this is what backchanneling is for. Change the minds of enough individual politicians within a block of power and you can affect the position of the entire block. But until such consensus is achieved, none of the individuals will likely flip on their own.Now, from my outside perspective, many ideas the Democrats in the US float are less-than-ideal, so are many, many, many, of the ideas promoted by their Republican counterparts.Still, when I speak with some of my US friends, some of which are registered Republicans and some who are registered Democrats, reason tends to find its way and the only disagreements we usually fall back on are of a fundamental philosophical kind.Those disagreements, even in “an intelligent conversation”, you cannot bridge.Do we punish those who do wrong……because they deserve it?…because it fixes a problem?The second reason, you can question and discuss. The first one, you cannot.

Their ability to hit the United States with a nuclear tipped ballistic missile puts them in a position to bargain, but that’s about all they have to bargain with, and what they want is the assurance that we will support Kim Jong Un’s desire to stay in power, and to do what we can to ensure his survival.So, at a high level, pretty simple, we agree to support and protect Kim Jong Un, while bringing North Korea into the community of nations, modernizing the place and dropping the crippling sanctions, while the North Koreans agree to giving up their nuclear weapons in a verifiable manner.What’s the downside of that, for either side?Cynics will say “Oh, this is just typical North Korean behaviour, they’ll go to the summit, get pictures with President Trump, then get all aggressive and demand everything, agree to give up nothing, and it will fail.”Okay, sure, they might do that. And if President Obama was still in power, he might negotiate with them and get a terrible deal, like he did with Iran.But President Trump isn’t going to do that — a photo op with a President that half the world thinks is clownshoes? Who cares? He wouldn’t mind showing up for that and, if Kim and his team are unreasonable, he will just walk away, like he did when he sent his letter calling off the summit.Doom and gloom apocalyptic scenarios aside (North Korea fires off their arsenal and wipes out millions of people in South Korea, Japan and the United States, quickly followed up by the United States turning North Korea into a nuclear wasteland, killing Kim, his cohorts and pretty much everyone in the country, something Kim is desperate to avoid,) there is literally no downside in the United States’ dealings with North Korea.They come to the table and act belligerent? Trump gets up and walks away. Sorry, you had your chance, we’re done here. Getting up and walking away is Negotiation 101.

It needs to be unconditional on both sides. It is a simple technicality, but paves the way for trade and possible reunification of the two Koreas and is tangible progress for the world to see.I don't think we should normalize relations or lift sanctions until the north has denuclearized and that action is verifiable and verified in an ongoing manner. It is understandable that the North is not going to give up nukes without a non-aggression pact with the USA. Which is fairly easy as long as they don't attack SK, Australia, Japan, or any of our allies.NK has trillions of dollars of marketable minerals. It just doesn't have the equipment and infrastructure to mine and export them. So economic aid and development could be eventually offered once sanctions come off.However all that is contingent on denuclearization, the stated postion of the Trump Administration is that denuclearization must come before any help from the USA. With that comes access to aid and investments from countries all over the world. Which is so desperately needed by the majority of the poverty stricken NK population.There is also a major upside to this situation for the USA. The world would see America facilitate peace and integration of a country into the serious club of the international world of both culture and econmics, without a shot flying or a bomb dropped.

They understood that you do not offer the legitimacy of meeting with a US President with such a man (see links below).Back when the USA had real Presidents, they would meet with responsible leaders who respected the democratic process, who developed sane economic policies that provided jobs, built homes and goods for export, and allowed participation in the world economy. And as we saw last week, Donald Trump has disdain for such leaders, and berates them publicly.Trump, however, lauds Kim Jong-un, who is one of the darkest and most evil leaders in the world. Trump does this because Trump admires Kim’s strength, his bullying, his ability to make opponents disappear into prison cells. The true leaders that Trump berated last week - do not do such things. They build constructive policies that work for their people, that provide trade and opportunities for all nations.Right now, around the world, every other leader is watching how Trump is behaving, watching that we USA citizens do not stop him, and understands that Trump is simply lauding Kim Jung-un, not demanding economic concessions from him, not demanding he create a sustainable, sane economy. As world leaders open their newspaper and check out news blogs, I’m sure they’re very quietly, deeply wondering how America’s stature can recover from such a brutal stunt, shunting aside fellow democratic leaders and embracing the leader that most represented the opposite of America - the opposite of what America was until January 2017.Every moment we allow this diminishing of America’s greatness, granting legitimacy and world standing to one of the worst leaders in the world, we make America look as petty and devoid of values as Donald Trump himself.Brutal and inhumane laws North Koreans are forced to live underLife in North Korea: executions, starvation and fearKim Jong-un's human rights record is among the world's worst Kim Jong Un is cruel and dangerous but not crazy, North Korean experts sayhttps://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/a-life-of-torture-starvation-and-executions-inside-north-korea-s-horrifyingly-cruel-prison-camps-8777170.htmlKim Jong Un's family: The bizarre, cruel world of North Korea's dynastyWorld Report 2017: Rights Trends in North KoreaThe Nightmare of Living in North KoreaNorth Korea human rights abuses resemble those of the Nazis, says UN inquiryhttps://www.indiatimes.com/news/world/did-you-know-kim-jong-un-has-executed-over-300-people-since-he-came-to-power-in-2011_-268383.html",24,1,39,71,0,10

1,Why does it seem that liberals have little representation in the Democratic party?,Liberal Democrats (UK politics),Liberalism (politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"Because all the good liberals are leaving the Democratic Party to become moderate republicans, libertarians, greens and independents. Ever since the 2016 election, the Democratic Party has been becoming more and more authoritarian and more regressive. They’re also in limbo where they define themselves by Trump rather than by policy. In other words, instead of “here’s our policy with North Korea, here’s our policy on taxes and here’s our policy on healthcare” it’s “we WILL impeach!” and “f**k the NRA”.The Democratic Party according to Hillary Clinton herself is about 40% socialist. The makeup of the Democratic Party is between socialists, centrists, progressives, liberals and the corporatist establishment. The liberals only really have stuff in common with the centrists. When you consider a working class democrat in small town Ohio who’s pro life and pro gun, they’re looking at the democrats right now trying to figure out exactly why they’re still a democrat. I mean they want to hear about lower taxes and more jobs and they see democrats dismissing job growth, blocking laws that would ban abortion after 24 weeks, attacking religious groups for freedom of association, insisting that every Trump voter is racist, etc. These are not conservative people at all. They want less spending on defence, they didn’t vote Trump, they want better social security they maybe want higher taxes on the rich, more regulations, higher minimum wage, they were never against gay marriage, they support things like affirmative action, against the death penalty, etc. They’re liberals. But they know when a party is going too far left. Hell, the CEO of Starbucks thinks the democrats are going too far left. STARBUCKS! As in “let’s close our storefronts to teach employees about racism” Starbucks CEO thinks the democrats are too left wing!I used to be a liberal. I identified with the democrats. I saw the democrats going waaay too left and got out. The party wasn’t what it’s followers claimed it to be and it was just going too far left. You’ve got prominent democrats supporting speech codes/hate speech laws, higher corporate taxes (despite all evidence showing it will mean less jobs) supporting ridiculous minimum wage laws (again, evidence shows minimum wage leads to less jobs), supporting caps on CEO pay, they’ve defended MS-13 against the label animals, something that a group that uses the motto “Kill, Rape, Control” absolutely are, etc. This party is run by charlatans who value power over the right thing, they have absolutely no fixed principles, they change their policies overnight to annoy conservatives, they completely ignore any and all advice on the economy, and we now know that they spy on their political opponents and have been known to weaponise the IRS against their political opponents, and all of this is without even discussing their problem with identity politics. Are the republicans much better? No, but they are better. So if you’re the moderate working class liberal I mentioned earlier, a lot of people like that are going to flee to the GOP or smaller parties over the next few years unless the democrats regain their sanity and working class credibility, something they’re seriously lacking right now.This is pretty much only the case with liberals. Progressives and socialists are not leaving the democrats any time soon. Why would they? They’re one bad election away from absolute power within the party. Liberals aren’t so lucky. The pecking order within the Democratic Party right now goes corporate democrats - progressives - socialists - liberals.

1,Why do Democrats claim to be the party that supports education when they support one-size-fits all solutions like Common Core?,False Beliefs,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"Common Core standards weren’t actually arbitrary educational achievement goals developed by the federal government.In fact, it was the National Council of State Legislatures and National Governors Association, two of the “Big 7” public policy organizations that represent state and local governments, that sponsored the development of these standards and continues to endorse the initiative with its granting of education licenses to schools.The only role played by any federal department in this initiative was the provision of research funding to evaluate the efficacy of these standards and the incentivization of states to adopt these standards, created by the states in the first place.As a matter of fact, immense flexibility is granted to local districts and teachers to facilitate the development of their curriculum.[1]But now the first part of your question, how does the Democratic Party claim to be the party of education?Simple, the Democratic party actually encourages funding of tested programs like the 21st Century Community Learning Center Initiative while the GOP actively tries to cut it.

1,Why do Democrats claim to be the party that supports education when they support one-size-fits all solutions like Common Core?,False Beliefs,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"I was in the Army. We were really big on training to a common standard so everyone could perform at least to a required level. It makes a lot of sense.I was privileged to see the recruit transformation process (a rather indifferent human goes in the front door, a much more impressive basic trained SOLDIER out the back) as both a victim and a trainer. They come from all across the country/schooling districts so there are always some problems getting everybody to a common starting level and not a lot of time to overcome these disparities. It would be a lot worse without a semblance of common standards most of which coming from school. A common (er) starting point makes a lot of sense.This is not just theory. I have also experienced foreign military students taking technical training. The ones from less developed countries without much prior experience with anything mechanical or electronic meant they had to be taught things like ‘left loosy, righty tighty’ - REALLY basic stuff. It would have been a lot better if they came with a common/standard set of skills/knowledge.Finally, you have to keep ‘score’ to know if you have ‘won’. You can’t come up with a meaningful score without a standard to measure against. Common core is a way of ensuring the basics get covered adequately. And common core is not higher education/calling which leads to life fulfillment or some such, it is more like learning to tie your shoes. At that level, one size does fit to make sure Johnny does not end up some not very employable dumb-ass.And I’ve seen young men (just the way it was back then) who clearly were very badly served by their prior education system(s). They may have had all the potential in the world but we only had a little time to fix them.

1,Why do Democrats claim to be the party that supports education when they support one-size-fits all solutions like Common Core?,False Beliefs,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"Actually, Common Core is far from “One size fits all.” Yes, the end result is supposed to be that everyone has reached a certain level of understanding, but GETTING there is all about individuality. (Tell me that it doesn’t make sense that a High School graduate in Harlem shouldn’t have the same BASIC knowledge as a hight school graduate in Beverly Hills). Look at the math, for instance. When people complain that the kids are being taught really strange ways of learning it- they are usually railing against ONE way that is being taught, while totally ignoring the other THREE ways that are being taught - all to reach the same answer. Once the children are taught that there are more than one ways to get there, the choice of which to use is up to the student. Unfortunately, we have math teachers that have decided they don’t like it, or they don’t understand it, and literally can’t teach it right. They then tell parents that the problem is the curriculum. (Never mind the fact that so many students, using the OLD way, couldn’t pass a basic math course - lining the pockets of colleges across the country who made new Freshman take “bonehead math” before they could even START their ACTUAL college program). Estimating, counting from the biggest numbers first, grouping, or column math - it’s all the same answer - THAT’S the point of core curriculum math.English - it’s about time we got away from everything being multiple choice. I had a child that was getting A’s in English because she could circle the adjectives and underline the nouns - but she couldn’t write an original paragraph about anything. When parents talk about the books that the children were being given to read, it was often left out that the children have a CHOICE of books. If there is a title or two in the list that the parents don’t like, tell the kids not to choose those.It is also a misstatement to say that schools were being forced to teach a particular curriculum. They were instructed to get kids to a certain point at a certain time. Certain material had to be included in order to ensure that there was commonality in education. (Again, the same BASIC or COMMON knowledge no matter what school was attended). The idea is, this list is the ‘core’ that must be taught to everyone. How you teach it is up to you. If you want to add to it, that’s fine too. The DOE, being a warehouse of knowledge and experience provided by teachers and institutions around the country, provided SAMPLE curriculums for schools that didn’t want to, or couldn’t create curriculums of their own. Once again, schools took the curriculums and, rather that make it their own, blamed the government for their inability to be educators.Now, there IS truth that individual teachers have been forced to teach a curriculum they didn’t devise. That’s not the fault of “common core.” It’s the fault of the school districts who didn’t embrace the ideals, educate their educators, and modify/devise curriculums that their teachers would support. They just grabbed a book and a checklist that had “common core approved” stamped on it, and told their teachers they would teach it.So now you tell me…what is more supportive of education:Allowing every school to teach what and how they want, resulting in some schools having very successful students while some schools are just plain horrible. Allowing schools to simply pass kids who aren’t ready, graduate kids whose only REAL success was that they sat in classrooms for 12 years, and allowing schools to teach things that just simply weren’t supported and/or were harmful to social unity.ORRequring every school to teach to a result - that the vast majority of students know a base level of information at every measuring point along the way. Creating those common measuring points. Providing assistance to schools who require and ask for it by sharing curriculums and funding. Making schools and individual teachers actually responsible for the results of their teaching practices.",46,2,124,"1,093",0,0

3,Has a democratic socialist state ever existed?,Democratic Socialism,Socialism,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,"Wallace B. McClure’s answer pretty much nailed it. As he mentioned, Scandinavian and some other countries in Europe are NOT democratic socialist states. What confuses people is that those countries have social democratic governments. That simply means that those governments promote a mixed economy that includes both capitalism when it comes to commerce where profit makes sense and socialism for social services that benefit society. Tax revenue is used to pay for the latter. Investors finance the former.As long as both are well regulated and corruptions is kept to a minimum, this works very well. It results in a high standard of living and a generally content population. The United States had a reasonably successful social democratic government following World War II. It still benefits from tax funded infrastructure built during that time.Needless to say, corruption took control. President Eisenhower warned of this danger in 1961 during his final public address. By the end of the decade, it was clear that Americans had not heeded the warning.Democratic socialism, on the other hand, is intended to be a pathway to capital “S” Socialism where the government controls the production of things and provides all services.

3,Has a democratic socialist state ever existed?,Democratic Socialism,Socialism,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,"I take your question to mean ”Has a socialist state that practised true democracy ever existed?’ To that question I’d reply simply, ‘Not yet, and perhaps never’.But the problem, as usual, is to agree on a definition of our terms. As an idealist by personality and also in practice - to my own cost, I think a truly democratic socialist society would be democratic ‘all the way down’, ie there would be no hierarchical structures at all: in the family, the community, the educational system, the workplaces, the legislature, the justice system, and there would definitely not be a small group with executive power to colonise or to declare war on another country.And in such a democratic socialist society there would be personal property but no ‘private property’ or government property, and any leadership structure formed to remedy a particular situation would be fluid and temporary. At all other times everyone could participate in reaching solutions that prioritised the needs of the many rather than the few, but took into account any specific needs, eg disability or natural disaster etc.By these definitions such a state would have trouble surviving in a world like today. And indeed, there is evidence to suggest that throughout history (and perhaps before history?) societies that were quite democratic in my terms did not survive.On the continent now called Australia in 1770 there were apparently between 250 and 500 different societies that seem to have sorted out how to live simply and sustainably, and to keep out of each other’s way most of the time over the course of around 65,000 years. They lasted that long because of their geographical isolation from would-be colonisers.But all that changed when Captain James Cook, on secret orders from the British government (at war with France at the time), charted most of the east coast and claimed it, on behalf of the British crown, as the colony of New South Wales. Eighteen years later came the first colony, based in Sydney Cove, and by 1901 the separate colonies founded around the coast in the meantime were united in the Commonwealth of Australia.I apologise for detailing this take-over but I hope it serves to illustrate just how fragile any society that chooses not to establish rigid hierarchies with executive power is. In order for any truly democratic and socialist states to survive today the whole world order would need to change. And I don’t hold out much hope for that . . . .",62,0,7,224,0,0

North Korea is a dictatorship complete with prison camps and the regular execution of those considered opponents — even when they’re family members.

The Iran deal took 10 years (and more than one president), given the complexity of verifying compliance with nuclear agreements. Trump seems to have zero understanding of this fact. The technical aspects of the Iran deal were led by Obama’s Secretary of Energy, who has a PhD in the subject matter.

Because achieving peace on the Korean Peninsula would be nothing short of a miracle and certainly garnish a Nobel Peace Prize for Presidents Trump and Moon, and likely as well for Kim Jong-un. That is unacceptable to Democrats who are willing to put party and personal ambitions over national and world interests. What we are seeing, sadly, is the two tiered morality being practiced by Democrats, or I should say the most radical Leftist element which has captured the Democratic Party being practiced in terms of rabid realpolitik.I was originally a Democrat for nearly my entire adult life, but became an independent with the election and abuses of power under the Obama Administration, violating the US Constitution and ignoring the separation of power imbued in our Constitution, acting more like a dictator and monarch than an elected official sworn to uphold the Constitution. I am not so much a social conservative as a financial conservative now, because I see the politicians in Washington, DC riding roughshod over our Bill of Rights and the Constitution for political and personal gain—like it has been for decades. So when Donald Trump promised to “drain the swamp” and has set out on a bold effort to keep his campaign promises—a rarity in today’s politics—and is really interested in returning America to greatness and its leadership role in the world, I voted for a change.I would prefer certain domestic policies had not been promoted but in reality they are the basis of the Republican Party’s core political philosophy so we have to accept that Republicans would want lesser government, less control by government (especially the federal government) over individuals, the economy and state’s rights. Of course the Republican Establishment are typically free trade proponents and capitalists at their core, but Trump is different. He has opposed mega-mergers as being anti-competitive and monopolistic. He has a real concern that the United States is losing its industrial base, and with it the economic security we need to keep a strong middle class. He also sees the need to reinvigorate the US economy and return factories and jobs to America as a national security imperative, of which I agree. And he sees the hypocrisy of supposed allies who themselves erect horrible trade barriers for US goods and services by either imposing high protective tariffs, restrictions in importation quotas, or create phony certification processes which are specifically geared to protect their domestic industries and prohibit US exports. That is trade protectionism, but its their trade protectionism against US workers and American companies.Having been in commerce and international trade at the highest levels during my years as a senior executive or entrepreneur, I know firsthand how the rest of the world has taken advantage of the generosity of the US after WWII when the US made real progress in restoring the global economy, including of defeated enemies, namely Germany, Italy and Japan. As well as helping to rebuild Europe through the Marshall Plan. But our allies got greedy. President Trump knows the history of how America went from a global industrial juggernaut to losing almost every one of its technological advantages and industries to overseas competitors who used unfair trade practices, put America at a disadvantage with unfair mercantile trade policies, outright theft of not only critical defense classified secrets, but commercial intellectual property for which they have used their intelligence services to steal trade secrets at the expense of American companies and jobs.This president is going to level the playing field just like he said he would, despite fascists posing as progressive Democrats, who are using every dirty trick to try to thwart the will of the electorate with their “paid for” and “planted” phony Steele dossier and Russia collusion narrative. They should stop shouting falsehoods; either “put up” and produce the evidence, or shut up and go home to sulk for the losses they are about to experience as a rebuke to their shenanigans, not just in the midterm elections, but in the 2020 Presidential reelection campaign. Traditional backers of the Democratic Party: African and Hispanic Americans, labor unions and their blue collar workers, coal miners, etc. are realizing the Democrats did nothing to help them out when President Obama held the office for eight unproductive years. They actually suffered under the Democratic president and his failed policies. This president is a non-political businessman, elected as a “people’s”President. He has done more for minorities and blue collar workers, and the middle class, in his first year in office than Obama did in eighth years—even with the distraction of a bogus Russian collusion witch hunt, Democratic obstructionism, and their slow walking his nominations through the Senate in blatant obstruction so he is denied confirmation of his choices to assist him in his administration and on the bench. Democrats have made every attempt at open “resistance” as they put it, but it is more akin to open rebellion—just look at sanctuary cities and state officials who thwart the legal authority of law enforcement trying to uphold federal law! That is not just illegal, as far as the application of the law goes, it is downright treasonous. The short of it is that the progressive wing of the Democrat Party has hijacked the moderate majority side of the Democratic Party and installed a socialist, leftist agenda. They are sabotaging every effort by this president to lead the nation. They are totally bent on thwarting the will of the electorate who voted President Trump and the Republicans into power. They are NOT reaching out to find national unity through political compromise for the good of the nation. And for that reason, they are now trying to nix any agreement Trump brings back from Singapore with North Korea. The irony is that if this had been Obama, who pushed the Iran agreement through without Congressional approval of the Senate as is required for treaties, they would applaud the effort. While President Trump has stated that any understanding obtained he would present to the US Senate for a vote to approve it as a legal treaty. What a difference between the way Obama ruled by executive resolution without the will of the Congress being consider as required by the US Constitution—that is why his illegal policies are being overturned by the US Supreme Court as being an unconstitutional abuse of the power of the Executive.",252,4,319,935,0,0

Trump pulled out of the Iran Deal because it was not severe enough in his mind. So it would stand to reason that his Korean Deal should be much, much tougher than Iran’s.Second, Iran is a theocratic democracy that lacks the types of human rights abuses that North Korea indulges in. The DPRK is an absolute dictatorship.Third Iran wasn’t trading with us or much of anyone really. They were oddly self sufficient beyond oil exports to Russia and China. North Korea on the other hand is a black market state that is the world’s leading supplier of fentanyl, crystal methamphetimine, several dangerous designer hallucinogens, small arms and explosives, as well as military ordinance for black market arms dealers. In short they are the source of our worst drugs and about 1/3 of most terrorist organizations light weapons and most of their mortars and artillery.Iran sponsors several terrorist groups like Hamas and Hezbollah. Both of which function as external Sh’ia political parties. They pick favorites. The DPRK will sell to literally anyone with a couple of bucks.Iran was fighting ISIS. Indeed they were doing the lions share alongside the Peshmurga while our other regional allies dithered.There were certainly issues with the JCPOA but that plan incorporated the entire UN Security Council and lowered the price of gas at our pumps.So what is the outline for Trump’s plan in North Korea? All we have heard is total denuclearization but virtually no one thinks that is really likely. By “no one” I mean the security experts who’ve spent years on this topic.Trump is deliberately trying to shut out other states on the negotiation and it looks like China is dealing behind his back, surprise surprise. This is very different than the JCPOA that had China, France, Russia, Germany, the UK, Japan and ten other countries interlinked in the agreement.Iran was apparently abiding by the deal.North Korea has historically broken every deal they’ve ever made with every foreign government that’s tried.Trump’s own National Security Advisor, John Bolton, deliberately tried to scuttle the talks with his “Libya Model” remarks. That comes from Trump’s State Department.So Trump might should listen to his critics here because if he gives away the farm and signs a weak deal he is going to get blasted from every side. Unlike most everything else, this is not a partisan domestic political issue and virtually everyone will have an opinion on the outcome. By everyone I mean the UN, the Security Council members, every significant foreign Head of State, the entire non-proliferation movement, the US military, John Bolton, the Neo Cons, the Neo Liberals, Iran, our entire National Security Community as well as those of our closest allies, Shinzo Abe, President Moon and the Nobel Committee. That last one may not even consider him if it’s a bum deal.There is a sense that Trump May want this too much. That desire might just cloud his judgement because we have yet to see any masterful deal making on his part and he’s had some opportunities.I hope this turns out well but I could easily see this going sideways still. It almost has twice. Considering he pulled out of JCPOA I’m not sure how he is going to get a better deal that’s more forceful since at the moment it is the US that is fickle and can’t hold up a bargain.I should also point out that the toughest criticisms I’ve heard and read have come from the more Conservative end of the Political Spectrum.

It really reads like you’ve written “I think democrats are hypocrites for praising the JCPOA and but criticizing Trump and attempting to make a deal with North Korea…so let’s add a question mark to the end of this sentence and post it.”First, I don’t think Democrats are being “very tough” about Trump and North Korea. Here are some facts to keep in mind:—North Korea is a failed state. They kill thousands of their people yearly. They make most of their hard currency off of synthetic illicit drugs, illegal arms sales, selling brides to China, and some of the best counterfeiting of US dollars (the so-called “super-bill”) in the world. They don’t just violate human rights, they don’t recognize any human rights in their country. They assassinate people on foreign soil and also kidnap a range of people that their leadership has decided must die. They routinely threaten violence and war and they’ve violated a wide range of UN and nuclear proliferation standards. North Korea wants to be recognized as an “equal” on the world stage. To meet with them face-to-face is a “win” for North Korea, even if nothing comes out of it. To North Korea it will validate everything they’ve done and how they’ve acted b/c it shows they can be a terrible country with bad leaders and yet still get treated like everyone else. That does NOT mean we should never meet with North Korea. It does mean that we need to get something out of meeting with them b/c we’ve handed them a victory to their nation just by considering to have a summit.—It’s the GOP that criticized the JCPOA by saying that it didn’t address Iran’s actions as a “bad actor”…human rights violations, efforts to violate UN sanctions, efforts to foment violence and aggression. It’s the GOP that set that standard. It would reek of hypocrisy to kill the JCPOA by saying “it only addressed Iran’s nuclear program” but then choose to ignore all of the bad actions by North Korea and focus only on their nuclear program. I’m not arguing we shouldn’t take that approach, only pointing out that it’s the GOP that are being the hypocrites here.—I think a number of people (not just democrats) are critical of Trump with North Korea b/c they see him as naive and unprepared for any kind of interaction with North Korea. Maybe we’re all wrong—maybe what Kim Jong-un required was someone to do some major saber-rattling, call him “little rocket man” and then eagerly sit down to a meeting. I personally think that Trump is a terrible fit for these kinds of negotiations (the North Koreans are willing to spend years arguing over the size of the negotiating table: Why negotiating with North Korea is fraught with risk )—Trump is eager to say “I did something Obama didn’t do” and reach an agreement with North Korea. If we can achieve a meaningful agreement with North Korea that decreases the likelihood of war, I’ll praise that—I truly will. But here’s what Donald Trump and many of his supporters don’t get: North Korea sees “denuclearization” as the US pulling all troops out of South Korea, removing all possible nuclear delivery systems (so no air bases, no naval visits) out of the theater (so this would also include Japan). And Trump has already said he sees no reason why we shouldn’t pull our conventional forces out of South Korea. This is how we get another Korean War.Finally, let’s address the basic implied assumption that the JCPOA was flawed and the democrats are being inconsistent here. The JCPOA did a very good job of a couple of things: providing access to Iran’s programs and delaying them for 7 years. Judged by those elements it was an excellent deal. That’s not just my opinion: Israel’s general staff concluded after the deal that Iran’s nuclear program was no longer Israel’s #1 security threat (in fact it didn’t even make their list of security threats). Israel’s security chiefs concluded that the deal enhanced Israel’s security and gave them a level of access they didn’t have. Was it perfect? Depends upon your standards. It absolutely didn’t address conventional issues (Hamas, Hezbollah, Quods covert operations). It didn’t permanently ban nuclear activity—only went out for 7 years. Some people saw those as major flaws. Frankly though, I think that Netanyahu and Trump are not interested in any kind of deal with Iran. I think they are both deluded in to believing that the US will be able to restore sanctions to the Obama levels (which I don’t think they can—Russia and China won’t join for sure and the price of oil is climbing) and that with the sanctions, Iran’s economy will collapse and the regime will be replaced by a democracy. That was also the theory with Syria (which doesn’t have oil money like Iran does)…how’s that working with Syria?My take is that the whole “JCPOA is a flawed agreement” is basically a BS stance. The real opponents see all agreements with Iran as flawed (unless you assume Iran will agree to ban nuclear development for ever and also stop all conventional mischief—and that will never happen b/c once you’ve developed nuclear capability, you always have the know-how, the scientists to restart to irreversible and permanent ban isn’t possible to guarantee). No, the real opponents to the JCPOA don’t want any kind of deal with Iran and they are gambling that they can get Iran’s economy to collapse and that in the rubble of a new Iran, a democracy will emerge. That’s quite a gamble. If the Iranian economy doesn’t collapse. Or if the regime doesn’t collapse. Or if it collapses and is replaced by something even worse (I know, that would NEVER happen—right?) then what we have is a missed opportunity and a nuclear Iran that is still involved in conventional mischief.The whole comparison between Iran and North Korea is one created by the GOP. By criticizing the JCPOA, the GOP effectively set a standard that implies that any successful North Korean deal needs to be better than the JCPOA. The arguments against the JCPOA were mostly artificial BS and that standard the GOP has accidentally created is also a BS one—the two situations are different. If we can get a meaningful agreement with North Korea then that’s worth trying for.And last of all, Obama didn’t lie about the JCPOA. In fact, it was under an amazing level of scrutiny. Netanyahu was leaking information about the negotiations to any he thought might sabotage it. Multiple countries and their governments were involved. Do you honestly think that if Obama had lied, a GOP Congress would have failed to initiate impeachment proceedings? Claiming Obama lied about the JCPOA is right-wing hyperbole.",9.1k,315,698,"2,070",0,1

Infrastructure was being developed just fine without Government involvement. The Government doesn’t need to tell Intel to invest billions in their lab infrastructure to produce each generation of chip.

Other states such as California, Texas, New York, and Florida may fit that mold. There is also the question of racial and religious tribalism that inevitably results in wars.Before jumping right into dissolving the state governments with a preference to somewhat autonomous governments tied to judicial districts, perhaps some other arrangement might be superior. Like the south might be allowed to secede as was the intent that brought the civil war, or states might enter into compacts that would PREDICT judicial districts. The point I wish to make is that judicial districts and the interpretation of law will have been the tie that binds any real society. Viewed in this fashion, the end of federalism would probably be accomplished by dissolving the Supreme Court. That would allow no appeal above the regional districts regarding the interpretation of law. Same sex marriage, abortion, and segregation would be decided regionally.As to centralized law and military, each region would pay according to population and how the region itself gathered the funds with which to pay would be at the discretion of the region.So this answer is intended to offer an example of “federal system” that is quite different from the current.",117,1,83,"1,313",0,1

6,Why do states with the least amount of wealth vote Republican?,Voting,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"This is only speculation on my part, but “least amount of wealth” is a very subjective term. For example, those “least wealthy” states also have the lowest cost of living (check out rents and other housing costs). Low cost of living lowers GDP and that skews things a little. The bigger deal is that those states have lower populations overall, and that especially means lower urban populations.Urban populations usually vote Democrat while rural populations vote Republican, though there are a few exceptions. Why is that? This is where I resort to opinion.First, a farmer or rancher with his/her own well and septic tank, a garden and crops or livestock, is far more independent of government than a city dweller who uses public water systems, sewage systems, transportation systems, and even traffic lights to get to work. Cops are few and far between for rural folks so they actually NEED to be able to protect themselves with guns far more than any “New York liberal” can imagine, and they use guns to hunt, to keep predatory critters away from their cattle (and deer away from their crops) and to just “plink” on their own land where they endanger NOBODY. Democrats REALLY need to think about that!Urban dwellers, on the other hand, are so dependent on government services every day and in every way that they see the benefits of actually having government far more than farmers do. But there is another factor. Farmers and other rural people tend to be homogenous in race and religion and even a particular European ancestry, in each region, and they never even meet (many) people of other religions, races, and nationalities. Since they don’t interact with them, they don’t get to know and like them.

Aggressive confrontation of violent gangs and terrorist groups. Reducing the size of the government and forcing more accountability. Appointed more constitutionally inclined circuit court judges in his first year than any president in history. Removed communist medical care mandate from the already broken backs of American workers. Making healthcare more affordable and accessible for those who protect our nation instead of those who burden it. Pissing off liberals at an unprecedented volume with pro-American actions and real results. I personally feel that these are all positive things, although I’m sure there are many who would disagree. Those who do are typically the same people you will see slandering the president and his family, vilifying patriotism, desecrating the symbols of our liberty, delegitimizing our history and culture, attempting to subvert our way of life, remove our constitutional rights, and stealing our money. This is what I see with my own eyes. And so do all of the true Americans who support our president. Trump will be re-elected in 2020. Believe it.",78,3,1,15,0,0

Those two split the GOP vote somewhat. But on the Democratic side, there were at least 5 with serious campaigns.

Had one of the 4 managed even 50% of the non-Gavin Newsom, non-GOP vote, he would have finished in the #2 spot.So, to say it more simply, the GOP vote was concentrated while the Democratic vote was distributed. That's how a Republican ended up only 6 points out of first place.Don't expect the same in November when there will be only 2 candidates on the ballot, one Democratic, one GOP.

As much as they oppose Trump’s corruption, I view them as people who would quickly instate their own brand of the same if given a position to do so. Every single one of them is, at least in my present view, a MacBeth type to a tee.

There’s a pathological inability to relate to the other side that holds them back, but this is not unique to American Democrats, being more endemic in American civil discourse today (something encouraged by the leadership of both political parties).There’s too much of an urge though, I think, to believe that simply throwing more government funding at problems will fix them, and so modern Democrats fail where midcentury Democrats had more success: actually planning solutions appropriately and then executing them, rather than just writing a big ol’ checkaroo paid to the order of insert-current-problem-here, or establishing yet another “Federal Alphabet Soup” agency that ultimately becomes a waste of taxpayer funds and may or may not actually do anything (and if they do, it may or may not actually tie in with their original purpose).TL;DR version:Democrats are keenly aware of what the problems are in America today, probably more aware than the Republicans. This works in their favor. Unfortunately, they have very little imagination as regards fixing these problems, and simply believe that “more execution of Government” as opposed to “proper and responsible execution of Government” will fix most problems.

18,What do you think of Republicans?,Republican National Committee (RNC),1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"I have to firstly declare that I am not American and have no voting rights in America. I have however, lived in America and worked at a hospital near Boston as a physiotherapist in the early 90s. I have also travelled to America numerous times and have relatives living in California, Colorado and NYC.My impression of Republicans, as someone looking in from the outside, is that they have persistently through their ideological worldview, brought about the demise of their own society. This is a very sad state of affairs when you consider that America has been a leading light in the world in terms of human rights, social and economic reforms and many other advancements in the field of science and medicine as well as the arts. No longer. In the seventies, American wages were still tied to production. In other words, as companies became more profitable, workers entitlements and wages also grew. For reasons too many to discuss here (rising oil costs, changing economic models such as ‘trickle down effect’ etc), Republican ideals began to move towards a more hard line model of free market dominance over paying people a decent living wage. Reagan (and Thatcher) pushed the line that if we let people at the top of the economic food chain do as they pleased without constraint, they would get very wealthy and some of that wealth would ‘trickle down’ to the rest of us. Fast forward to today and we can see how that has played out. Fantastic for the top one percent. Lousy for the rest of the population.Wages have not gone up in any meaningful way for at least forty years in America. Basic workers rights and entitlements have been almost completely eroded. You can work your arse off in two jobs and still not make the rent AND buy food. Let alone have access to healthcare or education as a means of climbing up the social ladder. Most workers in America are more or less doomed to their lot from the moment they are born. People love all those feel good stories about how someone from a poor background became rich and successful. I think you have more chance of being struck by lightning than becoming successful and wealthy in America IF you are not already born into wealth. Hence the American Dream remains just that, a dream, a fantasy and a Republican tool to keep poor people oblivious to the reality of their lives. Time to get WOKE people.I have been travelling to America since the mid eighties and each time I visit, I can visibly see the effects of hard right economic Republican policies. Hard to believe I know but in the eighties, I was able to wander the streets of San Fransisco with barely a homeless person in sight. Its so bad today that the city of SF has to seriously consider how to deal with the effects of thousands of homeless people without access to toilets defecating and urinating on the streets.I saw the effects of Republican policies on healthcare when I lived and worked in a hospital in Massachussets. I was shocked at the cost of healthcare on the average person. We had friends who were middle class professionals who owned their own home and worked full time in good jobs almost go bankrupt when one of them got cancer and they couldnt afford to pay for his treatment. The house had to be sold to fund his treatment. That was in the nineties when healthcare was far less expensive than it is today. I really believe the measure of the health of a society’s individual reflects the health of the whole society.What have the Republicans got to do with this? Back then, Hillary Clinton was trying to establish a more universal system of healthcare even though she was only the first lady. She was not only obstructed but villified by Republicans. Coming from Australia where our GDP is a third the size of California’s (with the same population as ours), I was profoundly shocked that a little country like Australia can afford to give free or affordable healthcare to its people while America, the richest nation on earth, seemingly doesnt give a shit if Americans are sick or die from lack of access to healthcare. I was there when George W Bush refused to sign a bill granting basic health care to CHILDREN! What does it say about a society that doesnt care if its children can access doctors or basic things such as vaccinations? The really sick part of it is that the health of America’s future labour force will determine its economic success, or not. It makes no economic sense to not look after your people therefore I can only conclude that Republican ideology (ie. you have to pay for everything you use including your education and healthcare) trumps all economic common sense. The countries with the highest standards of living are consistently those that look after and provide fundamental access to health and education for its people.I experienced this on a personal daily level working in the hospital in boston. Workers who had been injured at work were given minimal care and basically thrown on the heap if they were not well enough to return to work. Wealth, even back then, was the single biggest determining factor of wether you were looked after or not if you were sick or injured. And this is certainly the way that Republicans manipulated the healthcare industries with their policies. I believe it is even worse today.I was chatted up in a club one night by a man who told me he was the son of a Republican senator (as though that was a turn on!). He then proceeded to tell me that the reason anyone in America was poor was because they were STUPID! Well stupid would be an understatement for that remark! Either he had no idea of the structures and systems manipulated by Republican politicians over the decades that function to keep poor people in their place or he was himself, genuinely STUPID.The saddest part about the Republican model is that, by creating the huge inequalities between people who have wealth and can therefore access health and education and whatever else they desire, and those who have no means to escape their poverty, is that they have created a society few would want to live in.Our living situation was a microcosm of that society. We lived in a house on a street halfway up a hill surrounded by middle class neighbours. At the bottom of the street lived the poor (mainly African Americans and Puerto Ricans) in ramshackle homes and at the top of the hill lived the wealthy in their gated mansions with security guards and dogs. I would frighten the hell out of my colleagues by telling them that I walked to work. They told me not to as it was too dangerous to do so. It wouldn’t matter to me how wealthy I became if I could no longer safely walk up or down my own street. This is not a country worth living in. Your material assets can never compensate for the lack of real freedom from your fear of what people might do because they are driven to desperate measures by their own circumstances. Poverty leads to crime and poverty for the masses in America has been the driving ideology of the Republican party for as long as I can remember. That’s reason enough not to like the bastards.o",455,31,5,1,0,0
18,What do you think of Republicans?,Republican National Committee (RNC),1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"I hate the modern Republican Party. I don’t think it has any redeeming qualities right now. It is all bad.I don’t hate individual Republicans. I respect some. I do not respect the decision to vote for Trump and I won’t tell even people I love otherwise ( if they ask.) I think almost every Republican I know who voted for Trump has shown poor judgement & priorities and a level of depraved indifference that I find devestating. No, this is not an unforgiveable offense. No, I don’t think we are too far gone. No, the opposition to Hillary Clinton was not a mystery.The Republican Party, however, looked like for a minute that it was going to consider a brokered convention. But they chose not to. Having their policies put into effect was more important. They did what they thought was the best for the country they say. I take them at their word. For that reason, I do not believe it is rational for me or anyone else to trust their judgement or their priorities. I don’t call all Trump supporters racist. I never have.

I have told them to avoid talking about it at school or with people. Just avoid it. If is too volatile and at times it is dangerous. Trump supporters have felt socially ostracized? I no longer work there, but I felt 100 percent uncomfortable answering workplace political questions at one hospital I was doing per diem work. These are strange times.Here is what I have told my kids & what I try to do myself: focus on what we have in common as Americans, as people. I think that can help.I have never cared for the policies, culture & rhetoric of the Republican Party.Basically, I have always seen the party as a bizarre hybrid of religious imperialism & arrogance, obsession with sexual rules to the point of perversion, corporatists & warhawks.These views goes back to my days in high school. I grew up in a Republican county north of Detroit. I also attended a second tier state university & completed a course of study where “ the left” in no way dominated campus life or my courses.So, please know my dislike for the Republican Party is not rooted in a lack of exposure & familiarity with Republican ideology.My views of the party took a steep dive with the election of George W. Bush. A theme then was the “ US needed a CEO & someone who thought like a businessman. “ What kind of dystopian goal is that?Then like a Frankenstein monster, they also listed Bush’s Christianity as a qualification. Isn’t that just like so many Republicans? Jesus & Business. I don’t know if it is hubris or delusion, but Americans were being asked to actually believe that this President was going to promote a culture of life. During his tenure as Governor of Texas, there was an unprecedented amount of executions. I get it, some states have the death penalty. I don’t get how FOND of the death penalty some states are. I live in a state where there never has been one, and that state borders Canada, which did away with the death penalty because or rising concerns of mistakes in trials. During the Bush governorship, several other governors suspended execution in the light of new information about DNA exonerations. Not Bush. He kept going. Then he promised his base federal monies in the form of faith based intiatives. He exploited Terri Schaivo to make a point, and he didn’t get his facts straight.What do I think about Republicans? I think their constant sloganeering that they love America is totally meaningless.I resent their religious arrogance and their lack of hesitation to use Christianity to divide and oppress. They are not the only Christians and I am so royally sick of their shit on that issue. This isn’t new. I felt that way when I was 16 and was a practicing Christian.By the way, I mean every word of what I am saying and it doesn’t feel good. My disgust for the GOP isn’t all moral. I don’t think many of the people they elect are incompetent. Lack of curiosity plagues the GOP.None of this should be construed as an assertion that I think the shit of the Democrat Party doesn’t stink. It sure does.Republicans chose party over country. The chose to ignore & deny racism for decades & they still do. The pander to the persecution and fiction of conservative white Southerners and their civil war nonsense. For Pete’s sake, there are people in office that still deny that the South wanted to preserve slavery. At times, they have employed identity politics on a scale that dwarves that of the left.I still cannot believe that Clive Bundy & company pointed guns army federal officers but they see show almost no interest in addressing issues for people who die in policy custody.I can remember all the rhetoric of Ronald Reagen, his pithy jokes about the government coming to help.

18,What do you think of Republicans?,Republican National Committee (RNC),1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"I think they have a different set of tribal loyalties. That’s basically the crux of it. We all have tribal loyalties. And it’s always easier for us to be sympathetic to the concerns of our in-group and unsympathetic to those of our out-group.If you’re a Republican, your in-group consists of:Conservative Christians.Gun enthusiasts.The military.Rich people.When policies are proposed, you will generally be counted on to oppose them if they harm the perceived interests of those groups, even if you yourself aren’t a member of that specific group. Thus, if someone tells me that they think there is a war on Christmas, I can immediately expect them to be sympathetic to the NRA and to support high levels of military spending. I can also suspect that this person will be unsympathetic to feminism and to Black Lives Matter. It is also unlikely that such a person will accept anthropogenic global warming.These ideas are not logically related, though you could fit a certain logic to them if you tried. In actuality, much like Andrew Jackson’s anti-national-bank and pro-indian-removal policies, loyalty to the party and to one’s in-group leads to support for specific policies rather than the reverse. This is my view of the Republicanism of the masses. It’s the dynamic that leads to things like Trump’s 90% approval rating among Republicans, even though many intellectual conservatives once upon a time had huge reservations about supporting him.Now, even though I’ve listed many sub-groups of the Republican coalition, when you look at the leadership of the party, its number one priority, for as far back as my political memory goes, has been to pass policies that benefit the wealthiest. This was evident in Bush’s tax cuts. It was evident when the party shut down the government because Obama didn’t want to make the tax cuts for the richest among us permanent, and it’s been evident in the horrendous tax law passed last year. In fact, it’s the one thing that the party will never under any circumstance sacrifice to any other priority.The result of this stance is that whenever the interests of the population conflict with those of corporations, you can count on the Republican Party to side with the latter. You can see this in the opposition to even the mildest forms of financial reforms, which sought to prevent banks from ripping off their customers. You can also see this in hostility to environmental regulation, even when such regulation is concerned with keeping our air and water clean.One more thing needs to be said about the Republicanism of the masses. Along with tribal loyalties come tribal antagonisms. For instance, in American politics, it’s impossible to appeal to both Blacks and a certain sort of White conservatives. It wasn’t possible in the 1860s. It wasn’t possible in the 1960s. And it’s certainly not possible now. And ever since Nixon, the Republican Party has been hugely adept at appealing to the negrophobic vote. Trump has taken this to a much more explicit level than we have seen in recent memory, but you can see versions of the same thing in Bush II’s dirty campaign of insinuating that McCain had fathered a black child, in Bush I’s Willie Horton ad, and in Reagan’s Neshoba County Fair’s campaign speech.As you can tell from the above, Republicans are very much part of my political out-group.

0,Why are liberals and democrats the only people who care about the poor?,The Idiot Annonymous Troller STRIKES AGAIN!,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Original question: Why are liberals and democrats the only people who care about the poor?Most of the answers on this thread are wrong. The only correct answers I see thus far are from Phil Jones and Francis Dickinson.There are plenty of individuals, in both “conservative” and “liberal” camps, who care about the poor. And, contrary to the misinformed conservative answers here, liberals donate to charity just as much as conservatives do.[1] I have lost track of the number of times I’ve had to shoot down this stupid myth about conservatives being more generous than liberals. It isn’t true, and it needs to die a long-overdue death.But “caring about the poor” doesn’t just mean contributing personally to charity and humanitarian aid for the less fortunate. It also means understanding what poverty is and the systematic causes of it. It means being able to offer solutions which address those systematic causes. And it means using whatever tools you have at your disposal to implement those solutions, regardless of whether those tools are public or private.It is in this regard that many liberals and Democrats have a better understanding of how to deal with poverty than many self-professed conservatives. Modern liberals (some use the label “progressive”) are well-aware of the various shortcomings of voluntary private charity in dealing with systematic poverty. For example:Private charity is often guilty of manipulation and discrimination against religious, ethnic, and sexual minorities,Private charity often shrinks in times of crisis — at the very time it needs to expand[2] , andPrivate charity is simply not sufficient to deal with large-scale structural poverty.[3]Liberals and Democrats recognize the value of private charity, but they don’t think it is capable of helping the poor all on its own. Private charity does not replace the need for public social safety nets.Footnotes[1] https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.docu...[2] The Voluntarism Fantasy[3] Amazon.com: The Limits of Voluntarism: Charity and Welfare from the New Deal through the Great Society (9780521889575): Andrew J.

The differences are the belief or disbelieve that life is a zero sum game, and there is some genuine disagreement on how best to help the poor.Once you eliminate all the dregs, and consider only thoughtful liberals and conservatives, I think the primary difference comes down to the following: does helping supply help the poor more or does helping demand. Conservatives believe the trick is helping supply. Give money to the people who supply the goods and services and that will create a job rich environment that will help the poor. We know there are issues with that.Liberals, on the other hand, feel helping the demand side of the equation is better. The thinking being that if supply has more money, they will buy more product and that will boost demand.I’m a liberal, but I’m not a 100% believer in either. I do think the second of the two is what is missing today and Reaganomics is the cause of our current ills. But, while there is no doubt Keynesianism worked wonders, it was not a panacea and ultimately led to inflation and job loss. My personal thought is our mistake is thinking these ideas are “Philosophies” instead of just tools. When you have a nail, you pick up the hammer. When you have a screw, you pick up the screwdriver.

But they just couldn't help it - the story closed with the quotes of a Trump supporter who is “fed up” with the scandals, Trump's language, etc. God forbid they run what might be perceived as a pro-Trump article.I read an NBC article today about Trump and North Korea, written by Andrea Mitchell. She could not write a straight article just about the facts. I was actually interested in reading about Kim backing down from agreeing to denuclearize. But Mitchell couldn't help but use multiple pejoratives describing Trump. She had to say that he was egotistical, weak, a braggart. I can't even remember all the negatives terms she used to describe the President. If this had been an article about Obama meeting with Kim, and Kim not keeping his word, she would have, I'm sure, described how heroic and strong Obama was and what a sleazeball Kim is.

I wound up rolling my eyes and walking away even though I was initially interested in reading the story.But the left doesn't even realize what they are doing and how they are turning people off with the constant put downs and disrespect of the President.

In order for anyone to continue to support Trump at this point, they must construct a reality where this flaming circus-trainwreck of an administration's many flaws do not exist. Where its financial and ethical conflicts of interest, incompetent decisions, ridiculously unqualified appointments, naked profiteering, derelictions of duty, betrayals of allies, gaslighting of the public, undermining of institutions, obstruction of justice, destabilization of international relations, disruption of markets, and abdication of American global leadership are all “fake news”.It's simply impossible for reasoned arguments to land in such an environment.Imagine a person stubbornly in denial about the fact that they’re knee-deep in gasoline, even as you frantically yell at them not to light that match. “How dare you insult my intelligence!?

Or is the circulation of insults bilateral?Suppose that insults were to cease, and that people switched to engaging one another, would minds be changed?Is the level of vitriol present in politics currently more than at previous times during our history?You and I might arrive at different conclusions. But I will let you know my opinions.There are two types of people who voted for Trump: pragmatic Republicans and believers in Trumpism. The latter have so little in common with liberal that they largely evolve in different circles. They don’t talk to each other. They don’t know each other. Liberals know that those people exist, but they are always puzzled that there could be so many of them. The former group comprises a lot of people who are not excited about Trump himself, but who realized that, whatever his problematic behaviors and pronouncements might be, he would give them 90+% of their preferred policy agenda. I find myself able to talk to this group. The other group? What is there to say. It is all I can do to doff my hat, smile, and wish them good luck in future elections.I have seen plenty of insults from conservatives directed at liberals: libtards, snowflakes, Demotards, etc. In my estimation, the trade in insults is entirely bilateral. But, of course, it’s always easier to notice bad behavior from the other side.I have had plenty of intelligent discussions with a number of conservatives over the years: Anthony Zarrella, Richard Knight, Kevyn Nightingale, Kyle Murao, etc. The most that has ever happened from those is a feeling of oh, okay, I can now better see where you’re coming from. There has never been, nor will there ever be a feeling of wow, thank you for engaging me, I will now start voting for the other side! This isn’t to say that engagement is a waste of time; it’s not. But its only result is that you will get to see the arguments from the other side in a more complex light.Lastly, is the division we have currently especially bad? It’s not great, but I’d definitely rather be living now than, say, in 1968. The most worrisome thing we have now is that there’s no final arbiter of truth. We have different media sources, and conservatives have even started conservative universities. So, even though the evidence supporting anthropogenic global warming is solid, large numbers of conservatives in the US remain unconvinced.

Then it gets repeated to them in every avenue they already look.How do you get these people to listen to you when they “know” all you are going to say is a lie or an insult.Honestly, the message needs to be one of “look where you are now, is it better than where you were as Republicans have been in the majority of all of Congress, the White House, and as of recently, the Supreme Court.” I also think the Democrats need to show this country what liberal actually means and advocate for true social reform, Free College, Medicaid for all, Minimum income, etc.This country doesn’t need to become an also ran. This is where conservative policies have been leading us since 1980. Your money doesn’t go as far as it should and Republicans or Conservative Democrats have been steering the ship at every turn.We need a radical agenda that can be pulled back such that we actually make some progress towards a better life for all. Instead of weak policy being pulled back deep in the conservative territory where the majority of Americans end up with weaker money and deeper despair.",195,10,23,548,0,0
3,Are Democrats and Progressives going to engage Trump supporters in 2020 or just keep on insulting them?,2020 U.S. Presidential Election,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"If they are smart they will reach out to reasonable Trump supporters. By reasonable, I mean people who see the flaws in Trump but are very committed to some of his policies. Immigration reform for example. I believe there is a lot of common ground, and I believe that most Trump supporters believe that it can be done respectfully and humanely. Both the left and right accuse one another of being unempathetic, but one is just as guilty as the other. I try to remember, for example, that ranchers and farmers on the southern border routinely deal with destruction of their property. So, terrified toddlers and frustrated property owners are two sides of the same coin. You watch Fox, they are interviewing frustrated ranchers. You watch MSNBC, you see crying toddlers.What about compromise on issues like tuition free college education? Truth of the matter be known, I am a Democrat who opposes tuition free college education. But, I would be happy with a compromise that is rooted in pragmatism AND the promise of elevating bright young people out of poverty. I don’t know a single Progressive that believes money grows on trees or a single Trump supporter that would oppose measures to eradicate poverty. In short, policies would benefit from the perspectives of diverse political views. But there would have to be some give and take—for everyone.Following is a story about a Trump supporter, a retired naval officer, that goes to my church. This story reflects what can happen if we are too quick to judge based on what we believe.We had a parishioner that was openly gay and Iowa, I am proud to say, was one of the first states to approve gay marriage. This parishioner and her partner wanted the priest in our parish (Episcopal) to marry them. At that time, the Bishop of the Diocese of Iowa, had not given permission for priests to marry gay couples. So, this parishioner left the church and was married to her partner at another church, which she started attending regularly. While the priest was sympathetic, his hands were tied. When a retired naval officer learned that the gay parishioner had left the church, in the words of the priest, “he raised hell”. The reason this story is known is that the priest made the remark to the gay parishioner “that she would be surprised” at who she had in her corner. When the priest named the naval officer, she was stunned. The retired officer never mentioned it. He voted for Donald Trump because he believes in a strong national defense, tax reform and immigration reform. He is a good and decent man who went to bat for someone he valued as a friend. Does he support gay marriage? I don’t know. But I do know he supports friendships.The reason I tell that story in response to the question is that I believe that story typifies the mistakes we make when we point to an entire group of people and judge them as being good or bad. You might say we are seeing the forest but not the trees. I can say with near 100% certainty that if all that was known about the naval officer in my story is that he voted for Donald Trump, it would be assumed he was homophobic.We have all got to do a better job in talking to each other. I do not like or respect Donald Trump, but as someone who wants to see him defeated, and frankly, I don’t care how, I need to remember that people like my fellow Episcopalian naval officer have a high risk of being misunderstood simply because they are being characterized as a “Trump supporter.”For those that are entrenched in their ideology with an attitude of “my way or the highway”, they are going to find themselves in a mess of their own creation.So, whether or not they have the good sense to, yes they should try to engage with Trump supporters.",62,1,53,132,0,0

It seems as though every time I do they type “FAKE NEWS” (caps lock) and regurgitate myths about Hillary Clinton. My own mother changes the subject or hangs up the phone on me when I contradict her with verifiable facts. Trump supporters call anyone who disagrees with them online names, threaten violence, in many cases behave violently towards us. How is pointing out facts insulting? Does that make Trump supporters the real “snowflakes?”You know what IS insulting?There are infants, toddlers, and teens being removed from their parents and placed in cages at the border, then moved across the country with no trace. Trump has ordered Sessions to build “militarized tent cities” (AKA concentration camps) for these undocumented children, the youngest has been reported as being 4 months old. Why aren’t more people freaking out about this?!? There are Neo Nazis and pedophiles running (and sometimes winning) the GOP primaries. Canada is supposedly now our enemy and North Korea will soon have Trump golf resorts. Canadian Parliament has voted to condemn the American president and as retaliation, Trump ordered the DHS to “look into” building a wall on our northern border. Are we trying to keep Canadians out or keep Americans in? Since when is Canada considered a National security risk?But wait, there’s more! The House Republicans unanimously voted to remove protections for pre-existing conditions for insurance companies. The EPA is allowing asbestos to be used again in our buildings and lowering the standards for clean water and air. Black Americans are being killed by police for no reason at all while an actual child molestor is given no jail time. The NRA funneled Russian money to the GOP. We have mass shootings in schools nearly every single week, almost all nationwide mass shootings are the actions of a white, male Christian Fundamentalist. Yet this is the group screaming the loudest about being victims. Puerto Rico still doesn’t have reliable electricity or medicine. Flint still doesn’t have clean drinking water. Our National Parks are being sold for drilling to the highest bidder and have been ordered to remove all climate change language from websites. Trump gets on Twitter and threatens to jail political opponents, calls NFL players “sons of bitches,” and wants to remove press credentials from journalists who are trying to hold him accountable. Net Neutrality protections have been eliminated and the ATT/Time Warner merge has been approved, which will lead to a monopoly for cable and internet services. We now have State TV in the form of Sinclair Broadcasting and Fox News producing pro-Trump propaganda 24/7. Trump LIES daily. His press secretary LIES daily. All this while Trump’s campaign is under investigation for their participation in Russian election meddling. Trump does not care if Russia meddles. Instead, he calls our IC, DOJ, FBI CIA “liars” and never, ever criticizes Putin. Meanwhile nothing has been done to secure our elections for the future. Why not? On that note, which countries would benefit the most from Trump pulling out of EU alliances? What about stopping the military exercises? How does that benefit us? It doesn’t. It benefits Russia and China. Also, there is no NK “deal.” It was a photo op. Nothing was gained for our benefit, but plenty was given to a murderous dictator. This is exactly why North Korean experts cautioned against Trump relying only on his “gut feelings.” We don’t even have witnesses as to what was agreed upon in the meeting because Trump demanded that they meet without ambassadors or NatSec officials. And no, Dennis Rodman doesn’t count.There are some who call themselves “Constitutionalists” who typically vote Republican but who are apparently now selective in which part of the Constitution they want upheld. They are fine with Trump and his nepotistic family in violation of the Emoluments Clause. They are fine with the rampant corruption at all levels of the administration. As long as the 2nd Amendment stays in place without any restrictions all the other Amendments can be scrapped.This is MAGA? How? And why should I (or any patriot) allow this to happen without calling it out? No, I WILL NOT engage his supporters. Fuck ‘em. I’m tired of doing the heavy lifting of providing facts to challenge their beliefs. I read, I question, I double check sources. Why can’t they? If the GOP is enabling Trump’s corruption, there is nothing left to do but resist…and VOTE. This is who the Republicans have chosen. This is the path they have chosen to take. At this point in the game, if Trump supporters and Republicans can’t see the damage they are doing, it means they are actively participating in the destruction. There is no longer a middle ground. The red MAGA hat is now synonymous with White Supremacy, Nazis, pedophiles, and the fall of a democratic republic. I have zero tolerance for that sort of behavior. I am not being hyperbolic. Everything I have mentioned above is actually happening right here. Right now.

8,"California is almost completely controlled by the Democratic party - why do they continue to tolerate such enormous inequality and poverty (when adjusted for cost of living, taxes/transfers, etc)?",Politics of California,Social Inequality,Economic Inequality,1!,1!,1!,"I lived and worked in California from 1990 to 2015 - from the San Diego area a mile from the Mexico border in the south to the foothills of Sierra Nevada mountains in the north.I'm going to generalize - to the precipice of disingenuousness - to make a point.California needs vast numbers of low skilled, low paid workers to take care of the lawns, clean office buildings, and harvest the produce. Sharing a border with Mexico, it is easy to attract millions who would rather toil in 110 degree California lettuce and strawberry fields than get beheaded by drug cartels - the latter which flourish because of the black market created by the unending and useless U.S. 'War on Drugs'.Because of the weather and other amenities, many of the top skilled and talented people of the U.S. and the world wish to live there. (Think: Elon Musk or Harvey Weinstein). They are the most productive and inventive and therefore can produce enormous income and wealth. In strokes of entrepreneurial genius, Musk is selling one-way tickets to Mars and Weinstein almost single- handed supported the sofa (aka couch) manufacturing industry.The political class, as is the case mostly everywhere, are parasites. Other than their proficiency in scheming to expropriate the enormous wealth of California business and citizens, they are ignoramuses (think: Gov. Jerry Brown or former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger).At such scheming they're geniuses - so they know they can enact completely idiotic and counterproductive political and taxation schemes that benefit them, their cronies and their ilk that thinks like them (think: taxpayer subsidized professors and snowflakes at UC-Berkeley and public sector employee unions) that in most other places would be rejected by the populace - because the likes of Musk and Weinstein are there - and they've got hundreds of miles of ocean beaches - and cars last longer because they don't rust and corrode - and you can drive a convertible with the top down almost all year.Most other places - economically - would have already been destroyed by these policies - but not California - because it is awash in wealth almost unprecedented in history and Baywatch was filmed there (think: Pamela Anderson in a swimsuit - or even better without one)Instead, the wealth is being ever more concentrated, the middle class eviscerated, and the lower economic class expanded. Adding to their woes, the #metoo movement has caused a slump in the sofa industry due to the decline in casting couch sales.This simply results in ever more power vested in the political class - which is entirely their objective. And since the wealth is ever more concentrated - it is easier to steal.But the lawns and landscaping are immaculate and - provided it snows in the Sierra Nevada mountains - California will continue to be the home of the largest agriculture output in the U.S.No one seems to question the idea that it makes perfect sense to grow almonds in the arid Central valley when each single almond requires a full gallon of water to grow and harvest. As in many things, what normal Americans think is common sense is not what Californians think.Of course in a twisted paradox, vast quantities of 'illegal' drugs, for which the drug war is intended to prevent, end up in the nostrils, veins and lungs of the Californians who then need the affordable low paid lawn and landscape services provided to them indirectly thanks to the violence of the cartels spawned by the drug war perpetrated by the political class to curb their citizens' drug use.Go figure.If only they would start filming a new Baywatch series in Santa Monica, I might move back. I'm pretty sure I can get start a lucrative lawn and landscaping service and find plenty of customers and workers.Research Addendum (for those thinking I'm just a bloviating arrogant asshole)-""It's no wonder then, that the government of California has been able to abuse its taxpayers so freely. California has one of the highest tax burdens in the nation, and many leave the state because of it. More and more, the state is become a playground for the wealthy who have enough of a surplus to endure what ordinary people cannot. Thanks to endless regulations on development via environmental regulations and other measures, housing supply has been artificially limited, and thus the cost of housing in California has skyrocketed. This has led to a situation in which, as the Sacramento Bee put it ""California exports its poor to Texas... while wealthier people move in."" But California apparently isn't exporting all its poor — the state has the worst poverty rate in the nation when the cost of living is taken into account.""https://mises.org/wire/splitting...",19.2k,407,404,308,0,1
8,"California is almost completely controlled by the Democratic party - why do they continue to tolerate such enormous inequality and poverty (when adjusted for cost of living, taxes/transfers, etc)?",Politics of California,Social Inequality,Economic Inequality,1!,1!,1!,"You seem to think “Democrat” means “liberal” or “progressive”. It does not. Especially not in California, where our Democrats tend to have more in common with moderate Republicans than they do progressives. California was a Republican stronghold for so long that Democratic presidential candidates often didn’t even bother showing up. So what changed? The Republican party changed.In California we tend to care more about what you can do to make money and what you have to contribute to our economy and to your community than we have ever much cared about what two consenting adults do with their genitals in the privacy of their own home. When the GOP adopted the “Southern Strategy” they actually politicized people’s private lives. They advocated for a government so small it could fit in your female neighbor’s uterus, but NOT in corporate boardroom. They adopted a strong anti-immigrant stance - a mistake if you want to keep a wealthy state with a large immigrant population on your side, especially when immigrants tend to be conservative. That’s simply the tip of the iceberg.California didn’t change from Republican stronghold to liberal nightmare. We’ve always had areas that were much more liberal than other areas. San Francisco and the surrounding area is much more liberal than Los Angeles and definitely more liberal than San Diego. We are both capitalists and consumerists who are strongly money motivated and, rightly or wrongly, as a group we place our own financial interests above the needs of others - as is common pretty much everywhere.To be fair, the California Democratic party also changed. They seem to still believe we should leave people and their genitals alone - what you do with your junk is your own business, not the government’s - unless your behaviors clearly have a negative impact on the rest of your community. So being in same gender love is a-okay, but pumping toxins into the environment for us to breathe, drink or grow our food in is NOT so OK. One of those things only concerns the people directly involved, the other concerns all of us because it can harm all of us. This is exactly as it should be. However, in their fiscal policies, the local Democrats have moved much closer to the traditional Republican party that ruled California for so long. We even have a constitutional amendment that dictates most tax increases must be voter approved, so we the people of California get to choose how much we are willing to spend to solve the problems in California. This is important, as I have been told that is not the action of a ‘liberal’ or ‘progressive’ state, who apparently impose shockingly high tax rates on their citizenry regardless of what the people being taxed think about it. Not so in California, where taxes are voter-approved by law.The California Democrats will not change their ways and start addressing the very real poverty and inequality issues we have long struggled with in this state until we force them to change. We need to address these issues in meaningful ways and sustain any programs and actions that work, regardless of the current state of the economy, rather than cutting services the instant there’s a dip in our pocketbooks - when people need those services the most. While we have started to openly recognize that there is something terribly wrong with things like old people and the terminally ill dying in the shrubbery for lack of truly affordable housing, very few people are willing to give up any of their money to help them as they don’t seem to recognize or care that they are ultimately helping themselves as well.I am hopeful, though. Twenty years ago people dying in the shrubbery for lack of housing and medical care was not even viewed as a problem unless you were the one who stumbled over the body. After all, aren’t all homeless people mentally ill drug addicts? That perception is rapidly changing and hopefully our group response to the rampant inequality and poverty here will change along with it to something meaningful and lasting.The love of money over people is just part of the reason we have such massive income inequality despite being what is essentially a Democratically controlled state. I hope to see this issue (and many others) start to be resolved in my lifetime. This is my home. I love it like no other place and have cried real, heartbroken tears both times I’ve left. I have always returned home within a year.

Which is why the otherwise thriving state comes up high on the poverty chart. The economy is good but too many people can’t afford rents or to buy a home.The solution is to build more housing. But unfortunately, housing is controlled locally in many cases, and the residents of many local counties are opposed to building more housing.So the problem really isn’t poverty, it’s housing.

The fact that he had to run as a democrat and then getting shut-out by the corrupt democratic machinery shows that the system is still quite strong. What I think he has done is to move the needle slightly to the left. Most democrats in this country are really centrists and not very far left on the liberal scale. Sanders raised issues that resonated with many people who are fed up with the current system of government, values and raised the possibility of a paradigm shift. However, in the end, most people who actively and enthusiastically supported Sanders have been largely silent in a grand scale. His splinter organization has focused more on getting people elected within the Democratic party that are slightly more progressive than the “old guard” and while his run in 2020 may be possible, I don’t think he has the juice to get it done this time around. I too gave him multiple contributions of $27 and actually registered as a dem in order to vote for him, but I don’t think his organization is very accessible to everyone. I even tried to contact them to volunteer and I do have some campaign and political pedigree, but didn’t even get a response saying they didn’t need me. All this tells me is that they are organizationally not very efficient and don’t take it personally, but in order to engage the majority of these centrist democrats and so called liberals, it will take an all hands on deck approach. His message, while hopeful, has not ignited any sparks in the democratic party which sits idly on its hands and squandering the opportunity to set a national vision and re-invent the party into a relevant organization. They had the opportunity to rid corruption in the DNC and DCCC with some level of transparency but have failed to do so. This is going to hurt them both in the long and short run.

It does not mean that there are no consequences for your speech, of course, just that it can’t come from the government.Ok, seems reasonable on the surface but it’s not nearly so cut and dried.The NFL has a process by which a rule change like this needs to happen and it is clear that process wasn’t followed. The Commissioner never did call for an actual vote of the owners; he assumed it would be unanimous. These changes also have to go through the players union and other approvals before they can be adopted. None of that has happened either.So based on that alone, the new rule is invalid until it does go through the process.There are also antitrust issues since there is no other football league in the US where the players could reasonably go to if they wanted to leave the NFL. It’s not like you work for a Walmart, decide you don’t like their policies and then go get a comparable job at Target. Yes, they are paid to play a game but that is also their career.Also worth mentioning that the NFL recognizes and accommodates for other first amendment rights, like wearing religious symbols so long as player safety isn’t an issue and they are covered. Troy Polomalu has a cross on his nameplate on his jersey but his hair covers it.My biggest concern with this is the role Trump has taken on this fight. As I said before, the government can’t punish you for your speech. But what happens when the government pressures your employer to punish you for speech it doesn’t like?At the very least, Trump habit of calling on private employers to do just that is problematic. But couple that with statements from certain NFL owners that said Trump has directly communicated and colluded with NFL league VIPs in the creation of this rule.

This force focuses its attention in two areas: 1) Reducing legal constraints on the wealthy, and 2) Modifying the political system so that those constraints do not get re-imposed.The other is the force pushing for what, in want of a better word, we may call democracy: protecting the interests of the working class and middle class, protecting the environment, preserving the educational system, improving the health-care system, keeping roads and bridges functional, and so on.The oligarchy doesn’t care about any of that.

1,"Can the UK, or any nation, operate democratically without the executive (House of Lords/Senate)?",U.K. House of Lords,U.S. Senate,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,"Technically, yes. A unicameral (single chamber) legislature would still operate democratically if that chamber were democratically elected. (Note that the second chamber is *not* the executive; the executive in the US is the President and in the UK it is Her Majesty’s Cabinet).However, the likely result of that process would be a lot of shoddy legislation passed into law. The Lords, while not democratic, are increasingly meritocratic, with members chosen from experts in various fields of law, business, and technology rather than just politicians ‘kicked upstairs’. They have no power to make laws, but can stall the democratic process by sending legislation back to Parliament for review.The benefit of this process is that it allows poor quality legislation to be reviewed and shot down. Poor quality legislation is usually a bill which is created in Parliament for noble-sounding emotional aims (minority rights, women’s rights, equality, fair taxes, and other good things) without proper scrutiny of the writing on paper. If passed into law, in other words, these bills would have very different effects to the intention on the headline. Politicians who don’t understand the constitutional logic of the political system - and I’ve met a few - create these bad bills because they want to get headlines as the person making positive change.

Ironically, Bernie Sanders seems to be standing where the Democrats used to be, slightly to the left of center, but in the current perspectives, is accused of being an extreme leftist. Trump’s influence has far exceeded Nixon’s efforts and has encouraged the most virulent bigotry to climb out from under its rocks, which conflicts with JBS official statements condemning bigotry, though several of its members went on to found white supremacist organizations.

He has recently claimed that we now have the “greatest economy in history”. And yet:Total employment: Trump ranks 3rd highest among seven presidents on overall job creation, going back to Nixon. Job creation was stronger under Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton at the same point in their presidencies.Manufacturing employment: Trump ranks second in the number of manufacturing jobs created since he became president, trailing only Carter. This is his highest mark.Growth in average hourly earnings: Trump ranks third, behind Carter and George W. Bush.Exports: This data only goes back to 1992, but since then, Trump ranks third out of four presidents, behind Clinton and Barack Obama. This is his lowest mark.The S&P 500 stock index. Trump is third again. Stocks did better under Obama and George H.W. Bush during their first 16 months.Real GDP per capita. Third again, behind Carter and Clinton once more.If the economy continues to improve under Trump, his Trumponomics grade will go higher. He’ll also benefit by comparison to some of the other presidents. Jimmy Carter, for instance, came into office as a recovery from recession was gaining steam. But the recovery petered out by his fourth year in office, when a fresh recession began.It’s not obvious, however, that the Trump economy will continue to improve. Goldman Sachs, for instance, forecasts GDP growth of 2.9% in 2018, in part because the tax cuts Trump signed in December will stimulate spending—for a while. But Goldman’s growth forecasts for the next three years fall to 2.2%, 1.5%, and 1.3%. If that’s how it plays out, growth for Trump’s first term would average just 2.2%—barely better than the 2% growth of the prior four years under Obama.The last time the unemployment rate was at 3.8%, as it is now, was in 2000. But back then, a combination of strong growth, low unemployment and solid earnings produced a federal budget surplus for four years in a row, from 1998 through 2001. The annual surplus peaked in 2000 at $236 billion.There are no surpluses now, which suggests the Trump economy might have a hollow core. The federal deficit this year will hit around $800 billion, up from $665 billion last year and $585 billion in Obama’s final year. And the Congressional Budget Office expects deficits to rise to more than $1 trillion per year by 2020, and go nowhere but up.That’s one big reason some economists think strong numbers on jobs and growth won’t last.“These solid numbers look increasingly illusory,” Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist of the Economic Outlook Group, wrote in a recent note to clients. “A healthy economy does not generate historic deficits.” He places the odds of a recession in 2019 at 55%.

To be fair, if the economy really tanked, he would have been blamed, but the economy was handed over to his administration in the best shape it had been in a long time unlike when Obama took office.One thing to note however, most economists warn that Trump’s isolationist policies will likely cut GDP drastically. The figures tossed around is in the neighborhood of $2 trillion. His foreign and trade policies are like watching amateur hour episodes of Pros vs Joes. At the rate he is going, even his most loyal supporters will have to withdraw any public support to save their own necks.

Unfortunately, the dominant factions in the republican caucus have higher priorities.The republican House caucus is paralyzed because it is divided between corporate conservatives, populist conservatives, and ultra-conservative True Believers. All of the factions are anti-government and anti-tax. All of them pander to the republican base.The corporate conservatives are not as strong as the others on conservative social issues. They tend to want the economy and the government to continue functioning to serve the interests of business, which they consider to be the purpose of elected officials.The populist conservatives are convinced that liberals are destroying America and believe all federal government programs are part of that effort. They still support programs like Social Security and Medicare for their own constituents, whom they consider virtuous, hard working Americans, but wish to cut those programs overall, as they believe that most of the money involved goes to minorities and illegal immigrants who are parasites on the system and addicted to government handouts.The True Believers consider all non conservatives to be a threat to America and wish to use the powers of the federal government to dissemble it and punish all liberals, who they believe to be outright criminals.It does not help at all that most of these congressmen are very limited in their breadth of education and intellect. Within their political belief system, populist conservatives are simply suspicious of intellectuals. The few they respect work at conservative think tanks and universities. Among corporatists, legislator is considered a secondary profession. The people who make this a career choice are not the “best and brightest.” If they were, they would have become business executives or corporate lawyers. They are like accountants, advertisers, and media consultants. They are in their positions to serve the the respected elite who know how to generate wealth.The democrats have factions, also, but they are not relevant, as the populist conservatives and true believers in the republican caucus usually will not work with them at all. Which makes sense, as these republicans either believe or pretend to believe that all democrats are fakes and criminals. Republicans who do try to work with democrats are subject to powerful attacks by right wing media and organizers.The situation is only slightly less difficult in the senate, where most of the members are more experienced politicians at the national level and most still have some sense of the purpose and mechanics of government. They are the “voices of reason” whenever the True Believers want to shut the government down, as they believe that American voters are still capable of punishing the republicans for failures at the federal level.The current crisis has President Trump at its center, but it should never be forgotten that he is president only because the most powerful national republicans refused to stand against him during the primaries. They knew perfectly well that he was erratic, ignorant, and dangerous, but were unwilling to risk alienating base voters. They were, and still are, the only people who could stop Trump from destroying American credibility, alienating friendly governments, or starting a war with Iran or Korea. The only priorities that move them to action are cutting corporate taxes and approving ultra-conservative judges.

The key word in it is “progress’, a relative term that totally changes based on the perspective of the viewer. Progress for one is not progress for the other. Hitler thought the German people were “progressing”, some people might disagree. The use of the word to describe America’s left was nothing but a brilliant move by political strategists. Socialist, was an evil word, leftist had bad connotations so they came up with a word based on “progress” as though it was universally believed that moving leftward was indeed “progress’.In spite of the brilliant polemics, the leftist candidates have had a tough time up to now. The reason is more due to their inexperience than it is about the political stripe of the country. Clearly America is ready to move leftward! In the last seven presidential elections only once did the republican candidate capture the popular vote, that was in 2004 when everyone was fearful of 9/11 like attacks.So the ideological stage is set! However the leftward medium is a joke. The left leaning democrats that have come to the helm are a jokers group of bozos, full of hatred, vitriol and anger.

The leftward lurch in America has to be a gentle one as decades of loathing of anything that remotely resembles communism has brainwashed the audience.Instead of realizing this political reality and introducing sharp, young candidates that will sweet talk the virtues of a leftist society they bring forth firebrand nutcases.

Had the establishment Democratic candidate been anyone other than Clinton, Sanders would probably have been out by Super Tuesday.Even though I’m diametrically opposed to most of his positions, had the election come down to Sanders/Trump, I’d probably have gone with Sanders, because he seemed like a decent and honorable person, and with a Republican House and Senate, none of his crazy ideas would have been enacted.But that doesn’t extend to Congressional candidates, and moderates like me are never going to support a progressive candidate any more than we would be likely to support a far right candidate. And people like me are largely the ones who decide general elections, because you’ve got essentially three camps of people — those who reliably vote Democrat, those who reliably vote Republican and those who vacillate between the two or pick and choose. The first group is fairly liberal, the second group fairly conservative so the third group is, by default, mostly moderates.Now, in some places (mostly large cities on the coasts,) the first group is so overwhelming that the second and third group don’t matter, and in those places, you’ll find the odd progressive on the ballot, because in those districts, it’s not a matter of liberal versus conservative, but rather a fight based on how liberal one is.But those places are few and far between, which is why progressivism will never be a mainstream political ideology in the United States.

There was a time when family values and protecting the Constitution meant something. There was a time when personal integrity came before personal agendas.There was a day when Republicans had the balls to force their own president out of office because of his crimes.But those days ended with Nixon’s resignation.That party was replaced by the one that thought it was okay to make a deal with Iran not to release the American hostages until after the election, and who sold them arms in order to secretly fund the Contras to fight the socialist Sandinista government in Nicaragua.My mom was a teacher at an inner city school and my dad was a social worker dealing with people in East L.A., so I had a vague idea about how tough it is for the poor. For that reason, I tended to side with the Democratic party.My opposition to the Viet Nam war also had something to do with which party I supported in 1968 and 1972, although I was too young to vote.When I finally got the right to vote, I was too involved with my career to think much about politics.I didn’t vote for Reagan mostly because he sounded like the cowboy riding the A-bomb through a B-52 bomb chute at the end of Doctor Strangelove instead of a serious presidential candidate.One day, though, I remember hearing a statement from the Reagan administration claiming that ketchup was a vegetable, in order to justify cutting funds for school lunches.And it just blew my mind.In looking up the actual statement today, it turns out my memory of the statement was twisted by the media’s reporting. According to wikipedia, the USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service allowed local school lunch administrators to credit a condiment such as pickle relish as a vegetable, this is the same thing as saying ketchup counts as a vegetable in some poor kid’s lunch.For anyone who has ever read the ingredients on a ketchup or relish bottle, this is insane, the kind of spin doctoring right out of Orwell’s “1984.”The callous attitude toward poor children, and the legalistic lying used to cover up their nasty budget cuts pushed me even further away from ever considering a Republican candidate.Fast forward to 2000, and I thought that John McCain was the one Republican with enough integrity to earn my vote. Unfortunately, he was destroyed by dirty tricks during the Republican primary by Karl Rove and the Bush campaign. They used a fake automatic telephone poll asking people ""Would you be more or less likely to vote for John McCain…if you knew he had fathered an illegitimate black child?"" (The truth was he had adopted a little girl from Bangladesh.)Dirty Tricks, South Carolina and John McCainThat was the one and probably last time I ever considered a Republican candidate for any office, especially after watching Bush destroy the country in so many ways with the non-response to warnings about 9/11, illegal wars, tax cuts for the rich while cutting social programs, outing a CIA agent to try to discredit a diplomat from exposing the lies used by Bush to start a war, etc.There’s one more problem I have with Republican party and whatever it has become, and that is the lack of individual integrity. As long as a politician votes along party lines, they are good to go.That includes:Guys who hire prostitutes while wearing diapers (really Louisiana, you couldn’t have gotten rid of David Vitter?)Candidates for Senate who have to claim they are not witches (Are you kidding Delaware? You chose a woman who “dabbled in witchcraft?”)Men whose education and ideology matches the witch by talking about how “legitimate” rapes rarely leads to victims getting pregnant (Are you out of your minds, Missouri?)Allow an accused child molester run for Senate (Sweet Home Alabama?)For the Democrats, at least they have the decency to remove politicians who don’t abide by the rules:Sending dick pix to strange women? Bye bye, Weiner.Soliciting bribes in the Windy City? Impeach governor Blagojevich and send him to prison.Take a picture seven years ago with your hands floating over the breasts of a sleeping USO entertaining, regardless of the fact said breasts are protected by over 3/4″ of kevlar body armor and the “victim” never woke up? Go back to comedy, Franken.Isn’t it amazing that these same Republicans who condemned Agent Orange for his racist statements, his attacks on the military service of John McCain, his pussy grabbing remarks, and swore “never” have bent over backwards to give him whatever he wants, or quietly drop out of politics without standing up and fighting for the good of this country?Those are the things that now make it impossible for me to ever vote for a Republican.",11.2k,677,858,135,0,2

You can talk about being true to ideals all you want. But in the end, if you cast a vote for a third party candidate, you are only fracturing the vote for the candidate who (at least sort of) represents your beliefs AND stands a chance of winning. Casting a vote for the third party candidate is essentially throwing out something good in a vain attempt at finding perfection.I was born too late. Once upon a time there was a Republican candidate for president that I totally would have voted for. His party platform encouraged unions, higher corporate taxes, and desegregation of schools. He almost singlehandedly established the interstate highway system as we know it today. As a bonus, he was an undisputed war hero with a keen grasp on the idea that war was not the solution for everything; indeed, that it was often essentially theft from those who were poor. When he left office, he warned of the military-industrial complex which was poised to encourage military conflict for the sake of profit. His name was General Dwight David Eisenhower, and he left office in 1961, five years before I was born. Richard Nixon offered a somewhat corrupted form of his ideology, but it died in 1974 along with Nixon's presidency. After that, Republicanism is pretty much a wasteland of attempts at evangelical theocracy, military (mis)adventures, jingoism, decimation of social safety nets, hypocrisy, personal and social bigotry, and enrichment of the already fabulously wealthy. Had I been born 35 years earlier, I could have happily voted for a Republican, no problem.Democrats, ironically, do pro-life better than the Republicans who preach it. I disagree quite vehemently with the idea espoused by most Democrats that abortion ought to be a choice for anyone, because it does not square with basic morality as it pertains to killing people, and because the science clearly backs up the understanding that even the smallest zygote is genetically unique and differentiated from either of her parents, strongly indicating the presence of an individual human and not merely a random “cluster of cells”. But Democrats, through their policies, make abortions less appealing to those most likely to face that awful choice by reducing the conditions which tend to lead to that choice; conditions such as poverty and social ostracism. While Republicans, in theory, are pro-life, they have a tendency to create those conditions where women feel too vulnerable emotionally and financially to consider keeping their child.To sum up, in order for me to vote for someone other than a Democrat, either a change has to occur in our voting system to make third parties a viable option; the Republicans have to field an honorable candidate with the same record or at least the same policies as Eisenhower; and/or the Republicans have to recognize that calling yourself pro-life means you have to actually do things that encourage a pro-life environment for others.",2.3k,173,724,"1,192",0,0

I voted straight Republican through the 80s.Then after the Cold War, I started giving Democrats a look. I found I agreed with Democrats on many policies. I valued education, the environment, and without the Cold War, I was okay with cutting the military. I never could quite get on the anti-abortion train either. I thought government shouldn’t interfere with such a personal decision, and never could bring myself to equate a microscopic zygote with a human being.I started voting for some Democrats, and with Bill Clinton, they seemed more centrist—but even then, my own values were evolving toward a more leftwards direction. I thought everyone should have access to equal health care.Then I went to college and became more educated, and the more I learned, the more the Democratic Party’s values seemed to mesh with what I learned in the world and what I truly cared about.Meanwhile, the Republican party was becoming more and more radical, and was marching hard toward a more and more rightward direction, even as the Democrats were becoming more centrist.It’s at the point now where those who typically vote Republican strike me as—at least all too often—bigoted or at least willing to tolerate or turn a blind eye to bigotry. They also seem to inhabit an entirely different Orwellian universe, where up is down, in is actually out, and so on. Furthermore, they seem hellbent on entrenching themselves in power through gerrymandering, voter suppression, and any other tool at their disposal—democracy be damned.It’s at the point where I no longer trust Republicans at all. Even reasonable, competent Republicans that 20 years ago might have attracted my vote—at least in local races—I don’t trust them, because the party they belong to. I don’t want to empower or do anything at all to strengthen that party one bit—not at least until they reform.As far as any other party, such as the Greens? Voting for other left candidates or parties doesn’t work for me. Whenever they run, whether it’s McCarthy in 1968, Anderson in 1980, Nader in 2000, or Stein in 2016, what ends up happening is it’s just a recipe for conservative victory. It frequently draws away enough votes for the extreme right Republican candidate to win.Without Nader, Gore would have won in 2000, Bush would have lost, and the Iraq war would never have happened, and probably the economy would not have crashed either. Now we have Trump, thanks in part to Jill Stein, whose voters would have given Hillary the margin of victory in several key states where the vote was extremely close.And I think it’s a total crock of shit—this notion that the Democrats in these races were “just as bad” as the Republican. That’s utter bullshit. Any objective reading of the principles and policies the Democratic candidates advocated were far more in alignment with the values of most liberals. Giving a speech at Goldman Sachs does not make a candidate “just as bad”. Someone who agrees with you 95% of the time is not your enemy.So if I expect to have any hope of seeing government policies that clean up the environment, maintain a woman’s right to choose whether she will carry a pregnancy to term—I must vote Democrat, and consistently. If I ever want to see Medicare for all or another National Health care policy that will protect me—I have to vote Democrat—always. If I want a country that is not Russia’s puppet, if I want a country with equal rights for all—regardless of one’s religion or skin color or sexual orientation, if I want a country who protects the poor over the wealthy, who supports workers over employers, who regulates Wall Street rather than lets them gamble away our retirement and our mortgages—I must vote Democrat consistently—even when they have problems, even when I don’t agree 100% with a given candidate, even when I get pissed at them for making a speech to Goldman Sachs.Any person with liberal values—who respects education, wants to protect the environment, equal rights for women, access to birth control and family planning, who wants to regulate industry, who values voting rights for all people, who wants the right to enjoy quality health care—if you are not voting Democrat, you are empowering Republicans and shooting yourselves in the foot, and you will not live to see these ideals realized.",10.3k,594,484,"1,171",0,0

I used to do that myself. But since the 2000 campaign, the story has changed. The Republican Party has moved so far right in its pragmatical lust for power that its more reasonable members can no longer run.Really, the change happened under Gingrich, who scorned civility, and who labored specifically to transform liberalism into a foul word with the public, to cast liberals as weak, contemptible, lazy, hedonistic, selfish, profligate, undisciplined, and “elite,” or whatever other epithet came to mind. Negative positioning, I believe is the expression. Entirely pragmatic, cunning, divorced from morality or responsible statesmanship or truth. It has been an effective political tool, in the short run.Republicans aren’t alone in these tactics. Democrats have practiced them, too, and continue to practice them, but when the question is “why are most liberals unable to vote for,” etc., etc., the answer is clear: why vote for a party that heaps scorn on you and everything you believe in? — that twists, say, respect for individual human rights and dignity, concern for the poor (a New Testament charge), concern for the environment, and a preference for peace (another Christian doctrine, interestingly) into something so foul that it makes a “good” Republican vomit? If you’re going to speak my name and spit, you get no love from me.That cynical Gingrich “revolution” (the result, probably, of corruption in Congress, which the Democrats had held forever) did a lot of damage to the Democratic Party, not only with the voting public, but to the party itself. Clinton’s “New Democrat” rightward lurch (toward big business, away from programs to help the poor, toward militaristic foreign involvement) can be traced to Gingrich-era Dem-shaming — and to a desire among Democrats to win the White House (they thought they needed big corporation money to do that).No, you won’t find me voting for Republicans any more, no more than I’d respect a guy who lied to me and punched me in the face.Both Republicans and Democrats could use a dose of humility.

Most people think that means a 3rd-party vote is wasted and, so, choose to vote only for a Dem or Rep. (In fact, they will be rude, insulting, and condescending towards anyone who expresses a 3rd-party preference).Most people are then left to choose between the two parties. Some vote for the party that represents their views more closely. Others vote against the party that is more antithetical to their views.

2,Are prison sentences too long in the United States?,Incarceration,Prisoners,Prisons and Prison Life,1!,1!,1!,"One night I heard a statistic, courtesy of Trevor Noah, that the USA has 5% of the world's population. Yet we have 25% of the world's prison population. Of course, the source I heard it from said it was to our shame that it should be so.So I got to thinking why it may possibly be that way. Of course, the social scientists and true believers in the ""innate goodness of man"" want you to buy the fact that the ""system"" is racist, picks on the poor and uneducated who merely commit crimes because they are addicts and/or poor, trying to feed their habits or families.Is there not another reason? That our nation is the one who has dedicated professionals, from police, to prosecutors & defense counsel, and has juries of everyday people who will take the needed time to consider innocence, or guilt, and hand down a punishment to the offender, while allowing the not-guilty to walk? Think of the labs set up to determine the fingerprints and DNA of the unknown suspects. The forensic artists who can recreate a person’s face from applying clay to the skull, or can add years to a child based on their early photos. Forensic dentists who can match bite marks. All those collected bound volumes of vehicles, tire tracks, edged weapons, tools & tool marks, natural, man-made & animal fibers, and paint samples. The labs which can tell you which brand & type of gun fired a bullet and then match that bullet to the gun when it's recovered. The technology to find and restore serial numbers filed off of bicycles, guns, and other stamped, serialized objects. The labs which can identify a poison. My lord, there’s even a facility where they bury or otherwise place donated dead bodies in various conditions to decompose so that they may gather the scientific knowledge to determine how and when another crime victim’s body was left by killers. Keep in mind that often times, that all this science stuff actually eliminates or exonerates suspects, even freeing people from previous bad convictions.Let's say your loved one is the victim of a horrific crime in Botswana, Burma, Bulgaria, or a remote village in Bolivia. Do you think the local cops and prosecution will be sending out samples of evidence to tie the suspect to the crime, or ID them in the first place? Even (so-called) techno-savvy and industrialized Japan, has a lack of crime labs and medical examiners, the further you get away from the large cities - I read an article where a young man was found dead in a remote area, with cigarette burns on his body and multiple slash and stab wounds to his torso. The local “medical examiner’s” conclusion? Heart failure! Somewhere in Japan, a killer is (or, killers are) walking free, to kill again...and likely get away with it – if forensic services do not improve.European justice? Remember the idiot in Norway, who killed 84 people (mostly teens and children)? He got 26 years in prison, roughly 123 days for each life he snuffed out. Kill one, or kill 200, if caught for murder in Norway you get just 26 years. You want that? South African justice? Shoot and kill your girlfriend while she’s in the bathroom. You’re sentenced to eight years. You’re out in less than two. Then the courts change their mind and you’re re-convicted of murder and you’re headed back to prison.Please know that “justice” in many other developing and third-world nations is what you get by your own hand. You track down and beat (or perhaps kill) the person who wronged you or your family. Only if you can, with no help from the authorities, though. Likely, his surviving family will do the same in regards to you…and on and on it will go – The Italians have a word for it, vendetta.I will admit that our criminal justice system is not perfect and yes, the racist label has been justified, sometimes. But because a few case are slanted, racist and rigged - it does not render the entire system as such. No more than merely signing a pro sports contract will make one a superstar athlete - some will achieve that level, most others will not. You have to admit that here, more than one rich, prominent, and/or elected official has been imprisoned for their acts – there are some people who learn the hard way they are not above the law.I can appreciate the fact that most people on Death Row and or serving really long sentences have worked damn hard to get there. While some may see the system as harsh, I see it as too soft, too rigged in the favor of the offender. Those of us in police work call it a ""Hug-a-Thug"" mentality.In my 40 years of police work, and likely thousands of misdemeanor and felony arrests, I would be surprised if 10% went to prison for a long time. Yes, I have a murderer on CA's Death Row. He will die of natural causes. The kidnapper/rapists I nailed? They're out by now - they got 25 years and I'll bet they didn't do all 25. The guy I arrested off-duty for shooting & killing his ex-girlfriend’s new boyfriend two doors down from me? Out in 3.5 years of his 7 year sentence. Most of the people I arrested for drugs? They got probation and treatment. Maybe on their third or fourth screw up, they got more; but really, first time drug offenders (with no other priors and or extenuating circumstances) don't do hard time - don't buy it, automatically, when some bleeding heart, (so-called) social justice warrior tells you it's a fact.06/07/2018 EDITED TO ADD: This response, however interpreted, was intended to respond to Trevor Noah's Daily Show comment.

Those NFL protests began while Barack Obama was president. Rather, the issue is that a few athletes were vocally critical of the current president, Donald Trump, and enjoyed extremely widespread coverage by the media.Consequently, a handful of players turned something that is traditionally considered an honor — a sitting president congratulating the players to the White House — into something of a debacle.I’m a fan of several teams with outspoken athletes and coaches whose political views that I strongly disagree with. Should I stop supporting that team because of a handful of athletes who try to use their fame to influence others politically?Sadly, I noticed that I didn’t care as much about football last year. This is strange because I have been a big fan of the NFL and college football since I was a child. Not only did the protests affect my perception of the NFL, but I found MEDIA BIAS of the issue incredibly frustrating and condescending.Last year, I began to turn off ESPN after it had been my go-to source for sports. I watched the Super Bowl and playoffs. However, I went out on Sunday afternoons and evenings and only occasionally checked the scores on my phone.Now, the same thing is starting to happen with the NBA. My two favorite teams were in the playoffs. One of my favorite teams is in the finals.Unfortunately, the coaches and some players from those teams are under the misguided impression that I value their sociopolitical views or that there isn’t any consequence when they mock, ridicule or vilify individuals in office with whom they disagree (via opinions that are often based more upon myth than fact).If this continues, it will be a turnoff. I don’t watch the NBA to know what a small group of athletic entertainers think about the president, law enforcement or any number of sociopolitical issues. I do care when they are condescending even with a stated position that is blatantly ignorant with fact.Will voters in Wisconsin or Pennsylvania care?Obviously, this will depend upon each individual. I support any person’s right to a clear conscience. I also support the right of protest. Moreover, I am probably one of the biggest fans of professional sports that you’ll ever encounter.However, I do NOT support a perceived “right” of a professional athlete to show up to work in his/her employer’s uniform and use that time to protest against perceptions of law enforcement or anything else. If you want to protest, then do it on your OWN time.Moreover, I support every person’s right to an opinion about politics and politicians. However, I can be easily turned off by athletes who use their time in front of cameras or reporters to constantly attack a politician or his/her supporters.Sports should be about, well, sports. I’m not a fan of the Eagles because of the sociopolitical views of a handful of the players. I am not a fan of the Golden State Warriors or Spurs because of the coaches’ views on Trump. This isn’t a lofty concept — but it can be an economic one if these players and coaches aren’t careful.",86,0,38,174,0,0

2,"Let’s say if I owned a business and I fired every radical conservatives and radical liberals, could I do it, and would Americans thank me?",Political Radicals,Political Radicalism,1!,1!,1!,1!,"For the long answer.To understand how you could even ask this question, you must first look at the past history, compare it to the present day, to even begin to plan for the future of your theoretical business.From my lifelong experience in working as a union and non-union member in both right-to-work states and closed shop states I learned how horrible unions can be. During my first real jobs as a labor, truck driver, and an equipment oiler on a heavy construction project I learned the hard way. Since I was a temporary employee working summers to earn enough money to go to college during the winter I did not feel compelled to join any of their unions. On that project, no matter what your title was you either worked hard or you got a pink slip (fired.) I didn’t have a problem with that as I’ve always been thankful for having a job. I was threatened by the union and was even almost killed by them as a crane operator wiped out the back of my concrete mixer truck as he swung the hod bucket into it. I barely jumped out of harms way as I caught it coming out of the corner of my eye. After that I wouldn’t let a union operator lower my truck down over the spillway we were pouring during an earth fill dam project. It required chaining the truck to a D-9 Cat as the slope became close to perpendicular at the bottom.My parents went through two world wars and the great depression so that was the way I was raised. Just to lay some background on building in our history I might explain what you’d be dealing with today.During the great depression there are many great stories of accomplishment which will never be equaled. During that time period there are many great stories about accomplishments such as the Golden Gate Bridge ,which only took just over three years to build from January 5, 1933 until May 27, 1937. Men would be camped out waiting in line for someone to fall to their death and the contractors would hire a person to take their place. The golden gate bridge was one of the 20th centuries 7 wonders of the world.Also built during the great depression was the Empire State Building which only took 15 1/2 months including a winter from January 22, 1930 until May 1, 1931 which was another of the 20th century’s seven wonders of the world.It only took Five years to build the Hoover Dam during the depression as well. The contractors were allowed seven years starting on April 20, 1931. The concrete in the dam was completed on May 29, 1935. The reason it took so long is only because of the time it took a concrete pour to cure (dry) ENOUGH before the next pour. (If it was all poured at once, it would have taken 125 years for the concrete to completely cure.) As it is it is still curing after 83 years and getting stronger all the time. A project worth putting on your “bucket list” if you’re at all interested in engineering or even accomplishments of mankind. All features of the dam, including the 16 generators were completed by March 1, 1936.I have to chuckle when I see reports talking about how Trump cheated workers out of money and didn’t pay them for services rendered. What they don’t mention is that contractors failed to live up to their contracts, they hired illegal immigrants without general knowledge and were held to many re-do’s because of failures in construction. Construction of Trump Tower, as one example, started in September of 1980 and was completed in July 1982 just under 2 years with modern day tools and equipment. The left leaning Wikipedia article is filled with false propaganda and half truths, which is par for the course. Every project today is filled with similar problems, delays, and work stoppages, due to corner cutting, at times poor craftsmanship, laziness, and even strikes. I can attest to that as I’ve seen it all of those during my lifetime. It’s just expected as business-as-usual today.Back to your question, what you might expect in our modern world of so called ""progress"" as commonly referred to by progressives.If you owned a business and fired people solely because of their political beliefs you sound like you’d be a radical yourself running the proposed business. However, when we refer to people as liberals and conservatives only, we tend to paint with too broad a brush, which is done far too often today as well.Conservatives tend to believe in an honest day’s pay for an honest day’s work. If you work hard and keep your nose clean you should be a success is more or less their motto. Also, conservatives believe that one should be promoted by merit and ability to do the job only instead of seniority only, which liberals, unions, and Democrats believe. Actually only the hard working model works as it should. The model of the times when people were thankful to even have their jobs instead of expecting to have them, which is far too common today.On the other hand liberal Democrats seem to believe that private enterprise business’s are bad to begin with so they will usually not strive to be successful as far too many tend to think the world owes the a living. Democrats fall into the category of being liberals and tend to depend on unions whether they be skilled crafts, government employees, and even teachers unions to even get elected. They tend to be more corrupt than conservatives. Once your business depends on union workers you may as well close the doors, because no matter how successful the business is the workers eventually will despise you for making more money than they do. (The Bernie Sanders worshipers) They usually are told by their leaders to believe they don’t make enough. You can never pay a union member enough to suit them. You can’t fire a union member as the leaders make it impossible by organizing the rest of the “group” to slow down, strike, or even sabotage your business at times.So the bottom line is that if you plan to start a business, keep it a non-unionized family business, preferably in a right-to-work state, which more and more states are becoming, as they’re aware of the all the corruption and problems which come with organized, unionized, labor. Hopefully we’ll get rid of the federal teachers unions and, once again, become a world leader in education someday in the futures, but that is only the wildest of dreams today.That will take a revolution, which is actually sprouting up all over and beginning to take some roots with our the young generation today. I’m afraid that the “millennial generation,” in large part, about 1/3, may be known someday as the lost generation unless of course they win with their socialistic philosophy. Then we’ll be just another third world country.The only hope in eliminating so much waste in governmental jobs and so called service unions is to privatize much of their services that we depend on today. For that to materialize the Democrat Party, which is actually the problem party is going to need to change and become part of the solution and not the party of hate, obstruction, and destruction in this country.Just listen to them on a daily basis. Ten minutes of CNN and MSNBC will make you so depressed you’ll begin to believe Armageddon started yesterday.Get over that. Get a life and remember, today is the first day of the rest of your life. You CAN make a difference as long as you know the past, know how the problems started, and how to avoid more destruction in the future.We have far too many philosophers, sociologists, and history majors and too few skilled labors in the world today. If we’re ever taken over by socialist dictators the lazy, spoiled, disruptive obstructionists will be the first of be eliminated. The skilled labors and hard working people will always be necessary for the country to survive.",50,0,12,113,0,1

7,How would you absolve the US of its budget deficit as well as national debt?,Fiscal Responsibility,Sovereign Debt,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Very simple, by doing what socialists thought was going to happen 120 years ago:Turning the public infrastructure of the banking system[1] [2] from a private, profit motive-driven, all-encompassing and debilitating parasite[3][4] into a non-profit public utility, abolishing and forbidding interest[5] , funding the new bank with a capital/land tax[6] and untaxing labor while socialising the rest of all nationally critical infrastructure everyone needs (housing, electric utilities, roads, transport, education, natural resources, healthcare, etc.).The reason it hasn’t happened yet is because it’s been opposed by the rentier capitalists (monopolists, speculators, landlords and most of all bankers) for hundreds of years. They saw what was coming in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and they fought back. Rentier/financial capitalism is not the same as industrial capitalism, by the way. Though we have won a significant victory in the last hundred years, which is to get off the dreadful gold standard.I believe in time, we will succeed with this broader goal as well though it will be most difficult in your country of America than the rest of the west, because the neoliberal/neoclassical and austrian school propaganda there has been more profoundly successful. With the success, a “budget deficit” will be called a public investment and governments won’t even be in debt at all because they will issue their own currency unlike today.A “budget deficit” is really a twisted way of saying a public investment. When the government runs a so-called “budget deficit”, it is putting more money into the economy than it is taking out or recycling through tax. It can do so because it issues the currency - or it was supposed to, but that function was deliberately captured by private bankers.Footnotes[1] Banks borrow from the public and create the money supply.

1,"How can the scope of the federal government (USA) be reduced, and thereby reduce the power of the two major political parties?",Political Philosophy,Political Parties,1!,1!,1!,1!,"My thoughts.What must be done first is to eliminate all the amendments that were unconstitutionally declared ratified and/or simply unconstitutional. Some State Constitutions would have to be amended also.The problem that pinpoints why the following Amendments must be eliminated is the fact that the Republic was willfully destroyed, by mainly lawyers, when the SCOTUS, lawyers, stated that the unconstitutionality of these is a political issue and the court won't entertain suits against them. The courts, lawyers, know that most of the powers held by the federal government are not lawful. This, of course, doesn't stop the courts from incarcerating and fining people for supposed violations of them.The ""Constitutional scholar"" generally gets the title after being instructed by other constitutional scholars who have also been taught, or perhaps indocrinated would be a better word, by previous ones. Since most of this instruction is in an academic environment, one must adhere to teachings in order to pass and be awarded with basically a ""Constitutional Scholar"" Certificate.One problem with this is any falsehoods, accidental and intentional, entering the teachings can perpertrated as facts for future scholars. These ""new"" facts are also taught to the general population to encourage their acceptance.Another area is that proper English word usage and meanings along with English concepts of implicit vs explicit, context defining meaning of words with multiple definitions, etc.Now consider that all of the Founders did not want a Republic where all political power rested in the People. Consider a scenario where certain seemingly innocuous but well-understood phrases were inserted into the Constitution with the idea of using them to undermine and eventually destroy the American Republic.Far fetched? Maybe not.Americans have accepted unconstitutional actions by the government because unelected judges have amended the Constitution by simply issuing a ruling that said those actions were OK.One example is the Kelo decision. With the stroke of a pen the SCOTUS drasticly amended the Constitution by the simple method of ""redefining"" the words ""Public use"" from the longstanding understanding to mean, essentually, anything the government deems a benefit. A company wants certain properties to build a mall? No problem since that will bring in more tax revenue and that's a good public use. Dozens of citizens who have lived there for years displaced? Sacrifices must be made.Americans are taught that the Founders created the federal Constitution. This is misleading because not all of them wanted a Republic. Some wanted a monarchy; some a pure democracy; some an oligarchy. Those against a republic, in my opinion, worked to have seemingly innocuous provisions inserted whose language could be used to destroy said republic. Provisions for each House of Congress to make it's own rules with no oversight has led to the members excluding themselves from laws they pass. Setting outrageous pension benefits for themselves.Another seemingly warranted provision that is at the core of the republic's destruction is found in Article 1, Section 8. This gives Congress exclusive jurisdiction over the District of Columbia.Let's start with the alleged 14th Amendment. The former Confederate States, after being welcomed back into the Union and after voting to ratify the 13th Amendment, were refused their right to Suffrage after refusing to ratify the 14th. The Northern Congressmen refused to seat those former Confederate Congressmen. They then passed the Reconstruction Acts that called for the military occupation of those States; the overthrow of the duly-elected officials and the appointment of replacements by Congress. These appointed officials then voted to ratify the amendment. Still think its constitutional?Among other things, this alleged amendment created a new citizen, all of us now, that is a subject of the federal government. These new citizens have no Rights, only immunities and privileges granted by the federal government. Some of these mimic those enumerated in the Bill of Rights and create the impression that you have Rights protected by the Constitution. These federal citizens, actually chattel, are deemed to be citizens of the Seat of Government, DC, and as such subject to any and all whims of the federal government.""Privileges and immunities clause of Fourteenth Amendment protects only those rights peculiar to being citizen of federal government; it does not protect those rights which relate to state citizenship.""Jones v. Temmer, Federal Supplement, Vol. 829, Page 1227 (1993)The fourteenth amendment created citizenship of the federal government. This status is a privilege granted by the government.""We have cited these cases for the purpose of showing that the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States do not necessarily include all the rights protected by the first eight amendments to the Federal Constitution against the powers of the Federal government. They were decided subsequently to the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment...""Maxwell v. Dow, 176 US 598 (1900)That is why we have go pay the government for the privilege of getting married; of using the public roads; and even having a pet. Still think you are free?The 15th for the same reasons as the 14th. This one forbade the several States from disallowing non-state, these aforementioned federal citizens, from voting. Having non-state citizens vote in State elections is the same as having non-citizens, foreigners, vote today. Remember, only the several State Citizens could vote in Presidential elections. These new citizens would have been considered aliens since they were not Citizens of one of the several States. Note that it took a Constitutional amendment to allow citizens of the District of Columbia to vote for President. These 14th Amendment citizens are deemed to be citizens of the District of Columbia since that is the Seat of the federal government.The 16th which was not properly ratified because some states modified the wording before voting which should have mandated that it be returned to Congress, tge changes debated and ibcorpirated or nit, and then resubmitted. This amendment was unlawfully declared ratified by Secretary of State Alexander Knox. This is claimed to allow the federal government to tax everybody but it is more insidious. The feds already had that authority under Article 1 Section 8. This alleged amendment was to divert the people's attention away from the actuality of the fact that they, we, own nothing; all our property is owned and taxable by the feds.That is why the SCOTUS ruled that the government can take your property for any reason and give it to anyone else despite the clear wording of the Constitution specifying public useThe 17th which is itself unconstitutional since it violates the very clause that sets out the amendment process. Mainly that no state shall be denied it's Right of Suffrage. All the States voting ""No"" were denied their Right. This removed the last vestige of the old Republic, the several States control of the Senate. The bureaucrats now have direct control over their territories. Sound familiar? The people have been given the illusion of electing candidates but are simply choosing from a list of pre-selected clones.The courts stated that we must rely on the very people who created and are enriched by this treachery to correct it. Yeah, like that is ever going to happen.Rescind the Buck Act which created federal areas overlaying the several States. This is one other way the feds control the citizenry.Since the Constitution does not delegate to the federal government the authority to have land except for those expressly set forth, all lands, including parks, forests, monuments, etc., How about an Amendment that these supposed federal lands revert back to the respective several state.",181,3,14,38,0,0

You participate in it or you don’t. You go to the post office. You see someone in military uniform. You spend a dollar. You go to a city council meeting or you don’t. You get a ticket, and you pay it or go to court. And only the first three of those reflect the federal government. We may or may not agree with the laws passed, but it’s functioning as designed for the most part simply to handle the administrative and executive minutia of being a country.A government is simply a defined scheme for channeling much of the legal, financial and military concerns of a nation. Read, Article One of the United States Constitution, and, yeah, there have been some unfortunate deviations, but not all that many. The administrative state, very much on the other hand, is designed to be intrusive into our lives.

1,Why is the District of Columbia still Democratic and not Republican?,Democratic Party vs. Republican Party,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"It is true that Washington, D.C. generally votes Democratic. There are several reasons for this. For one thing, it is not a state, but is administered under the aegis of Congress, from which it must directly receive its monies. It has a mayor and City Council, but the power of the purse strings belongs to Congress. There is therefore not a layer of state or county government that can oversee and manage tax breaks for businesses and generally encourage business, which is largely a feature of Republican philosophy. The other reason is that Republicanism tends to favor small government, and is often openly hostile to the federal government, which has enormous influence (of course) in DC. Finally, African Americans have been reliably Democratic voters for several decades now, ever since the Great Shift in politics, when Southern Democrats largely joined the Republican party. However, the Democratic nature of DC has limited influence, since they don’t elect any national figures except the president, vice president, and a non voting proxy in Congress, who for many years was Eleanor Holmes Norton.",64,0,4,120,0,0

Otherwise, they’d get their way and laws would be passed willy-nilly and have all kinds of crazy side effects.I agree with most “leftist” positions:Racism is for idiots.Health care should not be a for-profit industry.Executives shouldn’t be taking in hundreds or thousands of millions of dollars a year when their workers can’t feed their families, despite working three jobs (or more) between them and their spouse.Religion needs to GtFO of politics.College or advanced vocational training should be free to everyone so they have the opportunity to become productive citizens.Citizen’s United needs to be overturned via Constitutional Amendment, pronto.Clean energy is a must (though that does include nuclear).There is nothing wrong with gays/tgs, or with them getting married or adopting kids, and while I don’t understand this four thousand genders idea, it doesn’t hurt me so why should I care what someone wants to call themself?Republicans are just plain wrong on a lot of those. On some, we can compromise and see how it goes. On others, it’s principle.But.This whole ban guns schtick? It needs to stop. Guns are not the problem. Violent crime is a problem (though, a shrinking one!)Hundreds of millions of guns in this country never shoot anyone. A fraction of a fraction of a percent are involved in crime. Anyone who has studied history should realize this is a freaking miracle of modern civilization, as homo sapiens and their ancestors have spent hundreds of thousands of years killing each other with anything they could get their clever little hands on.And the ones being used are of an entirely different type than what banners are most vocally afraid of; a couple dozen rifles over all the years and decades since the first legislation barring sales to criminals have been used in crime, responsible for so few deaths, they are hidden by simple rounding in the statistics. Handguns are the firearm of choice for the shady elements; and no, banning those won’t change that.Banning guns of any or even every sort won’t stop murder or assault; even if you succeed in eliminating them, humans have always had other weapons.Sticks, clubs, bats, canes, batons, flails, spears, swords, axes, knives, and all manner of various and sundry improvised murdery doohickeys will always be available.Folks over in London are so freaked out over knife crime right now that they’re trying to ban knives—kitchen knives!—that haven’t had their sharp points ground off and dulled.Excuse me?! What use is a dull knife? There’s a reason chefs’ knives have points, people… and a knife ban still does nothing about most of that list up there! Not to mention how silly it is to ban knives.They do have legitimate uses.And so do guns.I realize some people think it’s barbaric to defend oneself from violence with violence. I say, better to be a live barbarian than a soggy red corpse with empty pockets.So, when I go for a hike in the woods, I have a revolver on my hip and an actual high-powered rifle (.308 Winchester, no piddly 5.56 for big game here, thx, don’t need the game wardens mad at me for letting one get away!) over my shoulder.And if I ever find myself needing to walk in the less safe parts of the concrete jungle for some crazy reason, well, I have something for that, too. With an 18 round standard capacity magazine.And yes, I own one of the dread rifles of doom and apocalypse. Oddly enough, it has never killed anyone. But ya know what? When “the big one” hits and West Coast civilization gets knocked to the dark ages for a while? I’ll be able to defend myself when things get lawless.No, I am not “looking for a fight.” No, I don’t live in fear.Well, except maybe a little bit that one afternoon we had a real, genuine crazed murderer hiding somewhere in the neighborhood, after shooting a cop in the face on a traffic stop a few streets north of here.

I was prepared.The fire extinguisher, first aid kit, battery charger, jumper cables, tire gauge, air compressor, blanket, emergency stove, emergency food/water, road flares, spare leash, fire starters, and emergency shelter tucked in the hidden compartment of my car are there just in case, too.

2,Why does the Democratic Party receive such a lare portion of the minority vote when historically democrats were slave owners?,Democratic Party (US politics),Republican Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"A lot of it comes from Barry Goldwater. He had opposed the Civil Rights act of 1964, believing it to be an overreach by the federal government. Although not personally a racist, he believed that the government should not legislate behavior, believing that private businesses should be allowed to discriminate based on race. The story grew in the telling over the years, until it was believed that hatred of blacks, Hispanics, and other minorities is mainstream in the GOP.The idea that the parties suddenly switched positions in the 1960s is a load of bull. The Civil Rights Act passed pretty overwhelmingly by both parties: 82% of Republicans and 78% of Democrats.There’s also the map of the 1976 Presidential election:Jimmy Carter managed to win almost the entire South in his rise to the Presidency.There’s also the 1992 and 1996 elections. Even then, Clinton managed to win some of the Southern states.The south didn’t become solidly Republican until 2000 and even then, Obama managed to win Virginia and North Carolina in 2008.Although that’s a major reason, another is that they haven’t done much to try and win black voters over, something even black conservatives criticize them for.

The Republican Party had been a minority party (sometimes a small minority party) for almost all of the period from 1932–1968. So capturing a big bloc of voters the Democrats were moving away from, merely because of their odious views on racial hierarchy, seemed like a potential route back to more national power. And a no-brainer for a guy like Nixon, whose views on race were pretty appalling himself.Had the Republican Party stuck to its more progressive views from the Teddy Roosevelt Era (or even the Eisenhower Era) it would probably have maintained a large share of minority voters.

LBJ was quoted as saying that the Democrats would lose the South, which turned out to be true. Some of those Dixicrats became Republicans, (Strom Thurmond for example). To answer your question, the answer is Blacks and Hispanics tend to vote Democratic is largely due to Democratic Party issues like Voting Rights and Civil Rights.",15,0,8,78,0,0
2,Why does the Democratic Party receive such a lare portion of the minority vote when historically democrats were slave owners?,Democratic Party (US politics),Republican Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"Well, “historically” is utterly immaterial.Political parties are not “chartered” by the Constitution with a set of membership rules, policy requirements, etc. They are simply made up of the people who claim them at the time.When one looks at the ebb and flow of (the many) different parties throughout U.S. history - they have changed positions constantly: been more or less “Liberal” or “Conservative” at any given moment. So, this idea that “Republicans” or “Democrats” have held the same beliefs throughout time is simply nonsense used to spin people’s sense of loyalty.Even in just the last few decades, Parties have evolved significantly and barely resemble their party’s positions from as little as a decade before. For example, the current GOP is more similar to the Tea Party of 2005, with the GOP of 2005 behaving as what would be considered moderates (or independents) now .And the GOP of 2005 only barely resembled the GOP of Reagan’s era. Ironically, if you were to actually compare policies side-be-side for the last 50 years (removing party affiliation) - you’d find that Reagan’s policies more closely match that of modern day Democrats than current Republicans.This is why comparisons like “The party of Lincoln” are so inane.

He said he can Pardon himself for anything.Somantics.You see a Pardon is also an admission of guilt. So by pardoning himself he is admitting guilt. This almost guarantees an Impeachment if he pardons himself for Conspiracy Against the United States. Not even his most vocal defenders can reasonably back that.Blanket Pardons, as in a Pardon that covers any crime, ever committed may not be legal either. The President has unlimited Pardon power but that is not legally the same as a Pardon for unlimited crimes. He has to be specific as to what he is pardoning and failing to do so guarantees that this will end up in front of the Supreme Court.If SCOTUS drags this out he might get voted out of office only to discover that his Pardon doesn’t stand as it lacked specificity. Then he’s screwed if the Prosecutors can make a case.The best lawyers in the GOP keep telling him this but he ignores Grassly and Kennedy and Graham. His own SCOTUS nominee is a guy that from prior rulings would likely not rule for open ended blanket pardons. Ginsburg and Sotomayor would likely strike it down and Samuel Alito is a known stickler. That’s 4. John Roberts isn’t giving anyone an unlimited blanket Pardon. Not if it’s not spelled out specifically so, like Alito. Kagen might be partisan. Which means Clarence Thomas might need to be really persuasive.This statement was never meant to make himself out to be invincible. It was meant to distract from the new Mannafort development that ole Paul is even dumber or more brazen than we thought. He openly attempted to witness tamper and did it visibly.Trump will have to Pardon Mannafort. Or Mannafort flips but Mannafort accepting the Pardon is essentially admitting to treason. Mannafort is screwed and has screwed up Trump because Mannafort has demonstrably, actively colluded with the Russians.If Trump had just let Mannafort go early this might not even be a thing but he didn’t do that. Mannafort has exposed Jr. and Kushner as well.Nothing, so far, has implicated the boss though. Pardoning Mannafort won’t make this go away either because any sign of weakness after that and the GOP will turn on him.Rudy Giuliani should stay off television. He is running a PR campaign but doing it in ways that might guarantee an appearance before the Supreme Court. He is exacerbating legal challenge potentials not putting out fires. He argued that Presidents can’t obstruct Justice even though that is exactly what happened with Nixon. It’s the one crime a President can effectively be charged with, though not while seated.This is silly really. That No One is Above the Law has always been an accepted axiom. Maybe President Trump pushes this but he might not like the results. Maybe the Supreme Court lets this go but the way he handled his first Pardon, with Joe Arpaio, put him and the courts on alternate paths. That fence can be mended but not if he keeps kicking out boards.Trump likes to make bold sweeping claims but then backs down when it’s time to put up.

When Republican Roy Moore was accused (and of much more serious transgressions), others in the Republican Party, including the current POTUS, were quick to rally to his defense. He continued his bid to become a Senator. Fortunately, there were enough sane voters left to keep him from winning the election.So, whatever the ratio, it is totally irrelevant.

After the Depression, the New Deal ushered in an era of financial regulation that led to half a century of unprecedented stability in banking and finance. Reagan had the bright idea of deregulating finance and his first major legislative victory, the Garn-St Germain Act of 1982 led directly to the S&L crisis and bailout a few years later. Republicans had the brilliant insight that the disastrous failure of S & L deregulation meant that more and broader deregulation was just the ticket, and the string of subsequent disasters such as the Long Term Capital Management bailout of 1998, the Asian Crisis of 1997, the Enron failure, the AIG bailout, and the 2008 collapse and massive bank bailout all stem from various deregulatory moves.

The conclusion speaks for itselfPoint #1 – FALSE NARRATIVE - “Politifact truth-o-meter: Stock Market does better under Democratic Presidents than Republican Presidents”… Just read their article, Politifact’s truth-o-meter Article has expressed their opinion that the stock market is irrelevant.What does this mean? This is FAKE NEWS.Point #2 – FALSE NARRATIVE – “Nine of the last ten recessions have occurred under Republican Presidents.” First, the Quora article is based on quotes from a Forbes article, which shows multiple charts covering the “President” not “Congress” as the measure (False Narrative). The Job Growth chart shows that the Charts are based upon the Presidential terms from Truman (1945) to 2016. All statistics quoted from the Forbes Report must be based upon the same 70 years. For purposes of updating, I included 2017, which makes negligible differences in the other statistical outcomes.What does this mean? There were 12 recessions, not 10 recessions during this period. The 12 recessions started under Congress’s House and Senate, as 9 were fully Democrat controlled, 2 were split party controlled and 1 was fully Republican controlled. The statistics were cherry-picked, removing the first 2 Democratic governed recessions for the total.Point #3 – FALSE NARRATIVE – “Democratic presidents create nearly twice as many jobs per year as Republican Presidents.” Congress makes the jobs, not the president. Counting jobs does not account for the current employment rate. There will be fewer jobs created once an economy is in full swing. The proper statistic is the Unemployment Rate. However, IF jobs are to be counted then the percentage of new public versus private-enterprise jobs tells the story of government’s prior failure to fix the economy.What does this mean? The average unemployment rate is: 5.55% for fully Democrat controlled Congress; 4.70% for fully Republican controlled Congress; and 7.41% for split control of Congress. On average, 18% more unemployment under the Democrats and the split Congress created 41% more unemployment than the average of both parties.Point #4 – FALSE NARRATIVE – “Republican presidents' deficits are 25% larger than Democrats' and 63% higher as a percent of GDP.” Deficits by themselves have little meaning. Deficits must be compared to the GDP, which is why the Deficit/GDP ratio is published, as a percentage.What does this mean? The average annual Deficit/GDP is as follows: 2.48% for fully Democrat controlled Congress; 0.44% for fully Republican controlled Congress; and 4.00% for split control of Congress. On average, a 465% greater Deficit/GDP ratio under the Democrats compared to Republicans and the split Congress created 274% more unemployment than the both-parties average.Point #5 – FALSE NARRATIVE – “GDP grows 44% faster under Democratic Presidents..” The average annual % GDP Growth Rate is as follows: 2.86% for fully Democrat controlled Congress; 3.14% for fully Republican controlled Congress; and 2.60% for split control of Congress.What does this mean? On average, 10% more annual % GDP Growth Rate under the Republicans, while the split Congress created 13% less annual GDP Growth Rate than the both-parties average. This also means that within a single 8-year Presidential term, with a Republican Congressional majority, the GDP could have grown 22% larger over the 72-year study period if Congress were under Republican control.Point #6 – FALSE NARRATIVE – “Business investment has grown twice as fast under Democratic Presidents than under Republican Presidents” The average annual Business Investment (1945 – 2017) (in Billions) is as follows: $193.41 Billion for fully Democrat controlled Congress; $628.17 Billion for fully Republican controlled Congress; and $489.87 Billion for split control of Congress.What does this mean? On average, 325% more annual Business Investment under the Republicans and the split Congress created 19% more annual Business Investment than the average of both parties.Conclusion?

1,"Which President faced more opposition from Democrats, Trump or Lincoln?",Abraham Lincoln,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"Although I can see Brandon Wilson's point -- this is less a legitimate question and more passive-aggressive partisanship masquerading as a question -- I think it is worth a straightforward response.Abraham Lincoln's election led to the succession of a group of states, one of which attacked a federal fort, precipitating a disastrous civil war. Our political partisanship does not come close to that level of intensity today, and, I must add, we must all hope that it does not. The American Civil War, as horrible as it was, at least divided the nation by geographic regions. If today's cultural divisions ever escalated to the level of war, the result would be community fighting nextdoor community, neighbor fighting neighbor. Citizens would experience war itself more as citizens of the former Yugoslavia experienced the Balkan War at the close of the 20th Century, and regardless of who won, would find themselves in a second tier nation as a result of that war.As to the level of opposition to President Trump, I do not think that either partisan wing is looking at this through clear glasses. Our nation's relationship with the presidency has been in a downward spiral for several decades now. The presidency has passed back and forth between the two parties, but regardless of which party is in and which out, each presidency has been assailed more intensely than the previous one, in terms of the president actually being legitimate. And meanwhile, each administration has made more extreme claims about the absolute nature of presidential power.So the more useful questions would proceed in this vein:Who faced more insane opposition from the out-party, Donald Trump or Barack Obama? Barack Obama or George W. Bush? George W. Bush or Bill Clinton? Bill Clinton or Ronald Reagan? Ronald Reagan or Jimmy Carter? etc.Just to clarify, I am not talking about political opposition to the proposed policies and programs and priorities of the sitting president. I am talking about the wide array of claims, accepted by increasing numbers of citizens in the out-party tent, that the man in the White House has no real right to hold the job until the next election.Sadly, I realize that most people reading this post are die-hard partisans of one wing or the other, and will generally respond, ""It's totally different. The presidents of the other party really deserved all that abuse. But the treatment of my presidents -- totally unjust."" That's what a death spiral looks like.Your original question kind of outsmarts itself. You are so, so busy trying to tie Abraham Lincoln to today's Republicans, and the Democrats of the mid 19th Century to today's Democrats. A silly conceit in any case, given the number of issues on which the two parties have traded positions over the past century and a half.

Devin Nunes used his position as the Chair of the House Intel committee to “discover” and announce that this came about because of Obama White House politically motivated surveillance of the Trump campaign. (In fact, it came to light because of routine surveillance of known Russian spies and operatives.) Before that happened, I would have “known” that such abuse of a chairmanship would have led to immediate revocation of that position; that Speaker Ryan, who controls that, would have had to take that action.

5,When will Robert Mueller’s investigation produce a guilty plea on a meaningful charge instead of all theses meaningless charges?,U.S. Special Counsel Investigation (2017-present),1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Meaningless, you say?Money laundering for a foreign power is a meaningless charge? Lying to the FBI is a meaningless charge? Acting as an undisclosed agent of a foreign power is a meaningless charge?None of the indictments issued by Mueller so far are small potatoes, at least as far as those facing them are concerned - ultimately, there’s going to be a lot of jail time involved, along with asset seizures. It’s true: so far the charges have only been laid at the feet of some of the outliers of the Trump Campaign, but we also know that several of those thus indicted have bargained for a plea deal with Mueller.That in itself is suggestive of several things:First off, it indicates that Mueller isn’t overly interested in people like Gates, Flynn and Manafort: he’s looking to go higher up the food chain, likely looking at the actions of Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and perhaps even Donald Trump himself. The indictments are clear evidence of wrongdoing, and they’ll pay for their actions, but the plea bargains suggest that they have information pertinent to Mueller.It needs to be noted that the methodology that Mueller is using is similar to that used by the FBI to deal with mob bosses: you start with the small guys at the bottom of the pyramid, charge them for their offenses, but offer them deals for leniency if they co-operate by handing over incriminating material on their superiors. Slowly, you build up a case against the guys at the top of the pyramid: all built on the backs of the little guys.It’s certainly true that we’ve yet to see charges leveled against Kushner, Trump Jr. and others higher up in the Trump Campaign, but that isn’t to say that those aren’t coming - at present, Mueller seems to be working on getting Trump himself to testify (which would speed the investigation along considerably), but there’s no doubt that Mueller has more to serve up yet.It’s also worth noting that Mueller has issued a significant number of indictments compared to other investigations against high-profile political figures, and has done so in a rather short space of time. A year might seem like a long period, but in terms of these types of investigations, it’s not overly significant - the Watergate investigation took more than two years before it gained any results!Also, just for reference, obtaining a guilty plea isn’t the point of any investigation: the idea behind that is to obtain sufficient evidence that will convince a jury that misconduct has taken place, regardless of what the defendant pleads. Trump, for example, can claim his innocence until he’s blue in the face (if such is possible with so much orange spray tan!), but that doesn’t mean that he is actually innocent. Mueller’s final report to Congress (and the evidence attached to it) will give a fair indication on that score, and it’ll then be up to Congress to determine the guilt or innocence of the President.Be patient: Mueller’s not done yet. You can guarantee that there’ll be more charges and indictments to come, but given that the targets are fairly likely to be higher up the food-chain than Gates, Manafort, Papadopoulos and Flynn, it’s fair to say that Mueller needs to make sure that the evidence is utterly incontrovertible before going after those he’s looking at.",12.1k,389,1.4k,"1,931",0,0

Somehow this has become “meaningless” to many right wingers. But let’s leave that for a moment. Why did he plead guilty and agree to cooperate with the investigation in the first place?The answer is that the prosecution convinced him and his attorneys that they had a very strong case on more serious charges and were almost certainly going to get a conviction. That’s the deal. The prosecution gets cooperation with the investigation, and the defendant gets to plead to a lesser charge with a smaller penalty.So what were the more serious charges? In general, we don’t know. Plea deals are between the prosecution and the defense and are not (AFAIK) generally made public. There’s a strong suspicion that in Flynn’s case they involved violations of FARA, particularly because the statement of offenses filed included both making false statements to the FBI and making “materially false statements and omissions” in document filings required by FARA.But the idea that “all Mueller got” is the lesser charges to which Flynn, Papadopolous, and Gates pled guilty is a serious misrepresentation of events.

We can assume the original list of crimes in every plea deal was even bigger than what we are seeing.Example, a plea deal discussion:Mueller’s Team: “Mr. Flynn, take a look at this — we have clear evidence of you committing SERIOUS CRIME A, which means up to 60 years in prison. We also have clear evidence of you committing SERIOUS CRIME B, which is an automatic 45 years in prison.Mueller’s Team: “Mr. Flynn, We also have evidence of you committing three smaller crimes, MINOR CRIME C, and MINOR CRIME D, and MINOR CRIME E. Those are only 5, and 7, and 8 years in prison.”Mueller’s Team: “Mr. Flynn, Look over all this evidence. Plus, we have more, but that is our own secret. We won’t tell you what all that is. But, we have even more. Now, look over all that evidence in front of you.”Mueller’s Team: “So, Mr. Flynn — do you want to plead guilty to MINOR CRIME C, and MINOR CRIME D, and MINOR CRIME E? —If you do, you will agree to stop lying, and tell us everything, no exceptions, no holding back, one minor boo-boo, and the whole deal is off. If you do, we will drop the two SERIOUS CRIMES. And we will only indict for the three MINOR CRIMES, and we can also ask the judge to be lenient, and these minor crimes might be concurrent sentences, and you might get out of prison in 6 years, instead of 125 years.”That, is a very typical plea bargain. And, you and I will never probably know what all of those other crimes were. Not the “Major Crimes.”This happens every day, and not just at the federal level. It happens in your own town, just to avoid expensive trials, and to avoid the risk of losing at a trial, and having a guilty person walk free.It also happens in a large investigation, to gather new evidence of others who were involved in a conspiracy.

1,"Could having a king actually unite the United States as presidents have allegiance to only the political parties (Democrat and Republican), alienating them from one half of the nation?",Democratic Party vs. Republican Party,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Ive seen the article that made this arguement. It was not taking a position for a classical Monarch so much as a modern Royal Family like the Brits have.Essentially a ceremonial figurehead and a support structure. Ones we could obsess over and personalize as familiars.Super Celebrities.We already have those. For the life of me I can’t figure out why but we do. The Kardashians, “Branjelina”, Beyoncé, Michael Jackson and Elvis.Tellingly, the British Royals are actually more popular here than they are there. So in a sense we already have them.Many Brits will, quite vocally, tell you the monarchy needs to be abolished as a silly and unnecessary expense. Often countered with their value as one of the world’s great tourist attractions.Yet the very concept of a hereditary monarch is completely inadequate for governing a massive super power. No matter how competent the line proves it’s eventually going to spit out a turd. Charles the Second or Mad King George were pretty solid examples considering we fought the revolutionary war to get rid of the Monarchs of the British Empire.Queen Elizabeth has been a solid monarch. Charles seems like a decent guy but he was never as popular as Lady Diana. Their kids seem solid and worthy of dragging this system out but how long until an awkward incompetent is the next in line?Who in America would really qualify?The Kennedy Clan came pretty close to being the default royals but while everyone kind of likes Jack and Bobby, Ted drove half the country batty.Next up are the Bush Family. Two Presidents, a Governor, an entertainment reporter, Dubya’s utterly likable daughters. They’ve also spawned a thousand conspiracy videos on YouTube.Queen Chelsea? That would very like kill 5% of the population from fatal apoplexy.Egad can you image Kim and Kanye as Co-Regents? The Midwest might promptly secede.Yuck, Donald Trump Jr. as the crowned Prince? Or would Ivanka get elevated above her brother? We’ve never elected a Jewish President, how about as monarchs? The Neo NAZIs go full on riot insane.Maybe Bill Gates or Warren Buffet? Super Rich guys might do for our hyper-capitalist tendencies; but wouldn’t that eventually lead to super-monopolies where the American Emperor owned virtually everything?Lets keep something in mind. Americans always disagree. Even when it’s something we actually agree on, at least 1% of the population will either go full troll or at least play devils advocate.Even someone utterly likable, like Tom Hanks and his charming wife and affable son would get some hate if we crowned him an autocrat.We don’t have Kings for the simplest of reasons. George Washington didn’t want the title. Like so many other things, he set a very good example for what a good American actually looks like. Before looking for a monarch, go back and read some of Washington’s letters. He was possibly the last American that virtually everyone was united behind, devoid of politics. Washington warned us about the dangers of political parties and we didn’t listen it might be a good idea to think on his other bits of advice considering our divisive politics is exactly why Washington disliked parties.",212,2,275,"1,377",0,0

In Western Europe - and in many locations in Eastern Europe - this inherited leadership consolidated power and wealth in the hands of a few (through birth) and a few more (through a mix of merit and birth). Similar patterns of consolidation show up in complex societies in Africa, Asia, and South and Central America.Much of the underlying premise behind the US Declaration of Independence and the US Constitution is a rejection of inherited leadership. This is why the US has such a strong myth cycle for the self-made man (or woman) who rises from poverty and ignorance to become a military, industrial, academic, or political leader.It’s also why there’s such a consistent narrative about the second- and third-generations, as they sink back into mediocrity.Our myths don’t really honor inherited power - at least, not now.

Not only is there a rift now, but it’s growing.Progressives are at the front of a labor movement to secure meaningful and equitable economic representation.In general, progressives do not believe in the current party economic vision and strategy. They see it as a general failure and point to the ever increasing number of Americans in real economic trouble today as their case in point.Democrats have helped to bring us a lot of social progress. And that’s all good, but the cost has been severe economically.Now, as the economic costs continue to accrue, faith in the party is on the decline, and that decline is rooted in basic labor economic issues remaining unaddressed for what is going on decades now.Additionally, that lack of faith has translated in to a movement to challenge and reform the party, as well as one to grow a third party.Finally, the social progress is at risk, due to the fact that poor performance and lack of faith has translated in to over 1000 seats lost. The prospect of gains back during the mid-terms is blunted too. Primary challenges, protest votes, third party efforts will all continue to dilute the voting power normally associated with the left, which results in tepid election performance.This is quite the mess!Frankly, I’m with the progressives. We can, should, need, and I would argue, must do better economically, or we are very likely to continue down this authoritarian road with Trump. Not something I want to see personally.It’s time Democrats. Time to return to being a party of the people. Long overdue.Meta update:There has to be a way. I am a Democrat, and I am super pissed at where we have ended up. The left is better than this.If I could say anything to my fellow Dems, upset over Clinton losing, the many seats down, division, talk of party they really believe in being reformed, and that due to failure…First, I get it. Was there. Still am. This all hurts.But, you must know progressives really mean it. This isn't a messaging problem, or some fad, or cult either.In rough terms, a majority of Americans are experiencing unacceptable economic struggles, growing numbers in real trouble. Basic ideas the left holds dear lie at the crux of this mess too.Medicare For All. Issue number one.Living Wages. Issue number two.Access to free college. And student debt is issue number three.Everyone knows those are hard. Money in politics, conflict of interest between donors funding campaigns and the real, growing, human need out there are weighing us all down, preventing progress. And the longer we do not address these things, the more our hard won gains are put at risk, and or see real, material, painful regression.Let me put it very simply:We, the left, need to find a way to put a positive message out there, and the core of it needs to be strong commits to get real progress made on the top issues. When we do that, we give every American something to vote FOR.And that's what progressives are all about. That, right there, is the root of this mess. Talking with people, not AT them. Being FOR something, clearly and with vigor, not just “less worse"" than the GOP, the right, President Trump.People are desperate. They can't afford more of the same politics that got us here. They can't afford, do not get excited about, believe in just being against the worst.Believe it.A lesser evil conversation is still an evil conversation, and when we as a party try to get people behind that, what we are really doing is asking a majority struggling hard to continue doing that so a minority can continue to live well and make progress.Way too many of our fellow Americans need more than that, and they mean it. Have to. It's getting pretty grim.So there has to be a way, or I believe we will continue to struggle, continue to be a tepid check against the right. And while I do not agree with the right on most things, they get to so what they are doing. This is on us, the left, to get out there and show the American people better. We will win, and once again be effective in the body politic too.When we put VOTE FOR politics out there, positive politics, we talk to everyone. They have a reason to get excited, and they will love us for it. More than enough.Even the racists need Medicare for All, for example. Think about that.Think about the social progress possible when we are that much harder to oppose coming off a very successful campaign, movement to make things really better for everyone.Think about the economic progress possible when we relieve some of the brutal cost and risk exposure most Americans face today.I do. A lot.I urge you to do the same. And while you think those thoughts with me, know that fear, blame and shame aren't effective tools. When people get desperate, those things only make it worse.They fear not being able to see the doctor. They are ashamed they can't feed their kids, and they blame our leadership for general failure to represent them economically, meaningfully enough to give them the fighting chance they need to take care of themselves and theirs, same as you and me.Using those things in some attempt to get votes while avoiding real issues is laughable, on a good day, often rage inducing otherwise, and either way, the door to us, to reach the people, secure the votes we need, is often slammed shut. Hard.And that is what the left is about. We either step up and show America what an economic and social left is, or the people are increasingly likely to squabble and lose seeking it themselves.Progress isn't something we can take for granted. Implicit ideas, like being less worse than an opponent, implies good. But that isn't what most Americans have seen.Real progress requires an explicit commitment to that common, public, good, or it just won't happen. This rift is about that too.Think about it. I urge you. There just has to be a way. The left is better than this.Time to show Americans just what all that can mean.",457,15,3.5k,"2,657",0,0

They are beholden only to the people and they should carry that distinction like a flag, wave it proudly and wrap themselves in the integrity it would bestow.The rift that has grown within the Democratic Party can be repaired if all Dems focus on the very real economic struggles that millions of our citizens are going through every day. The 2016 Democratic Platform had a bunch of good stuff in it. http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/p... But having created what was probably the best platform put together in my voting life the party went on to . . . not talk about it. Instead the party went to war with Trump and his supporters and got caught up in a battle of words rather than ideas.Democrats need to go back to the ideas in that platform and actually talk about them. There were plans for out of work coalminers, but no one bothered to tell most coalminers that. There were plans to strengthen healthcare and make college more affordable. Gosh, who knew? Within that platform are ideas all Democrats can get behind. If we become a party of ideas instead of just being “not Trump” we can win back much of what’s been lost.",234,18,6.6k,"5,069",0,1

That took Slick Willie Clinton Clinton browbeating Congress to pass it and his signing it into law.

Carter also very carefully ignored this costs on citizens of the Nixon drug war. And a failure to act when one has the power to do so IS an active agreement to comply with the status quo. (Doubt me?

Some effort should be put into educating Americans about policy, but because people have shorter attention spans and little patience, it does not work.This is why Trump’s tweet and public mood swings are so good at grabbing media attention.

You can see some of those policies brought up during President Obama’s administration, such as Obamacare (a move towards single-payer healthcare), hostility to oil, gas and coal businesses, higher taxes on small business, promotion of minority positions in race, sex and social perspective, and a generally proto-socialist economic worldview. The problem for the Democrats is that American voters generally dislike those kinds of policies, meaning the Democrats have advanced them through court actions and when they enjoyed Congressional majorities.As a result, at this time Democrat candidates are less likely to buy into a national DNC platform, and more likely to promote their own programs and positions likely to be popular in their congressional district or state.If the Democrats are able to claim a congressional majority this fall, then you will see a more consistent platform presented as they caucus for legislation.

Moral equivalence: we’re all whores and we’re all covered in shit.That’s straight out of the bad theology of John Piper. It’s a big money maker. If Obama had pardoned Democrat Rod Blagojevich for the moral equivalence of making Scott Pruit the head of EPA and Devos the head of Education and Ross the head of Commerce and Trump’s favorite lawnjockey, Ben Carson (with Clarence Thomas, it makes a matched set for bookends), impoverished Evangelical pastors wouldn’t have to make empassioned pleas for Dessault Falcon 7 jets, the preferred fuck-and-fly ride for the Cannes-Tel Aviv set.

Republican policy and ideals have never addressed the future or any foreseen problems of tomorrow with anything approaching rationale or logic.Take for instance…automation and “The Gray Wave”.Automation is coming for us. There will be self driving cars, trucks, stores,…everything. Those jobs are going away. Democrats propose tossing more money at education, lowering tuition to make it easier to obtain a degree, and hopefully get ahead of it. Retraining or at least offering people the option to move into a different sector that isn’t automation friendly, is a logical solution to a problem like that.Republicans are trying to bring back coal jobs, and reduce tax revenue that could be used to bolster education.“The Gray Wave” is the Baby Boomer generation coming into retirement or aging out of the workforce.

2,Should the democrats move toward the center to ensure victory in the coming midterm election as Sam Harris argues? Is Trump simply the backlash of white identity cultural politics against liberal cultural values?,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Yes and noDemocrats needs to tailor their candidates to certain districts and states. And luckily they have been doing that.What I mean by that is have candidates that are both center, a little to the right and of course to the left but make sure it fits right. So Say places like NY,MA, CA etc places like these democrats can afford being to the left because a lot of their constitutes are to the left. Its why someone like Kamala Harris appears to the left of a lot of her co leagues its because her state allows her to go to a certain degree to the left. Take Kristen Gillibrand she was a conservative blue dog democrat before she came to the senate. Reason being she represented a more conservative leaning district in the house. Once she got to the senate she went left because one now that she was representing all of NY she had more room to maneuver. She chose to go left and so far that has worked for her based on her reelection results.Now places like AL, WV, MO the democrats there need to be either center or right leaning. Joe Manchin has been a reliable conservative democrat. Claire Mccaskill and Doug Jones have been good at being moderate. Tailor the candidate to the state and districts and let it run its course.And since there are on average more right leaning states than democratic if democrats continued this and keep on winning seats and keeping some senators it will just naturally keep the party at the center. You only start to veer off center when a party gets rid of its moderates and liberal republicans or conservative democrats. My State of NY allows someone like Chuck schumer to go left if he wants but he chooses to stay moderate. If he ever did go left it wouldn't hurt his chances.Now as for the second part. For the cultural part this is more strictly geared towards evangelicals. There was a backlash but the religious right mainly evangelicals were losing their grip on the US. They have already lost two generations as more and more youth turn away from faith. They lost on gay marriage forever as now nearly 70% of people agree with gay marriage. About twenty years ago that was only 30%. Abortion is still legal and doesn't seem to be going anywhere even with a conservative supreme court. You have more people eschewing traditional marriages and the pews keep getting older with not enough young people to takeover. Then here comes a guy who says he will restore faith in GOD to the country and what not.Now thats not the whole picture. Trumps victory was not so much a backlash to liberal values or culture a lot of trump voters just wanted their old jobs back. You know Manufacturing old factory type jobs a few other type of jobs that have disappeared over the last few decades. Oh coal mining as well. Trump told them what they wanted to hear that he would bring back all those jobs and America's factories would be open again. The mines would open again and coal would return to prominence. Basically he told people he would make America like post WW2 period without the racism and other bad stuff of course. People just wanna work again but not be told the hard truth that their old jobs aren't coming back like they think.

Most voters are reasonable in their expectations and standards.

3,How many of you would support a new third hybrid party based on the best values from Democrats and Republicans?,Democratic Party vs. Republican Party,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"I am afraid that currently the ‘best’ values of both parties are antithetical to each other. And the most important values seem to override each party’s best values.The first line of the 2016 Republican Party Platform, adopted at the Republican Convention says:“We believe in American exceptionalism”. If all of their party planks are resting on this self-serving, self-centered, insulting attitude, it puts a very negative slant on all of their values.The Democrats certainly talk a better talk in their platform but their voting records show that their desire to get re-elected all too often causes them to abandon their ideals and take the easy way out and not fight hard to inspire us to support those ideals and move us to a better place. In addition, the Democrats, with the exception of a few, certainly give lip service and support to the idea of American exceptionalism.As to places where values can be debated; when I taught sixth graders and we discussed government and political parties I used the example of the debate about the federal government instituting a school lunch program in public schools many years ago. Putting the best spin on it for both parties, I put it this way. The Democrats realized that hungry kids were not at their best for the job of learning. They also recognized the disparity between families who had enough time and money to properly feed their children and families that struggled to do so. I characterized the Republican position as concern that the government’s taking over the responsibility of parents to provide a lunch for their children to take to school would actually weaken the family by allowing a different entity to take over a family responsibility.A show of hands said that the kids all recognized the strength of both positions. Another show of hands on how they would vote on the issue had them passing the school lunch bill by a sizable majority on the grounds that ultimately the most important thing was to not let kids go hungry. A few students held out for trying to keep the family strong. But all the kids recognized that both sides had good reasons for their positions.Trying to merge ideals is very difficult but you have to start with people who understand and respect competing priorities.

Conservatives would find me “liberal” in some respects and Liberals would find me “conservative” in other respects.Anyway when I have heard this term used it is usually in regard to socialism. by Americans who think my country, even when ruled by the right wing National party is socialist.Personally after spending all Friday in doctors and then the hospital with my 91 year old mother after a fall I think you would be brainless not to appreciate the health care my country offers everyone. The grand sum total of cost was $45 dollars as it was an accident.Now I will say a conservative will argue that we pay for that in our taxes and in our Accident compensation but nevertheless our health care proportion of taxes is less expensive than the USA.We don’t have a hugely inefficient administration system. Medical billing is not a career track here.So instead of trying to get my mother out of hospital because of the cost, I was trying to get her out of hospital because she was bored out of her brain.My father was a left winger. It’s rather insulting to assume he had not thought through his beliefs. Being affected by the great depression in 1926 had a lot to do with it.By the way being socialist does not mean being unenterprising.

His reasoning was that it was a right that had been fought for and he was not going to abuse it.I don’t see the point of having a society where there is no co-operation at all.

I do not believe or think that it is possible to describe a person as a political belief, thus “being a liberal”, “being a conservative”, is not a description that I can use to describe a human.So what we can describe? Well we can describe a human with certain political view. And the difference between describing a human identified with a political belief and describing the political view(s) of a human, is not a simple semantic difference. When you define a human, as a political belief, such becomes a dogma that defines human, but when you define a person’s political view(s), it describes philosophical readings of that human about some social issues, based on political ideas.In short, I have readings of several political issues, that can be described belonging to this or that political thinking system. All of the following are in European context: For example I am quite conservative about sovereign rights of nation states, emigrants’ rights, some types of crimes and management of natural resources. On the other hand I am liberal about civil rights, autonomy of universities, utility management regulations. I am socialist about social security, health, and basic education services. etc. etc. Some of them can be conflicting in rough reading from the outside, but I think I can convince you for most of my views, especially if you are from a civilised country and can spend some days to talk over these.Also while the question is implying it is expected to see some change in political views, it is a very limited scope of flexibility for my expectation to be able to change my political views, only once while changing from being young to being old.

Board of Education - Black History - HISTORY.comHere were the conservatives during this time, opposing the liberals.""It's Being Black and Poor"": Race, Class, and Desegregation at Pebblebrook HighNow, those liberals may very well be our conservatives voters today. But that does not mean that they totally regressed backwards.You won’t see very many of the proponents of desegregation changing their minds today. They haven’t regressed to trying to bring segregation back to America.Instead the goal posts have simply changed. Today, being liberal means things like supporting gay rights. And if those people who supported desegregation in the past are not able to adjust to supporting gay marriage today, this can make them a conservative.However, it is because the qualifier for liberalism has changed, not because these individuals changed their mind on their former liberal policies. Desegregation is accepted as the norm now, it’s no longer liberal to believe that black people should have equal rights so we no longer see this point of view as a ‘liberal’ one.Today I consider myself a social liberal. I support things like gay rights and the ability for transgender people to transition. Fifty years from now, liberals may be discussing and fighting for changes that I never once considered were equality issues.I may or may not jump on the bandwagon, there’s no way for me to say. I might still be a liberal and wind up supporting the liberals. Or, I might dig my heels in and claim that the new generation of liberals are destroying America. I can’t predict what rights issues will be tackled in fifty years and I’m sure that the liberals fifty years ago didn’t oftentimes stop to think that gay rights were ever going to become a thing.How many conservatives today would genuinely argue that we should bring back Jim Crow and segregation? How many would genuinely argue black people should be slaves again? How many would genuinely argue women should be confined to the home, or not be allowed to vote? How many would genuinely argue marital rape should once again be legalized? How many would genuinely argue that interracial marriage should not be allowed?That’s because those are issues that the liberals won. You may look back on those policies and think that of course you would never support such a thing, because those things were immoral or wrong or oppressed innocent people. But the conservatives in those days were simply protecting and fighting for the commonly held morals and traditions of their time. To them, the idea that a black and white person could marry was absurd and disturbed the moral fabric of society. Think of the children!ABC’s What Would You Do carried out a social experiment on interracial relationships and we could see the difference in opinion over generational lines. These much older women were still very much the product of their time:And I guarantee you decades from now someone may write a post just like me and on it they are going to ask ‘how many of you would genuinely argue that gay people should not be allowed to get married?’ and the conservatives in that day and age are going to have the same reaction you just did. “I’d never support such a thing! That was wrong!”That’s because proponents of gay rights are going to win. The reaction you had to proponents of segregation are going to be the same reactions people are going to have about the opponents of gay marriage today. Social liberals are changing the goal posts, we’re changing the attitudes and traditions and morals of society.The things conservatives fought for fifty years ago probably don’t resemble what conservatives are fighting for today. You may think you are ‘conserving’ morals but in reality you are conserving the present day morals, the ones reshaped by liberals. Perhaps once a long time ago, you were that social liberal who managed to reshape our modern values. Did you march for civil rights? Did you participate in the sexual revolution? Did you fight for women’s equality in the workplace? Did you celebrate when marital rape became illegal?When liberals win the ethics of society change with them.Young, modern day liberals have to understand that many of the conservatives today were just like us in the past. Conservative women today once helped pave the way for me to be able to have equality in the workplace. Conservative men today signed laws that allowed me access to contraception. Modern day conservative men and women paved the way for me to have an interracial relationship. They were the liberals back then.But no, I don’t believe this quote is accurate. Supporting women’s rights in the 1970s does not lead to the logical conclusion of opposing gay rights today, these are not mutually exclusive.It’s more than possible for someone to have been liberal in the past and adapt to liberalism today. Or maybe they were an ultra-liberal back then and were always on board with gay rights. There’s no reason why wanting to halt progress after your time is the logical conclusion of growing older.There may be some arguments around things like economic policy and becoming fiscally conservative when you are older. But if someone is socially liberal and fiscally conservative that doesn’t mean that they are a ‘conservative’, it just means that they have a blend of different policies. A liberal in my opinion is both socially and economically liberal. A conservative is both socially and economically conservative. Someone who is a blend of both may lean to one side or the other or they might simply be a centrist.So to me, the answer is no. There is no reason it is more practical to become both socially and economically conservative as one grows older. If we follow the progression of various social movements in society it makes sense there were people who fought for women’s rights and civil rights and now gay rights, there’s no reason they had to stop after one success.",4.3k,107,4.9k,"4,716",1,2

He was personally coronated by President Obama, who feared a progressive takeover should Keith Ellison have assumed the role as DNC chair. It bears to mention that Keith Ellison wasn’t even the strongest progressive (that would be Sam Ronan, the only candidate to acknowledge the DNC’s cheating of Bernie Sanders during the primary). Still, he represented a threat, so he had to go. This is why he was placed as DNC vice-chair, a figurehead position previously held by Tulsi Gabbard, who, as vice-chair, was actually disinvited from attending the debates. Tom Perez’s shady nomination and the subsequent placement of Keith Ellison in a powerless vice-chair position was the signal to many progressives that the takeover of the DNC was going to be hostile. Hell, even Donald Trump could see that the election of Tom Perez was the DNC choosing to lose rather than embrace a progressive message.Congratulations to Thomas Perez, who has just been named Chairman of the DNC. I could not be happier for him, or for the Republican Party!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 25, 2017
Of course, he didn’t disappoint. under him, DNC fundraising has been in the fucking toilet. In fact, it was in June 2017 (only 4 months after he assumed power) that the director of National Nurses United called for his resignation after he presided over the worst month of fundraising since 2009. This was after his Unity Tour, which basically was him using Bernie as a prop. The Better Deal, a plan they supposedly were crafting for months, was ridiculed as a Papa John’s pizza ripoff (admittedly it wasn’t as bad as I thought it was going to be, but the plan was lukewarm at best and even lacked healthcare reform). Their constant Trump fear-mongering is starting to hit diminishing returns, especially considering the Democrats are actually voting with him on several issues like government spying and military funding.Tom Perez is the establishment’s feckless puppet and his corruption is bordering on incompetence, which is why I signed that petition. The 2020 election is the one that will determine who gets the gerrymander (which, of course, I think is bullshit but none of the parties are going to do anything about it, so here we are).

This is a source of a lot of political claptrap in this country, from “nuclear power is horribly unsafe” on the left to “gay people are paedos” on the right.And a third, for the most conscious and thoughtless users of the phrase, is that “Democrat Party” is not the actual name of the Party, the phrase irritates the members thereof, and there really is nothing in American politics more purely mean-spirited and petty than a dedicated conservative on a rant.",70,2,45,73,0,0
2,Why do many conservatives refer to the Democratic Party as the Democrat Party?,Democratic Party vs. Republican Party,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"From conservatives, particular Republicans, it’s meant as an anti-Democratic partisan epithet. (That said, non-anti-Democrats who use it in a neutral manner do so either because they don’t realize it’s incorrect or because shortening party names is historically common: the Federalist Party was occasionally called the Federal Party in colloquial settings, or how the Republican Party is called the G.O.P.)This isn’t new, partisan epithets are as old as the nation itself. Loyalists to the British monarchy in the Thirteen Colonies were called Tories while American revolutionaries, particularly in the northern colonies, were called Yankees.The Democratic Party actually got it’s name from an epithet. Originally, and ironically, called the Republican Party, the Party’s initial opponents, the aforementioned Federalists, called the Republicans “Democrats” to associate them to the left-wing, liberal radicalism of the the French Revolution. The name was quickly adopted by opponents of the liberal, pro-French Republicans, but just as quickly appropriated by those same Republicans endearing them with the masses, namely workers, farmers, immigrants, and other out-groups as champions of the common man. For the next several decades Democrat would continue in use, more and more as a badge of honor and less so as an epithet. By the 1820s and 1830s, those who rallied around the Jacksonian cause added the Democratic descriptor to their Republican name to differentiate themselves from the neo-Federalist faction (since the actual Federalist Party was virtually extinct at the national level) within the Republican Party: the pro-Adams, pro-Clay National Republicans. The Republicans, now clearly embracing the Democratic label and calling themselves Democratic Republicans more openly than ever, would eventually fully embrace simply the name of the Democratic Party in 1844. The neo-Federalist Whig Party would try to add the label democratic to their party name, but with little meaningful success. It’s no surprise that Democrats maintained overall control of government national politics for six decades after Jefferson’s election while their opponents, Federalists, National Republicans, and Whigs have become bywords for failed political institutions, only living on indirectly through the modern Republican Party; don’t mind the irony in that too much.",42,0,10,238,0,0

This would create a scenario where government is rendered ineffective. The House would not pass any of Trump’s agenda. Trump would not sign any of the House’s legislation. So nothing would get done, and both parties would blame each other for the failure. Given no other options, the House would begin investigating Trump hardcore, making the Mueller investigation look like a friendly chat in comparison. Expect day after day of news reports of the latest congressional inquiry. Trump would rapidly start hating his job, because it wouldn’t be fun anymore, and he’d start lashing out at the House of Representatives in specific and Democrats in general. His base would eat his tweets like manna from heaven, and everyone looking for adults in government would be seriously disappointed for the next 2 years.

To go so far as to get 53 seats, they’d have to defend all their seats (!) and win the Likely Republican seat in Texas. To get above 53 seats, they’d have to win one of the Safely Republican seats. It’s not unexpected. A solidly safe seat in Alabama was won by a Democrat, of course. However, the absolute best the Democrats could do in this election, in the utterly unprecedented case of winning every open seat, is 60 votes in the Senate.60 votes isn’t bad, mind you. It’s a Filibuster proof majority. But it’s not a Veto-Proof majority. That has several implications.There will be no legislation passed that Trump doesn’t want. If Trump plays the same game he’s been playing so far, Democrats = Bad, so anything the Democratic House and Senate passed would be Bad, and Trump would Veto it, and short of 6 Republicans joining this unlikely 60 vote caucus, nothing will get passed. Period. See the blame game with the House.Impeachment is off the table. Dems would need 6 more votes from the Republican side of the aisle to get rid of Trump before 2020.The 60th vote (no, let’s be serious, the 53rd vote) would come from states in which Republican senators represented the state as little as 2 years ago. We’ll have more Cornhusker Kickbacks and Louisiana Purchases (see: Nelson and Landrieu’s votes on the ACA), and more watered down legislation by the Democrats, just to get past the Filibuster. These would do exactly what they did in 2010 — demoralize Democrats and motivate Republicans. These wins will come at the expense of 2020. (Democrats are stupid here. 2020 is super-important, given redistricting. They should be playing the long game, and should have been playing it since 2012. I wonder, however, what is their 5 year plan, let alone their 10 and 20 year plan.)There are some advantages here to even winning 51 seats. Democrats would be able to stop Trump from appointing any more far-right votes. A loss of one of the Liberal justices might be met with Democrats saying ‘either appoint one of our choices, or we hold it for after 2020.’ However, unless the vote for Kennedy’s seat can be delayed until after the elections (not likely, McConnell would simply hold lame duck sessions to appoint a Right-winger, as this has been THEIR 10 year plan since it became clear Bush was going to lose them 2008), the damage is already done on that regard. Also, Trump won’t get any more of his legislation through, but the damage done from not dealing with the People’s Business will be an albatross he’ll try to hang around the Dem’s neck (and the Dems around his neck).

The Democrats will hold hearings about anything and everything pertaining to Trump and/or Russia, while completely ignoring the numerous problems that actually face everyday Americans. That’s not progressive.The Democrats have made a conscious choice to ignore the issues in favor of just being “anti-Trump”. They don’t actually stand for anything because they don’t want to stand for anything. They just want your money and your votes, same as the Republicans.So what will happen if the Dems sweep the midterms? Nothing. Not a damn thing.

5,Is Tommy Robinson the British activist a troublemaker who was rightfully arrested?,Drudge Report (website),1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Thanks for the ask.On May 8, 2017 he attended a rape trial in Canterbury Crown Court. He attempted to record video footage inside the courtroom itself (which is expressly forbidden in all court cases in the UK under our Contempt of Court laws, as it is considered prejudicial in active trials). Having been removed from the courtroom and having had the rules explained regarding where someone can and cannot record video footage with respect to courts (as in, not in the courtroom, not in the courthouse, and not on the precincts of the courthouse itself - directly outside), he proceeded to record in the courthouse and on the precincts of the courthouse.He was arrested for this and sentenced to three months imprisonment, suspended for eighteen months. This meant that if he didn’t break the law for the next 18 months, the three month jail sentence would go away, but if he did, that sentence would be added to the subsequent sentence. In sentencing him, the judge said the following:“You should be under no illusions that if you commit any further offence of any kind, and that would include, I would have thought, a further contempt of court by similar actions, then that sentence of three months would be activated, and that would be on top of anything else that you were given by any other court.”In fairness, when Tommy Robinson turned up outside Leeds Crown Court on May 25, 2018, for the first hour of his recording he stayed outside the precincts of the courthouse. He then crossed the road to shake the hand of a prisoner about to go to jail and forgot to switch his cameraphone off. That landed him in contempt once again.Many rookie court reporters fall foul of this part of the Contempt of Court rules, by putting a sneaky toe too far forward and crossing into the precincts of the court in the process. And, like Tommy Robinson was given the first time, they are taken aside and warned where they can and cannot stand. If they do it again, they are arrested and typically given a suspended sentence and when they get back to their office, their editor will either fire them, remove them from court duty, or tear them a new one with such force they never get to the third strike.So, yes, Tommy Robinson was rightfully arrested. You are allowed a rookie error in this, but not three. If he wants to present himself as thrusting media champion in the future, he should read McNae’s Essential Law for Journalists and find out what he can and cannot do.If he waits for the next edition, he’ll probably be in it.On the other hand, if his excitement constantly gets the better of him outside a court (and for some journalists, that happens) he should either pursue another course of journalism, or another source of employment.

The sort of reporting which happens pre and during a trial in the USA is simply illegal here - factual reporting as to who said what during a trial is fine. The sort of talking-head speculation about witnessess, the life-history of the accused and such which happens in the USA is likely here to influence a jury and is contempt of court.On the plus side, this means that juries don’t have to be sequestered in the same way as juries are sequestered in the USA (look at what amounted to the months in prison which the OJ Simpson jurors had to endure to avoid seeing the media coverage). Sometimes when there’s linked trials, there are restrictions on reporting until the last one is complete, so that juries won’t learn that the Uncle referred to in one trial has aleady been found guilty / pleaded guilty of a similar offence in another trial.Once a trial is over, ther media are all over the details like seagulls on chips - rest assured that the British Public are given every detail revealed in court, full background on the accused, the full works. All reporters should know the rules, they’re clear and generally followed. Robinson was under a suspended sentence for trying to disrupt a trial by self-reporting on social media a highly biased and distorted view of events which could have led to a mistrial.He was given a very clear instruction by the judge that were he in the next 18 months to turn up to another trial and broadcast views about the guilt of those whose cases had not yet been determined by a jury then he would go to prison.

He wanted the cops to arrest him so that he could claim he was oppressed, and use that to embolden his supporters. Inciting a response and then complaining about it is a common tactic of the far-right, such as when racist groups bait anti-fascists into fights, like at Charlottesville.Arresting feeds into the far-right narrative of “Islamic takeover” and “leftist censorship”, and has already resulted in hundreds of far-right protesters gathering in Downing Street.[1]Robinson is, in my opinion, a very dangerous figure. This is, after all, a man who was briefly the vice-chairman of a neo-fascist political party.[2] He’s also given speeches where he claimed that “every single Muslim” bore responsibility for terrorism, and threatened violence against the Islamic community as a response.[3] Please see video in footnotes.But still, arresting him for his actions outside the recent trial was a bad move; it’s only going to embolden his supporters.A better move would be to simply ignore Robinson and his bigoted ramblings.Allah (subhanahu wa ta’ala) knows best.

Good economic news is good economic news, regardless of who’s in the Oval Office.If one is feeling partisan, it’s hardly that difficult to impute any good economic news to the aftereffects of the Obama administration anyway.

Will they ever re-group?,Democratic Party vs. Republican Party,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Democrats, right now, are a seething mass of outrage. When Trump won the election, there were a few weeks of shock and denial. The party fell into chaos after their historic failure in 2016. That was an election they should have won easily. Instead, they lost to Vladimir Putin and the guy from Celebrity Apprentice. It was a moment of shame for the entire country, but especially for the Democratic Party.Then there was the Women’s March.It was possibly the single biggest political march in US history. It was held the day after we swore in Trump, and easily dwarfed his fun-sized inauguration crowds.From that sprung hundreds of local groups. These groups descended on airports when Trump attempted to enact his racist and intolerant immigration policies. They descended on the offices of Congressional leaders to stop him from gutting the Affordable Care Act and stealing health coverage from millions.Democrats have won election after election in the aftermath of Trump. The Blue Wave is real. The party itself is still rudderless, but the voters are ready to grab their pitchforks and torches.As for the old Republican Party… it is shattered and demoralized. They sold their soul to a reality TV star in exchange for some doomed-to-be-short-lived tax breaks. I don’t know what they were thinking.Republicans with any principles are fleeing their own party. It’s going to take a generation for them to recover from what’s happened in the last 18 months alone. White Supremacists marching down American streets. A president that no sane person wants to work for, who lies — provably lies — to the American people more than four times per day. In 18 months we went from world power to international laughing stock. That’s all on Republicans.The Democratic Party is still in a time of transition. Trump exploded the political norms we’re used to and Hillary Clinton proved that the center-right days of the Democratic Party are over. 2018 will probably give Democrats back the house, but not the Senate. That year and 2019 will be the birth of the new left-leaning Democratic party, at least in my opinion.In 2020 there will be a Democratic Party rallied behind a leader that will likely reflect the anger the majority of Americans feel towards their government right now. Maybe it will be Joe Biden thundering away at Trump in debates, or maybe it will be a new, younger leader. Maybe we’ll nominate another woman and try to make history, once again.In 2021 Republicans will likely be out of power, completely. You’ll probably see regulations put in place to curtail the destructive power of another Trump-like leader. Maybe even some rules put in place for special elections if foreign interference can be determined to have corrupted the results of an election.After that you’re probably looking at total Democratic control until 2023. Maybe the GOP takes the house back per tradition that year, maybe not. Not if they’re still the party of Trump, that’s for sure. They’re going to have to go through their own transitional period, and find out what kind of party they want to be.

There are exceptions, especially in Arizona for some reason.I think the Senate and the House are separate issues and the Federal and State divide as well. Trump has few stout defenders in the old guard Republican Party. His booster squad is very much the Post Obama component of the GOP. The people who came in from 2010 onward. This is not true of the Senate where his support is grounded in the extremists but otherwise it is little more than nominal and only then because these guys are very cagey at politics.The challenge so far is that running as a “mini-Trump” keeps backfiring. Even non politicians who make a Trumpian gaffe get ground up while he still seems to have Teflon armor on.So how long can this last? If there is in fact a “blue wave” coming up, the Republicans will turn on him. If there is no Democratic Insurgency, then the GOP that has existed since Goldwater and Reagan reshaped the party will be very much dead. The TeaPublicans will have fully wrested control and excised any vestiges of moderation.The value of that outcome is purely a personal opinion but I will find it unfortunate. This new Republican Party has no ideology beyond, “things were better before”. They are ideologically inconsistent on everything else. They pick and choose when their positions apply (Govt should stay out of people’s healthcare, unless you are a woman, everyone should have a gun except around congress members). The ideal scenario is Debt. The Republicans always complain about debt but they operate the debt causing districts and the debt driving states. They rationalize that if they could just kick all the “takers” off the government teet we would be fine. What they fail to recognize is that they have more “takers” per capita than other places and that poses risk.The Democrats on the other hand were simply bought off. Their ideology is basically, everything should be fair, which is a myth, nothing is really fair. Their policy is no less procorporatist than the Republicans, it’s just devoid of the malevolent racism but keeps most of the institutional racism in place.We let money poison politics and we ended up with a bunch of whores. Trump promised to “drain the swamp” but really, he just imported more brazen whores with lower standards.Neither party will stabilize until we clean up campaign finance. Everyone is now being bought and sold by a monied interest that might not even be American anymore. State House campaigns get campaign contributions from the far side of the country and both Presidential Candidates last go around got money and/or support from outside the county.One day we might wake up and realize we are being ruled, not governed and unless you have a couple of million, disposable and discretionary, dollars you are unlikely to be in the new hereditary nobility of the Neo-American Empire, you will just be a resource to be exploited as needed.",203,5,275,"1,377",0,0

Especially if someone manages to get it released or leaked to the public.I suspect then that a monumental effort will be undertaken to keep it from being release, ever, and to have that established well before Mueller’s team finishes. Of course, that will prove hard to manage, first because no one knows how far away “finished” is, and second because it’s apparently not that easy to establish a legally defensible premise.Nixon tried his devious best. That just didn’t work, and his failure is a matter of official court records: “Precedence”…So, like with Nixon, the GOP congressmen won’t be afraid of what Washington might say, or the DOJ might dispute. They will be very nervous about what their own compatriots and voters might do, more than anything.Just like last time, Congress has been largely waiting for someone else to give them the overriding excuse to rid themselves of what they know is an unproductive, uncooperative and very unpopular obstacle, to the one thing they have come to value most: Their own longevity in office.They must already realize that Trump is a danger to that which keeps them in office, voter decisions. They can see the “blue wave” coming in this year’s elections, and wouldn’t it be ever-so comforting to eliminate the most divisive, chronic and politically dangerous aspect of their environment right now.They’re also smart enough to realize that they could so much more easily pursue their ongoing agenda (not Trump’s agenda), if they didn’t have Trump’s flaming firestorm of controversy to wade through every single day they try to do their jobs.Do you remember who was President after Nixon?“The presidency of Gerald Ford began on August 9, 1974, when Gerald Ford became President of the United States upon the resignation of Richard Nixon from office, and ended on January 20, 1977, a period of 895 days. Ford had served as Vice President of the United States since December 6, 1973, following Spiro Agnew's resignation from that office.”“Mr. Vanilla”…By comparison, to the present GOP congress members, even Pence would be such a great relief from the “Barnum and Trump Circus”, that once credible evidence would be in the public’s hands where they couldn’t deny it, they would consider it a “gift”, not a burden.

2,Did Trump’s administration do anything directly to help lower the black unemployment rate or are the numbers just a lucky side effect of the bull economy?,CNBC,Unemployment Rate,Fox News (cable news network),1!,1!,1!,"The US economy has been pretty consistently grown and unemployment has been pretty consistently falling for the last eight years. Why did the economy improve, then and now? If you can comprehensively and consistently answer that question, you'll be a good candidate to win the Nobel Prize.The fact is, the degree to which any president can impact the economy is a topic of much debate, even among professional economists, but it's pretty clear that there's only so much a president can do to move the needle in either direction, and changes tend to happen slowly. Whoever's president when the economy improves will, to a near certainty, try to take credit for it. Whether they had anything to do with it or not is an open question.In the case of the current economy, I'm 100% certain it isn't entirely Trump's doing. Does he have anything at all to do with it? That's hard to say. If you ask his supporters what he's done to drive it, they'll generally point to the tax bill, but that doesn't really seem to have changed the trajectory of jobs growth or economic performance in any clear way. They'll talk about him being generally business friendly and coal friendly, but the actual, concrete changes that he's made are so small that it's really reaching to claim they had any substantial economic impact. The biggest argument they can make is that his mere presence in office increased business confidence, which then stimulates growth (there was a clear bump up in the stock market right after the election, despite him being months away from even taking office. That may or may not have validity, but the effect is so wildly ambiguous that it's impossible to draw a straight line between that and how the economy is currently doing. It also raises a far more interesting question: if someone's mere presence (irrespective of anything they actually do) has an effect, should they get credit for simply being there? That's a philosophical point, but it's the kind of thing that we end up in when debating the intersection between economics and politics.What is true, and undeniable, is that the economy has continued its upward trajectory under Trump. Whether or not he had any impact on it, he hasn't derailed economic growth, which is a good thing. Whether or not he's driven that, or deserves credit for it, or should be returned to the White House for it are all much more complex questions, for which there is no objective answer.I will say this. If the economy goes sour over the next two years, I absolutely and completely guarantee that neither Trump nor his supporters will claim it's his fault. I mean, Trump is trying to blame Democrats for his policy of taking children of immigrants away from their parents, is he going to say ""my bad"" if the economy crashes? And Trump's opponents will all loudly declare that it's entirely his fault, and of course this was going to happen. Because neither side is looking for an objective determination about economic cause and effect. They're both looking to shore up their own talking points.The real question is whether you think the policies that Trump is pursuing are sound, appropriate and sustainable. And that goes for all his policies, not just economic. Saying that he's a good or bad president based on what the economy is doing today is almost as dumb as saying global warming isn't real because it's cold outside.",483,13,14k,"6,957",0,0

2,Did Trump’s administration do anything directly to help lower the black unemployment rate or are the numbers just a lucky side effect of the bull economy?,CNBC,Unemployment Rate,Fox News (cable news network),1!,1!,1!,"Yes, in fact he did.What Trump did was hold out hope to the economy.This is the thing all the various Democratic commentators, professional and otherwise, seem to fail to understand. The economy is less about monetary policy and taxes than it is about trust.Just to take out the passion out of this discussion, let’s deal in historical examples, namely France, England and the United States.France was always a much naturally wealthier country than England, with a larger land mass, greater population and a fair climate. It had a well-organized state, better organized in fact than their English cousins, yet England rivaled and surpassed France militarily for most of their common history for an interesting reason.England routinely collected a far greater proportion of its national output in the form of taxes, which allowed its state to out-spend France. Various political scientists, including the estimable Francis Fukuyama, attribute this to the trust average Britons had for their government, which had, for the time, a remarkable degree of political representation across all of its classes. State projects had a high degree of support from the population, whereas the French were (and still are) hiding their income from the tax man. The French institutionalization of corruption through the sale of venal offices (government functions sold as heritable property), changed the relationship between the governors and the governed, creating a mirror image of the high-trust relationship in Britain.To make this even clearer, consider that the American revolution, sparked by issues of taxation, occurred in a circumstance where Britons paid FIVE TIMES the taxes than did Americans.Tax revenues, as expressed as a percentage of GDP, are a pretty good indicator of how much trust citizens have for their governments. Weak governments in developing countries collect much less that strong governments (i.e. the Scandinavian countries, Germany). Germany in particular has a high tax rate, but delivers public goods with an efficiency and effectiveness comparable to the private sector. In other words, they provide clear value for a given tax Euro even as they respect the legal rights of their citizens.Americans have enormous respect for their democratic institutions, but little confidence in their government(s), which are seen as corrupt, incompetent, and manipulative. Democrats believed Obamacare would guarantee political dominance for several generations, but stubbornly ignored the fact that the only people who liked it where their political clients—supporters who are NOT presented with a bill. Judging from the 4 losing election cycles (soon to be five?), Obamacare was an albatross rather than a Pegasus.Second only to the “basket of deplorables” comment, perhaps nothing hurt Hillary Clinton, and the image of the Democratic Party more than her “unfortunate” response to West Virginia coal miners. She promised an ambiguous “green energy” future (the same future Obama had promised eight years prior…) even as she declared they would be losing their mining jobs in the present.For an allegedly smart lady, she sure said a lot of incredibly stupid things. This kind of comment, and similar ones by President Obama and other elite Democrats, did nothing to improve moral, and in fact the Democratic Party message seems to be that White People need to take their medicine and quit their whining.Maybe they do, but seriously, do you think elections can be won with this type of rhetoric? Do you think people can be convinced to invest time, energy and resources when this is the attitude of the governing elites?Economies do well when people feel their investments are secure. When they don’t feel secure, for whatever reason, they hold back. President Trump may say things people don’t like to hear, but he is doing the things they like to see, which is why consumer confidence is at an historical high and why black unemployment is at a low ebb.",234,10,514,"3,198",0,2

The change has been in people educating themselves. Government funded schools, grants, outreach, and loans have made it possible for people to help themselves.

The first is Thomas Sowell’s Conflict of Visions, where he says that the primary difference is built around the idea of the perfectibility of the individual human. Not perfectibility in the sense of being ultimately perfect: not only no, but hell no. But perfectible in the sense of being improvable, to be able to learn and grow, to be and become. And to learn to see things from a higher vantage point.Liberals say that people can continue to be coached up, and should be governed in such a way as to encourage the development of higher-quality humans. Conservatives—Sowell is one—tend to view human nature as immutable. What you see is what you get, and any “improvements” are illusory, or bear the high cost of unintended consequences.For a contrary point of view, check out Moral Politics, by George Lakoff, a liberal thinker. For Lakoff, the difference is one of Nurturing Parent vs. Strict Parent. Going way over the top here, and in pursuit of grins, Lakoff sees Nurturing Parents as those who nourish and shape and form, and who have a great deal of patience for miscreants who haven’t gotten the message yet. Strict Parents, on the other hand, are more likely to yell, “Of course you can’t have the damn car Saturday night. You missed taking the trash out last week and—dammit!— you just can’t be irresponsible like that and expect to skate by. Actions have consequences!”I’m a political moderate, by the way. A Democrat, but not as far left as you might think.And as you look at what I’ve written, hopefully you can see that my politically-moderate stance is at least partly informed by believing that both sides have valid points.

We believe the United States of America is unlike any other nation on earth. We believe America is exceptional because of our historic role — first as refuge, then as defender, and now as exemplar of liberty for the world to see.”The 2016 Democratic Platform begins with more specifics about what the government should do for its citizens but eventually gets to who we are or should be on a world scale and I quote:“Democrats believe we are stronger and safer when America brings the world together and leads with principle and purpose. We believe we should strengthen our alliances, not weaken them. We believe in the power of development and diplomacy. We believe our military should be the best-trained, best-equipped fighting force in the world, and that we must do everything we can to honor and support our veterans. And we know that only the United States can mobilize common action on a truly global scale, to take on the challenges that transcend borders, from international terrorism to climate change to health pandemics.”As an American whose main objective for our country is to stop war and start peace, I find both platforms objectionable.It’s hard to think of a more isolating, insulting, false, and dangerous attitude than the Republicans express, and the Democratic position puts war as a central theme and obligation in the false guise of supporting peace.It is our government that supports and wages our wars. The people of both parties are propagandized into believing it is our duty and our right to dictate to the world but many are tired of our endless wars.

We elect politicians, again, in theory, to represent our interests in whatever position they occupy.So, it would be logical and reasonable for us to expect that the principles of the politicians we elect to represent us, would require them to act in our best interests. But with a very few notable exceptions, this is rarely what actually happens. Since US politicians have become so reliant on the financial support of the corporate/wealthy class it is their interests and agenda that is actually being promoted by the politician, not the interests of the voters who elected them.So, when a US politician extols his “resume” of “beliefs”, religion, conservatism, or liberalism, he is just pandering for the votes of the public that he needs to get elected. Those “values” or principles are most usually nothing more than an attempt to convince a voter that the politician will represent his interests, but since the interests and agenda of a small percentage of the corporate/wealthy class are really foremost in importance to the politician, the pandering to the voter is a lie.Bottom line answer therefore, is “no”. None of the politicians from either establishment party have coherent principles underlying their political positions. Their commitments and actions are entirely the result of bribery by the corporations and the wealthy who funded their campaigns. If you wish to be elected to high office in the United States, and you are affiliated with an establishment party, it is a given that you have disavowed any semblance of “principle” on any political position, in favor of carrying out the agenda of the “interests” that financed your campaign.

Americans take a stance and set up battle lines. They cherry pick data and root in rarely trying to find common ground, there is an inherent distrust to ‘the other side’.Usually the debate is also filled with misinformation that is being touted as the Gospel truth or slight of hand manipulation or argumentative fallacies to prove a point… poorly.Now hop on over to Ireland…My first time in Ireland was when Ireland was voting on the first Lisbon referendum which, as an American, I had no idea about.I hopped in a cab and while speaking to the cabby he chose to ask my stance on the matter, to which I said I was clueless.For about the next 20 minutes I got a breakdown of the pros and cons of Ireland ratifying the treaty, how the cabby felt about the matter and the long term impact he saw on Ireland and it’s culture as well as the long term future of the EU.Here is the thing though, he expressed his rationalization and the counter points in a mature manner and even recognized his concerns of losing his culture as a fear he needed to balance. It was a rational argument he was having in his conversation.Now this would be fine and well but carry this over to my time in Scotland when I got to listen into and even participate in discussions about Brexit.These debates shared much in common with American debates, battlelines were drawn.What was different though was the battlelines were only against the position and not the individual.Likewise, people seemed more willing to listen to the other side far more and even conclude they wanted what was best for Scotland.The other side was not the enemy and there was a rationalization that played out in arguments, some issues with argumentative fallacies but those weren’t purposefully inserted to derail the conversation.Now this isn’t politicians debating, just average people.But in the UK and Ireland in my experience the debates tend to be far less toxic between people.There is a recognition of opposing views as opposed to opposing people.A better dialogue emerges from this form of debate, there is less fear of being wrong.To me, the debates felt more like working to a goal to achieve a better nation, not to subvert the other side.",225,2,140,"2,333",0,0

Much to the contrary, for the early part of the 20th Century, West Virginia was solidly in the Republican camp.However, by being a splinter from Virginia, it still shared many of the same demographics that were traditionally sympathetic to the Democratic Party of the day; and so it was one of the few Union states that regularly elected Democrats both locally and to Congress in the wake of the Civil War.It was, however, more of a swing state than part of any solid bloc heading into the 20th Century. West Virginia’s transition into becoming a mostly Democratic state occurred during the Great Depression when the Democratic Party, led by Franklin Roosevelt, was ascendant.Related reading: Carter Moore's answer to How did the Democrats control the House for 40 years (1954–1994), even when Republicans won presidential elections by landslides?By the time Robert Byrd started his career in politics, the Democratic Party was the state’s dominant party, with West Virginia’s legislature, governor, Senators, and Representatives all in the Democrats’ camp.The Democratic Party’s strength in West Virginia held pretty roundly through the rest of the 20th Century - with deviations here and there - and into the 21st.However, starting in the 1980s, the Republican Party began to make significant inroads with white, rural, working class American voters; and as national politics began supplanting local politics, the Democratic strength in West Virginia started to ebb accordingly with demographics. This was manifested in 2004, when West Virginia voted to re-elect Bush/Cheney, having voted for Bush in 2000. It was the first time since 1928 that West Virginia had consecutively backed the Republican presidential ticket, and despite the fact that Democrats were still otherwise in control of all other aspects of West Virginian politics.But West Virginia’s demographic shift towards the Republican Party along with most rural, white voters was pushed along by the steady erosion of West Virginia’s primary industry - mining, and coal more specifically[1] - which Republicans blamed on Democrats in their pursuit of environmentally friendly policies.And while locally elected Democrats - like Robert Byrd - were often outspoken in their defense of West Virginia’s mining industry, often at odds with the national party, and managed to survive reelection challenges, there was too little action to show for their promises.Cut to now, and Democrats are on the outs in West Virginia.But going back to Robert Byrd specifically: Again, by virtue of being a Democrat, he was pretty well assured of electoral success. As his incumbency became more entrenched, he became more immune from serious political challenges.However, perhaps his best saving grace was his chairmanship of the Senate Committee on Appropriations from 1989 to 1995. He used that position to funnel billions of dollars into West Virginia, and his electorate dutifully rewarded him for the effort. But even when not holding the gavel, Byrd was immensely successful at steering projects into West Virginia, which greatly improved his political currency and allowed him to stay in the Senate to the end.Related reading: Political party strength in West Virginia (Wikipedia)Footnotes[1] In West Virginia, Coal Means More, Party Less",573,23,5.7k,"3,124",0,3

The result — both Obama and his successor have had problems making their respective policies into laws as their congresses haven’t been especially cooperative. So both have resorted to executive orders, that can be easily overturned by their successors. The camaraderie and respect that each division of government should have for one another was lacking for Obama and now for Trump, thus forcing the respective presidents to rule by fiat. Obama used the executive order for the Iran agreement, trade agreements, climate change, EPA, housing rules, etc. And whether or not one agrees with these executive orders, they are being overturned by President Trump’s executive orders. A major policy that became law was President Obama’s health program — and that, for the most part, remains intact.

But that's not possible until 2020.Things accomplished through bills/laws would be harder. For example, the shockingly regressive tax cuts that squeaked by at the end of 2017, would be hard to undo unless Democrats control both houses and the presidency. Fortunately, the infighting, incompetent Republican Congress hasn't been able to actually DO much of anything, so the ledger here is much smaller than it could have been.Re the courts, the best case scenario is Democrats taking control of the Senate in 2018, at which point they can refuse to confirm any Trump judicial appointments.",152,4,2,37,0,0

There is nothing stopping other parties from building such coalitions. Few people understand what is meant by coalition building before an election, or why it is inevitable, or why it is necessary for victory or how it is done… so to those people, it looks like some “system” because they are unable to fathom the actual nature of the cause and effect.

Sometimes the coalitions struggle to form a government and you get gridlock.On the other hand if a coalition gets a majority they can rule without having to worry about the party in the minority blocking agendas.For example in 1980, when president Reagan won, he carried the Senate, but had a House that obstructed as much of his agenda as possible. Obama after 2010 chose not to work with the House and instead issued a lot of executive orders, which have now been mostly over turned.In summation, overall the two party system works for us, if there was a change I would make, it would be to have the Congressional seats be tied in with the presidential vote, which would give a Congressional majority to the president.",35,0,10,200,0,0

His mantra seems to be, “Down with Democrats.”He admits his wrongdoing. He agrees that he did in fact give people money to make contributions to a political candidate and pretend it was really from them. And he further agrees that he knew it was against the law when he did it.It wasn’t really that much money, and only two other people were involved. He argues that it is commonly done, and literally never prosecuted, so the only sensible reason why he was prosecuted was because of a vendetta by the Obama White House.If indeed D’Souza’s right, that it happens all the time on a far greater scale than his felony, and when these crimes come to the attention of authorities, they uniformly fail to prosecute, then I see his point. The judge sentencing him was given that argument and rejected it, though.So what was the immoral justification for the pardon? Or at least the unethical reason for it.This is just another example of Trump signaling that he will take care of his own. That he’s not afraid to pardon, and that he won’t necessarily wait until the end of his presidency to do it.D’Souza has made movies and written books. He’s a Christian apologist.

He did it for two reasons. The first reason is that Trump wished to demonstrate that in this country, he will decide who is guilty or innocent, and that he and his supporters are above the law. It’s a slap at law enforcement and the independent judiciary. The second reason is to send a message to Michael Cohen, who faces similar charges as D’Souza and who knows where all of Trumps skeletons are buried. He wants Cohen to know that he, Trump, is capable and quite willing to obstruct justice and abuse his power to assure his criminal cohort that if he, Cohen, will take the fall and cover for Trump, Trump will void rule of law in America and get him off the hook if he’s convicted. Spoiler alert: Cohen is guilty as sin based solely on what is already publicly known about the case.Here’s why Trump’s ploy won’t work: Special Prosecutor Mueller is following a strategy whereby he refers state crimes discovered in prosecution of federal crimes to the State of New York, in whose business Trump may not interfere. If Trump succeeds in getting his henchman off the federal hook, there will be a whole raft of state charges awaiting Cohen. Cohen is aware of this, and he may cooperate in the case against Trump.

This is like calling Trump a “dumb prick” except that referring to female bits by a vulgar name seems worse to us than referring to male bits that way. Oh, except that it’s okay for our President to have referred to women’s pussies, in the context of saying that he feels entitled to grab them even when they belong to women he doesn’t know who haven’t given him permission to do so. Funny how the easily-offended just look right over that one, and all the other egregiously ugly things he has said, but never apologized for.Some people, particularly Americans, see the word cunt as demeaning to women, reducing them to their sexual parts. Other people in other countries use the word cunt as a general insult and fling it about at anyone and everyone.Given Bee’s gender and her obvious position on women’s equality and rights, I think she used it in a more general sense, as just a really low insult, though no one knows except Bee and I am not sure she’ll be discussing it in detail.Barr compared Valerie Jarrett to an ape. For those of you who wonder what the big deal is, it is a classic racist trope that black people are a lower species than white people, basically just apes who learned to talk.

There’s a history here, of Ivanka publishing a book about strong women, many of whom made public statements distancing themselves from her. The policies of Ivanka’s businesses also belie her so-called family values. She is so out of touch with reality that she went off to talk to Planned Parenthood on a ‘compromise,’ got schooled, and came home with egg on her face.There’s also the creepy history, which wouldn’t exist except for Donald starting and continuing it, of his personally-confessed attraction to Ivanka. It’s one of the reasons she — with zero qualifications — ended up in his administration. She is apparently able to get his attention for up to 15 minutes. Bee wasn’t suggesting that Ivanka have sex with Donald. She was suggesting that Ivanka use his self-confessed attraction to her to get his attention long enough to influence him to stop having babies and children torn out of their mothers’ arms.I might not have used the same word, but I agree with Bee: Ivanka, STFU about caring about women and children until you get a clue.Police called as Sen.

When I evaluate someone’s behavior, I evaluate it independently of the other side. I don’t care how many sexist things that a republican might say when I’m evaluating the sexism of a democrat. Two wrongs do not make a right and I have remarkably little patience for ‘whataboutism’. Liberals consistently claim they have an issue with it as well but only seem to take issue when it’s the republicans who are engaging in it.Quite recently I got into a discussion with a man who claimed to be a liberal. He was making excuses for various examples of liberals being sexist, mainly by finger-pointing to the republicans, complaining about Donald Trump and going on about how he can’t see why republicans would think they have any room to discuss the issue.As a centrist who did not vote for Donald Trump (and also a woman if that makes any difference) I pointed out to him that sexism is unacceptable no matter what side it is coming from and he doesn’t get to be the sole decision maker on whether or not a sexist comment is harmful to women.His response? He made a ‘joke’ in which he responded “Sssssh, the men are talking”He then asked if that is how a conservative would normally respond and added that he is generally used to being respectful of other people during discussions so “this whole being a sexist thing” was new to him.I had already made it clear to him that I am not a republican so I don’t know what value he thought it added to ‘pretend’ to talk to me like a conservative but needless to say this “respectful” liberal who is used to treating women with respect had quite the odd sense of humor.I wrote about it here: It’s Not Sexist if the Democrats Do It by Lauren Campbell on The Synergism School of EqualityHere is an excerpt from my post:I have seen democrats get on republicans about this type of finger-pointing numerous times. They claim that whenever republicans are shown things that their party has done wrong, they immediately start going “well what about Hillary!” when it’s irrelevant to the discussion at hand.Now if you will please peruse the answers on this page you will notice a plethora of democrats doing exactly this, finger-pointing to republicans to deflect attention from Samantha Bee.Hypocrites.There may be a cultural difference as well. In many other countries the “c word” is used casually, to refer to friends and make jokes and is rather inoffensive. It’s kind of the the same way the word ‘bitch’ is oftentimes used here in the US. It’s far removed from its original meaning, it is used to refer to both men and women and it isn’t much of an insult anymore.In the US on the other hand, people can live their entire lives without having the amount of hatred necessary for someone to hurl the “c word” at them. It is pretty much the last slur outside of the “n word” that still contains enough venom that many people can go their whole lives without wielding it against someone else.Unlike other slang terms such as ‘bitch’ it also hasn’t lost much of its gendered meaning. It’s not used for men and women fairly interchangeably, it is still used to specifically degrade women.Using the word has less to do with its meaning and more of the expression of intent behind it. It is an intention to hurt, an intention to degrade. Using it says “this is the worst thing I can say to hurt you” and that is why it is particularly shocking to Americans when it is used as a genuine insult.Because it is so rarely used, invoking it demonstrates the full amount of contempt behind it.That however was not the most offensive part of what Samantha Bee said in my opinion. What we have repeatedly observed is that Donald Trump has behaved in strange ways towards his daughter Ivanka. While no reasonable person could use it to claim that he has surely sexually abused her there is an uncomfortable dynamic in the way he treats her. To make a joke about the situation, to act like sexual abuse is funny, or something that can be trivialized, is in my opinion, terrible.Sexually abusing one’s daughter is not funny, it’s not a laughing matter and Samantha Bee goes the extra mile of making it out like Ivanka is a willing participant in this, that she is to be held responsible for her father’s feelings, that she’s a tease who uses her sexuality to manipulate him.It is disgusting in my opinion.Here is the full quote:""You know, Ivanka, that's a beautiful photo of you and your child, but let me just say, one mother to another, do something about your dad's immigration practices, you feckless c***!""""He listens to you,"" she added. ""Put on something tight and low-cut and tell your father to f***ing stop it. Tell him it was an Obama thing and see how it goes, OK?""Imagine if a conservative had said something like that about a liberal woman. There would have been outrage all around. But because it was directed at Ivanka Trump it was fine.I grow tired of the expectations liberals have that Ivanka should simply denounce or disown her own father, or somehow force him to agree with her own politics or convince him to go back on promises he made to his own constituents. I wrote about the subject here: Lauren Campbell's answer to How can Ivanka Trump call her dad a ‘feminist’?What did Ivanka do that inspired so much venom?Ivanka Trump’s 'Tone Deaf’ Photo With Son Sparks Backlash Over Border SeparationsShe posted a picture on social media of her and her child. That’s it. People started claiming that this was ‘tone deaf’ because of recent discussions of immigrant families being separated at the border. To me, it looks like she had some professional photography done and shared it. I don’t know anyone who would consider posting a family photo ‘tone deaf’ but boy apparently she deserves to be called derogatory names now and be instructed to go and commit incest with her father.It’s just despicable, it’s grasping at straws to express hate and rage towards anyone close to Donald Trump. Ivanka has done nothing wrong, she does not agree with his politics, she has used her business to do good, she joined his campaign and speaks of being very honest with her father about her views. People are simply blaming her for not being able to change her father’s mind on everything they don’t agree with him on and it has inspired vicious attacks towards her. I’m sick of it.Does Samantha deserve to be fired? I wouldn’t weep if she was. Some of her sponsors have pulled support from her show and I think that should be message enough.What I am more sick of is the constant hypocrisy and sexism from the left, which they refuse to acknowledge and constantly make up excuses for.",20.1k,847,4.9k,"4,716",1,1

From this perspective, Bee indeed shouldn’t have said that disgraceful word. But as we can see, she has apologized for it publicly.But if Bee was not cursing the first daughter, instead a “nobody,” will this incident turn into an “international hot topic?” Possibly not. Not many people would notice it, and it would never be an issue of the White House, and Bee has her “freedom of speech” in her future shows.So, from this angel, can we say, even in the States, where some people claim “freedom is above all the other rights,” there are still boundaries for “freedom of speech,” and “freedom of speech” itself can be double-standard?And as to whether Bee should be fired, I don’t think so. No one can guarantee that he/she would never make any mistakes in his/her whole life. Mistakes or errors should not be obstacles of growing, instead, they are lessons for self-improving.A hypothesis: If a Bee like Chinese TV host got fired because she cursed Chinese President Xi Jinping’s daughter Xi Mingze in her TV show, how would the Western medias report this? “Famous TV host persecuted for cursing Chinese first daughter” “Xi punished famous TV host severely to protect his daughter” “Xi tightens control on media after daughter cursed” “Human rights again violated in China by banning TV host” ......That’s for sure something we can expect.So, next time, when all those Western fighters and those Western medias slam over China’s lack of “freedom”, China’s censorship......blabla.....Keep this Ivanka-Bee case in your mind.There is no absolute “freedom” in the world.

Non-political studies of kindergarteners’ personalities match surprisingly well with political studies of the same people once they’ve reached voting age. We tend to say that “liberals are like this…” and “conservatives are like that …” but what we really see are missing words: there are personality types that tend to become liberal or conservative: how humans relate to authority, risk and change seems to come in a big pattern that overlays our politics.There are also things we think of as conservative values, appreciating past traditions, attempting to hold the nation together against pressures that would splinter it, being willing to serve (especially in the armed forces) if called on, integrity, working hard and taking responsibility for your failures … until recently, being rooted in family, church or community instead of materialism.I would split my answer:Today’s Republican Party is still composed predominately of people with the psychological characteristics we label conservative. A bit more stoic (to use a positive term) or rigid (to use a negative); a bit more fearful, or cautious, or aware of and prepared to deal with threats (to choose inherently-biased terms to label more objective research); more concerned about in-groups and purity and traditional taboos (eg immigration, same sex marriage, etc.)I do, strongly, believe that there is such a thing as useful conservative values even if I’m more the liberal psychological type — and America desperately needs those values. When people imagine a small town where people look out for their neighbors, work hard to build businesses that can hire others and would never cheat, serve in the military, on juries and wherever they are needed, balance their budgets. But today’s Republican Party, on the national stage, has very few of “conservative values” in the positive sense. Anyone who didn’t stand up against, for just one example, Birtherism, and draw a very public line in the sand there, is not a conservative with integrity. The same with veterans being thrown out of the US over immigrant status, or the pattern since Reagan of Republicans accelerating the deficit.America probably will have a cognitively-conservative party, because homo sapiens do seem to split this way, so those votes are out there.

1,Why are Democrats pro-choice?,Pro-Life Movement,Pro-Choice (Stance on Abortion),Abortion,1!,1!,1!,"Hm, where to start? I can think of several reasons, and will expand on them (although I don't know which of them, if any, is the most predominant), starting with the simple fact that arch-enemies Christian Conservatives hold the opposite view, and that's a reason. Then, there's how it all started: Liberals/the Left were first to embrace the ""free love"" ethic of the 1960's and 70's, which naturally led to more sex among young unmarrieds, which naturally led to more pregnancies, which naturally led to more demand for abortion, which naturally led to the Left making it a political cause, formulating reasoning for its legalization up to and including the notion that it was a constitutional right. There's also the aspect that the Left has, in general, always been the first to push back against societal norms, not the least of which was the long-standing custom and tendency of people reaching adulthood to seek a mate, get married, and begin having a family. During the 60's and 70's there arose the Feminists, who began bad-mouthing all marriage as ""slavery"" and ""servitude"" of women, giving rise to the stereotyped ""male chauvinist"". who ruled the roost as not just the husband but the boss of the family, subjugating his wife to his will, and condemning her to bear children as her duty, since women were best kept ""barefoot and pregnant and in the kitchen,"" as this two-dimensional male tyrant supposedly believed. Amidst this provoking idea of women in bondage, a/k/a married, to their disadvantage, what greater symbol of bondage could there be than to be implanted (by the boss!) with a seed that would inevitably grow, stretching its hapless bearer's belly more and more, until it entered this world to immediately assume the role of another stone around the neck of the doomed woman, another symbol of her submission, the submersion of her own wishes and will, in deference to others whose needs were put ahead of her own. What was once thought virtuous began to be considered old-fashioned, even backward. Around the same time as abortion legalization was happening, so too was the the Pill, which then kicked off the first widespread use of contraceptives by not only grown women but young teenage females who were growing up in the era of free love, of people throwing off the chains of responsibility, demanding they not be shackled to either convention, societal demands, family, or definitely not something planted inside them which promised to keep growing whether they liked it or not. It was not long before the rate of teenage pregnancy began a long and sustained climb, despite the Pill, because teenagers often act first and think second and all it took was a couple of forgotten doses before the young lady might have a bigger problem on her hands than either she or her parents were prepared to deal with, especially in light of the availability of a remedy which, if only made legal, would render the problem non-existent, literally. Thus the Left for several reasons found itself in the midst of the argument for legalized abortion, and it picked its side, and it won. Then somebody had the idea to use the term ""pro-choice"" instead of ""pro-abortion"" because it just sounded better; it even sounded high-minded. The Left, despite its penchant for tearing down tradition and mocking even the loving and wholesome Cleaver Family, staple of 70's TV viewers, has always believed that it holds the higher moral ground in any issue, and abortion has through their years of effort acquired a sort of justified respectability as the ultimate expression of Woman's Liberation, the goal of the Feminists. It was the first time in modern history that women spoke of their ""right to do as they wish with their own bodies,"" as opposed to their previous idea that once they knew they were pregnant they became the caretakers, the nurturers, the baby whisperers, whose household magic transformed woman, man and children into a thing called a family, highly valued in those days. Thus, a pregnancy became a ""choice,"" taking moral consideration out of the equation on the grounds that a woman had no actual obligation to bear children, because she was no longer obligated in any way at all. She was a free spirit who did not have to be tied down against her will, and choices were hers and everywhere. Forty or so years after the so-called Summer of Love (1969), one might find it an interesting study to try and discover whether the Liberation of Women, through sex, divorce, the Pill, abortion, etc. had brought women happiness, or satisfaction. But that's a choice for another time.",24,0,4,109,0,0

I’ll never forget my mom and aunt sitting at the kitchen table telling me about how a man could force a woman into marriage by raping her. The fear of being an unwed mother back then was a very real thing. So while they didn’t believe in abortions they did believe it was a woman’s choice. The supported me when I had 2. The first one was the product of an abusive marriage and I didn’t want the man to have any control over me. The second one was financial. I was working 2 jobs, going to school and had a toddler.

2,What are the ideals of Republicans and Democrats nowadays?,Democratic Party vs. Republican Party,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Republicans trend Authoritarian and Comservative, while Democrats trend less Authoritarian and moderately Conservative. On the political scale, there are two factors: Social issues, and Economics. Authoritarian extremes include Stalin, Mussolini, Hitler or the “Iron Curtain”—with Libertarianism being the polar opposite, or “absolute freedom without authority”. On the economic scale, Socialism is on the true-left and Conservatism is at the true-right. American and western politics operate almost exclusively in the Authoritarian Right.RepublicansThe GOP is on the Authoritarian Right. Trump, for example, believes strongly that the public should obey his government and his decisions. His views on his government’s authority are outside of the norm of American politics, and is at the extreme on social issues—but fiscally, his views aren’t unusual.Social issues trend very Authoritarian, where the government can or should intervene to enforce a level of morality to be obeyed.Whereas fiscally conservative ideology favors independence, the Republican Party prefers the government being an authority on behavior and community, or issues effecting only some of our population. There are policies strongly supported that are religious or ethnic in origin, that favor their party’s demographic over others.Republicans are typically against federal laws that require safety, environmental or health regulations that could cost businesses or individuals money or hassle.The current GOP has become more Nationalist, favoring isolation over alliance with other nations globally. There is a defensive, self-centric ideology on foreign policy and immigration.Drugs are seen as an epidemic that should be stopped by enforcing harsher punishments and stronger laws that put drug addicts in prison and deter drug use by fear of consequence. Punishment typically takes priority over rehabilitation, and mandatory minimum sentences are favored as deterants. For-profit private prisons are supported as our public prisons are overpopulated.Republicans are top-down on economics. Conservative economics revolve around the belief that greed is good; that greed can be made useful. Top-down economics, or “trickle down”, subscribed to the belief that if big businesses and the wealthy are thriving, there will be plenty of jobs for everyone else.This economic ideology prefers an individual approach, where there are few government services and less collective contribution (like taxes). Tax cuts and benefits are slanted toward the super-rich and the wealthy, with the average American asked to contribute more.Public services like schools, national parks and environmental protection, NASA, and civil services like work programs or crisis safety nets like welfare or food stamps are generally seen as burdens that weigh down successful Americans.This is a “sink or swim” ideology, where the weak (or lazy) have the fear of failure or devastation to drive productivity, often accompanying the belief that the poor are so of their own making and must try harder—else they weigh down everyone else.Republicans typically are against regulation of big business and for-profit industry. Where for-profit industries are always seeking to make bigger margins, regulations that would attempt to help disadvantaged Americans are typically discouraged as dragging down business and profit.DemocratsDemocrats are toward the true meridian, moderately fiscally conservative and less Authoritarian on social issues. Occasionally, although rare, an American politician will land outside of Western norms. Bernie Sanders, for instance, trends toward fiscal socialism. He is near the true equator between Authoritarian and Libertarian, but it’s on the “far-left” of American norms on economics.Democrats strongly support equality in the eyes of the law, and staunchly support the separation of church and state.The Democrats social ideologies focus on liberty and freedom as one people—working toward equality between women and men, all races and religions, and against having a government that dictates morality.Democrats typically do support federal laws enforcing quality of life for the people, ranging from public safety to environmental protection.This ideology tends to rely on alliances and diplomacy on foreign policy. Sanctions and economics are used to apply pressure, with joint military actions preferred with allied nations (like NATO) and close cooperation with the UN.Democrats trend to favor rehabilitation over punishment for non-violent crime, and lighter sentencing. With a large percentage of our population in prisons for non-violent crime, Democrats are typically against for-profit prisons and excessive punishment for trivial infractions.Drugs are seen as an epidemic that requires a collective effort toward more education, more drug programs and better resources for rehabilitation and resolution.Democrats are bottom-up on economics, or middle-out, depending on the economic plan. Most Democrats are at least partially influenced by Keynesian economics. This approach focuses on the common American, generally most of us. The people’s party, that gave us unions and historically fights for wages and rallies for workers. Democrats subscribe to the idea that when American workers are doing well, bills are paid, credit is good, and the economy is fueled as common Americans are able to thrive, pay and spend.This economic ideology focuses on the middle class and working class, applying tax cuts and economic policies that help the average American. Taxes are slanted toward the super-rich and the wealthy, with most benefits going to common Americans.Democrats typically favor more public services, like National Parks, NASA, our public schools, environmental services, healthcare, and civil services like job training, welfare and food stamps.This ideology favors working together as a collective group. Taxes from the most wealthy are used to pull the least successful up and provide services like job training and education.Most recently, Democrats have made efforts toward public healthcare. The concept being that a cheap public healthcare plan can eliminate the billions of dollars of unpaid emergency room and medical costs the poor are unable to pay, thus lowering the cost of healthcare for everyone.Democrats typically favor oversight and regulation of big business. Where it affects people and our citizens, Democrats tend to want at least some regulation that prevents our for-profit system from exploiting the disadvantaged to a point where it’s impossible for the working class or poor to get ahead.In summary, Republicans are seen as the party of business and de-regulation. Democrats are the people’s party, for public services and wages. On social issues, Republicans trend more Authoritarian, with laws and policies the public should obey. Democrats trend toward a government that works for the people. In a healthy democracy, we would alternate between these approaches regularly—sometimes focusing on industry and business, and then subsequently focusing on workers and people. Democracy suffers when we follow one of these approaches for too long, neglecting the other.",760,4,42,225,1,0

Republicans will rail against “the elite” while ignoring the fact that their policies are first and foremost designed to transfer more and more of the wealth of this country into the pockets of their already-wealthy supporters, who are, by any definition, “elite”.Democrats, on the other hand, actually acknowledge the fact that the vast majority of the people in this country are not wealthy, and therefore do not benefit in any way from most of the laws and regulations passed by Republicans.

Small states are over-represented in the US Senate. More of the small states are red than blue. In the House of Representatives Democrats have to get 53% of the national vote in order to have a majority. Democratic voters are concentrated in big cities, so if you draw lines without regard to politics, you will probably end up with Democrats being under-represented. Of course, the party in power in the legislature tries to skew the districts in their favor. This is most often the Republicans. The electoral college favors small states because states get an elector for every representative, and an elector for each senator. In 2000 Gore got a majority of the popular vote, but only won 20 states. That meant 40 extra electoral votes for his opponent, votes awarded because of the placement of state lines over 100 years ago, not because the people expressed a preference for Bush. The Supreme Court is turning more conservative because presidents and senators who don’t represent the will of the majority choose the justices.(2) Voting based on emotion and culture, rather than economic reality.

4,It seems that the most popular political stance is liberal. From where then do Republicans gain the power?,U.S. Republicans,Elections in the United States of America,1!,1!,1!,1!,"I can speak to this, I was a liberal as a young man, a conservative most of my adult life, and left both sides entirely in 2016 to just watch and learn about human nature. I am an avid watcher of human beings and dissecting what's ""really going on in there"" and I think politics exposes A LOT of deeper insights into human nature. I am deeply, deeply well-read on political movements of the 20th century to the point I've researched primafacie documents right down to things like the actual NDSAP (Nazi Party) platform of Munich 1920, I do not have a degree in this area, however I have read more on this topic than I ever read in what my degree is in. I would describe my politics as neo-liberal, anti alt-right, anti alt-left, no party affiliation. That's my bias.Well, let's get this straight: most people who label themselves ""liberal"" in 2018 are leftist, NOT liberal. The modern left shares almost nothing with the liberal ideological pedigree. Because of this I think older, wiser, more knowledgeable generations understand the dangers of leftism and don't necessarily vote FOR Republicans, they vote against leftism. Because academia is so wildly left leaning it has exponged all of the damning evidence of the fascisms and totalitarian regimes of the 20th century being rooted mostly in leftism, and yes that DOES include the Nazi's, a socialist workers movement, rooted in activating youth activism, anti-Capitalist, huge proponents of a public education emphasis, nationalized health care, class warfare, obsessed with pointing out unfairness, strict gun control… and so on… it was eerily similar to this generation who values ""activism"" over ""acting better"". Those of us who are deeply knowledgeable and well-read on the topic know there is a danger from the alt-right but it is dwarfed by a very real and present danger from the left because most of the modern left IS alt-left and they can't even see it. From their very root axioms they are definitionally Neo-Social-Marxist, and the fact they are blind to it is very dangerous.I also think that to call ones self ""liberal"" carries some air of ""see, I'm morally superior to you"" and you don't even have to be a better person. It's the easiest path of least resistance, you don't even have to think, you just repeat cliche's and move along ""feeling better"" about yourself with no effort to be an actual better person. After all, your professors will give you better grades, beautiful rich actors and musicians will laud you, and most mainstream media sources will filter the news to tell you everything you hoped you would hear. It's easy to simply emote, repeat, and feel good about yourself and be convinced the ""other guy"" must disagree with me because he is a ""bad person"", it's getting to remain in childish bliss forever.It's also that liberals like to air their opinions on social media more where younger people tend to be, and because leftism survives by duping the ignorant younger people tend to be more liberal, and as one grows up, learns more, reads more, and sees how the world actually works, and also discovers that all the horrible accusations the left throws at conservatives are mostly hogwash one tends to be more conservative. My entire life there was always some supposed ""liberal revolution"" brewing with youth, but when people grow up they become more conservative. So, Republicans get elected because there is a silent majority rolling their eyes at the left and being sick and tired of being called nasty names or accused of awful things and go vote in secret. The illustration I like to use is liberals are the guy on the track who sees the conservative 10 steps behind him and smarmily laughs his smarmy laugh mocking him… not realizing he is NOT actually 10 steps ahead of him he IS merely 10 steps away from being entirely lapped.I also think leftists are more ""into"" politics, since they think the government's job is to fix all problems it tends to be more Utopian, whereas Republicans, since they believe things are best fixed by themselves are busy pursuing innovating, making the world better personally (btw, this is empirical that Republicans give more charitable $$'s and volunteer more) they aren't as ""into"" politics, so they DO more good and shoot their mouths of less about politics.Also, if you are referring to Quora, it has a reputation of using the BNBK policy in a biased way, if you are a partisan you just define ""nice"" and ""kind"" as ""anyone who agrees with my politics"" and you get fewer conservatives because we are used to that sort of thing.

Plain and simple. Gerrymandering such that several key states that may vote in larger numbers of liberal/progressive/democratic candidates instead get a majority of none of those things… because the lines have been drawn specifically to exclude liberalism and put the whole damn fist on the scales in favor of their opponents.Then there’s the outright lying… promising the sky during the campaign season and delivering only toxic sludge once in office.

1,What is blackface?,Blackface,Jim Crow Laws,Racism in the United States of America,1!,1!,1!,"Short answer…”Black face” refers to the makeup used by a nonblack performer playing a black role.Long answer…Blackface is much more than just dark makeup used to enhance a costume.Its American origins can be traced to minstrel shows. In the mid to late nineteenth century, white actors would routinely use black grease paint on their faces when depicting plantation slaves and free blacks on stage.To be clear, these weren't flattering representations. At all. Taking place against the backdrop of a society that systematically mistreated and dehumanized black people, they were mocking portrayals that reinforced the idea that African-Americans were inferior in every way.The blackface caricatures that were staples of Minstrelsy (think: Mammy, Uncle Tom, Buck, and Jezebel) took a firm hold in the American imagination, and carried over into other mediums of entertainment.Blackface has also been seen in Vaudeville Shows and on Broadway. Yes, black actors sometimes wore blackface, too, because white audiences didn't want to see them on the stage without it.We have blackface performances to thank for some of the cartoonish, dehumanizing tropes that still manage to make their way into American culture.Beyond that, blackface and systematic social and political repression are so inextricably linked that, according to C. Vann Woodward's history The Strange Career of Jim Crow, the very term ""Jim Crow"" — usually used as shorthand for rigid anti-black segregation laws in force between the end of Reconstruction and the Civil Rights Movement — derives from an 1832 blackface minstrel number by Thomas D. Rice.",71,4,306,15,0,0

2,What do Democrats need to do NOW to defeat Trump before the run up to the 2020 Presidential elections?,2020 U.S. Presidential Election,US Presidential Elections,1!,1!,1!,1!,"The Democratic party has a significant problem right now. They don’t really have a cogent platform, and like Republicans the party is split (between moderates and those who are further left). Whether one likes Trump or not, the fact is that his foreign and domestic policy stance puts him square in the middle of the political spectrum. Bernie Sanders and anyone else like him is never going to win an election squared off against Trump. They are too far left.Trump has exploitable weaknesses. The polling still shows that he is still not widely popular, but one has to be careful about how that is interpreted. He wasn’t popular in 2016 either, and he still won because Hillary was a lousy candidate. People in general did not trust her and many did not like her. Trump was far more trustworthy than she was, and so far, Trump has been largely true to the message of his campaign.Trump has also been the subject of almost non-stop attempts at impeachment and investigations into Russian collusion. The Democrats have a serious problem with that because the perception is that it has all been politically motivated by a party that simply refuses to accept the result of a legitimate election. It hasn’t helped the perception that some in the party have been introducing regular impeachment resolutions. Although I would argue that it would help if Pelosi would shut up, she has gotten one thing right — this ongoing and continual talk of impeachment when there are no grounds will be a serious problem during the election. It will mobilize Trump’s base and others who are on the fence because it is an injustice. The Democrats need to STFU about that nonsense — pronto.The Democrat stance on illegal immigration, particularly criminal aliens is almost indefensible. Calling Trump to task because he called a bunch of MS13 animals “animals” is almost crazy. Running around calling the current administration heartless and insensitive when the Democrat party has done less than nothing to solve the problem will haunt them during the election cycle. People are not stupid. It is not the President’s responsibility to solve the immigration problem by executive fiat, like Obama tried, it’s Congress’ problem. It is wildly apparent that the Democrats don’t really want to solve the problem. They like the problem, and they love talking about it, but they never actually do anything about it.Then there is the matter of the tax cuts. If one recalls, many Republicans discovered that the platform they ran on — repealing Obamacare — was far tougher than they thought. The fact is, many people liked it because they got something for free and that makes it difficult to take away. The Democrats will find that campaigning on reversing the Republican tax bill is a mistake. The argument that it was a gift to the rich is weak, and anyone who saw an increase in their paycheck and a decrease in their tax liability will see right through that. If the Democrats campaign on repealing that, they’ll lose. American’s don’t like taxes. Nor is there much sympathy for those in high-tax blue states because they lost some deductions. If they don’t like it, then vote out the state house clowns who think that more taxes are the solution to everything.Defeating Trump in 2020 is going to be a rough go unless the Democratic party can convince the electorate that their alternative will be better for the voting electorate — not better for immigrants. In the end, people vote with their pocket books and if the Democrats march out there with a platform based on embracing violators of immigration law by rewarding individuals who snuck across the border and protecting criminal aliens in sanctuary cities simply isn’t going to fly. While many Democrats are passionate about how unfit Trump is to be President, most Americans don’t share that opinion or particularly care about the late night tweets, the gutter wars or Stormy Daniels and her sleazy lawyer. Most Americans do not believe that Trump colluded with Russians or that he is Putin’s lackey. The impeachment platform isn’t going to fly without solid evidence. And solid evidence is not a 24 hour innuendo news cycle that is obviously partisan. Nor will Democrats succeed with the weak argument that the recent tax bill should be repealed because it was a gift to the rich. Anyone with a paycheck that increased or who got a bonus will see through that rubbish.",146,3,54,87,0,0

We can only compete with a superior workforce. Our schools must be the best in the world.”“If you want to get an Art History degree, an enlistment in the Army National Guard or Air National Guard means never having to defend your choice or borrow money you can’t pay back.”Granted, that last one isn’t going to come out of the mouths of progressives.

In a sectarian country like Iraq, cross-sectarian alliances & broad-basing of elections are essential for political parties. If Iraq has to remain stable and free from terror influences then building the cross-sectarian alliances is indispensable.

The problem was created during the Reagan administration when the FCC did away with the Equal Time Rule. Roger Ailes was Reagan's media adviser.Once freed of the Equal Time Rule the media could accept money from one political party for advertising without having to provide the other party(s) with equal time. The political parties began spending hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising in the media who was freed to serve these big spenders any way they wanted. This ruling also allowed media companies to take sides and even politicize their brand as Roger Ailes did with Fox News.Because the political parties are such big customers of media advertising and so much money is involved the media are not willing to report news that is highly critical of their biggest customers. The media has a huge conflict of interest. So for example when the DNC did not want the Sanders campaign given media attention the media complied.The two parties use the media to force a binary choice between two brands.

Better than 50/50.Emmett Flood is an excellent attorney by all accounts, well-respected and knowledgeable particularly in this area of law. I don’t doubt that he’s explained to Trump what the options are and what the consequences of certain actions and certain events could be.I actually don’t doubt Trump’s ability to comprehend the danger he’s in, either. While he may play a convincing facsimile, he’s not a complete idiot. He understands the nature of PR and public image probably better than just about anyone. I suspect that it’s a primary motivator of his stepped up attacks on the Mueller investigation. Trump very likely understands that the only way he’ll survive long enough to continue to use the office to line his pockets is to discredit any investigation as a partisan witch hunt, and undermine any evidence that could come from such an investigation.The terrifying thing is that Trump might very well be succeeding.[1] An alarming number of people surveyed recently don’t know that the Mueller probe has uncovered actual crimes and gotten guilty pleas out of them.[2]Trump himself has gone on the offensive with disinformation this past weekend, stating that Mueller will certainly be meddling in the midterms and continuing his attempts to peg the registered Republican as a Democrat.[3]All this comes as Mueller moves to sentence another person in this case who will cooperate with the investigation.[4]All that, to me, suggests that Trump’s legal team has explained the consequences of this and the potential of a midterm wave, that he very well understands what it could mean, and that he is going to attempt to reshape the narrative just as he did in the 2016 election.Thanks for the A2A.Addendum: I welcome honest conversation about this with credible sources and sound reasoning.However, I do not have patience for wild monkeys flinging about their fecal matter on here.

The deep wellspring that is money laundering hasn’t even been tapped as of yet.While I don’t imagine that things have deteriorated to the point where he had to receive his briefings in the form of a Muppet-style puppet show, they certainly simplified them to the point where anybody could understand them if they chose to do so. Unfortunately, for those attorneys and those in Trump’s orbit, the following is true or seems to be:Trump has zero experience with constitutional law - He never held elected office prior to 2016. He has never taken advanced legal coursework, he’s not an attorney and his grasp of legal nuances beyond real estate law and perhaps New York state criminal law seems to be minimal, at best.Trump’s attention span is minimal - Even aides who support him have stated that Trump barely pays attention to critical briefings. They have attempted to spark his interest by including his name in documents that they want him to read; however that doesn’t really work with complex subjects.Trump’s ability to maintain control of his emotions is also apparently minimal - There are numerous stories of Trump growing extremely angry when told things that didn’t agree with his preconceptions or which challenged ideas that he “likes.” Imagine trying to explain something that is unpleasant to a person who has poor emotional control and also having to do so on multiple occasions.Trump’s overall intelligence is questionable - While his supporters routinely tout his abilities, they are often contradicted by people who know him and who actually have had dealings with him. While the man is not operating with a lower intelligence quotient, he clearly is not a genius, nor even particularly gifted. It could take days, weeks or even months to explain complicated legal strategies to such a person and there’s a strong likelihood that they still wouldn’t be able to grasp them.His ego - Trump’s massive ego is legendary. He simply doesn’t easily tolerate things that in any manner demean or diminish his self image and he demonstrates on a daily basis. To sit down and listen to attorneys who are trying to explain (again on multiple occasions) the legal peril that he is in would be depressing and dispiriting to Trump, especially since he seems to have ignored things until it was too late to mitigate them. The man has shown repeatedly that he will not accept blame for his actions and much of what he needs to understand about what his attorneys are trying help him with requires that he does so.While I believe that Trump’s attorneys have explained his legal dilemma to him on multiple occasions, because of who he is, how he views the world, his lack of emotional stability and his ego, he hasn’t accepted the cold realities that they have laid out before him. Worse for him, he listens to people who tell him what he wants to hear and accepts their viewpoints even when they conflict with objective reality.Trump’s best hope (which also seems to be fading) is that the GOP hangs onto the House of Representatives in 2018, even by a slim margin, as that will allow the GOP to continue to obfuscate and inveigle when it comes to investigating him.

The Republican party has remained the party of business interests, only changing the strategy and language in which it coated these interests, as the petite-bourgeois emerged as a significant force in American politics.

The Republican party has embraced the Jeffersonianism of the petite-bourgeois whose parents were agrarians, whereas the Democratic party has become increasingly Hamiltonian in its methods. The previous appeals to rural populations, while the latter appeals to urban populations. With suburbs splitting depending on whether their populations were formerly rural or urban.You’ll notice that there has been a convergence on regional-social issues by all segments of the population, but with the rise of Trumpism (and its reaction) this probably will change in the very near future.So yes, on political-economy the parties are mostly what they always were.

However, it’s also been the case that Democrats ended up dividing their vote across too many candidates in a swing district and thus sent two Republicans to the general election.This year, Democratic enthusiasm is high, and there’s particular enthusiasm for Democrats to flip several California districts from the Republican Party. Unfortunately for Democrats, the enthusiasm attracted too many candidates, who now risk splitting the vote and all but ensuring that Republicans hold onto those seats by virtue of failing to field a singularly successful Democratic candidate.So Democrats - locally and nationally - have flooded the spectrum to achieve two outcomes:Boost overall Democratic turnout to the point that splitting the vote might not matter too seriously, because the winning Democratic candidate will still have enough votes to advance; and,As mentioned previously, try and force some candidates out of the race (unlikely) or scuttle their candidacies with negativity (because that’s been working so well lately).The Republicans, meanwhile, simply don’t have this problem.

If Trump is not draining the swamp as promised, that’s because the enemy is trying to destroy him and undermine the national good to serve their interests. If, after campaigning about the evils of China stealing American jobs, Trump is now working to secure Chinese jobs, the reason must have something to do with the misdeeds of nefarious liberals and RINOs.

This crowed includes the who's who of current Democratic power players including the Clintons, Pelosi, Sanders and Warren to name a few.

He was repeatedly bashed as not a true Republican by some of the party's biggest stars. But he excited the base, and in the general all those Republicans who opposed him fell in line and voted along party lines. The terrible Republican was still better than a Democrat, and all those who stayed home were outweighed by the energised who showed up.

They also lost more than a dozen governorships.The centrist strategy doesn’t work, and Donald Trump demonstrated the truth of this by focusing his attention almost entirely on the conservative base at the far right of the Republican party. It makes sense, because if you focus on the center, you are focusing on a limited pool of voters who will always be divided among the two parties. The center can never provide either party a large block of votes.The flaw in the centrist strategy is the false assumption that every voter to the left of center will vote for the Democrat, and the center will provide the votes needed to win. The reason that’s a false assumption is that the far left has abandoned the Democratic party and is no longer voting at all. They feel completely disenfranchised.If the Democrats learn anything from the 2016 election, I hope they learn that they must reclaim the party’s base.

They want to be inspired. They crave for a fresh voice that demands change.What type of Republican is Trump? A conservative Republican? I don’t believe so. At least, I don’t believe he saw maintaining a rigid conservative philosophy as being central to his campaign message. Trump capitalized on a wave of intense resentment in middle America overlooked by almost everyone else, including other Republicans.

Which kind of Democrat could best attract the independent vote?",2020 U.S. Presidential Election,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"My answer would be to look at how Obama did it, and then to follow that example.Obama ran to the left of Hillary for the nomination in 08. He was forthrightly and unambiguously against the Iraq War, taking a pro-diplomacy pro-peace stance, reinforcing that by a call to start talking directly with Iran. And yet he won the nomination and the election, not once but twice. From that I conclude that THIS IS NOT 1976 OR 1992. There is a center-left pro-peace winning presidential coalition out there if one has a candidate with the smarts and charisma to target, create and lead it. So that’s my starting-point.Today’s politics is polarized. The name of the game is not to win over centrists or independents. The name of the game is to energize and turn out the base. That’s how Obama did in 08 and 12 and that’s how Trump did it in 16. And, conversely, Hillary’s failure to do so in 16 led to a Democratic defeat not only for the presidency but in the Senate as well (one forgets that the 2016 Senate landscape was also supposed to favor Dems, since there were more Reps than Dems up for re-election, another indication of how thoroughly the Dems fell flat on their faces in 16).Which means that a presidential candidate who can’t excite the base need not apply. In that category, I put Clinton-style folks like Booker, Cuomo, Hickenlooper, Klobuchar and McAuliffe.Candidates who seem to have the potential to excite the base include Brown, de Blasio, Gabbard, Merkley, Sanders and Warren.Then there are the candidates who don’t clearly fit either category. There are three of those: Biden, Gillibrand and Harris. While all three tack left on certain issues, and have some appeal to the base as a result, they’re not card-carrying outsiders, but they’re not card-carrying pro-war pro-Wall Street establishment types either. Is a combo candidate like one of those three the answer? Or is the Dem party better off with someone unambiguously “base”, like Brown or Warren? Personally I think the Brown/Warren type is the better bet, but I can see one of the three combo candidates catching fire if they play their cards right.Now, the second half of your question appears to presume a certain answer for the first half, i.e. a moderate or “another kind” of Democrat. So answering it is somewhat misleading, but I’ll answer it anyway.Obama never won a majority of the white vote or of the white union blue-collar vote. However he won enough of them to win the Rust Belt states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. This is because he was able to attract a sizable percentage of independents. He didn’t win a majority of them, nor does a winning Democrat need to so (in fact, those who put that on the top of their priority list are probably losers). But he was able to win enough of them so that WHEN ADDED TO ALL THE OTHER CONSTITUENCIES HE WON it was enough to eke out a win. That’s the sweet spot, in terms of the proper goal for independents on the part of a plausible Democratic presidential candidate. It’s not the silver bullet or the secret to a Democratic win however; in fact, in stupid, idiotic, dumb hands, that goal can actually kill the candidacy, as I believe it killed Hillary’s.",181,3,13,64,0,0

Telling people with whom you disagree that they are evil is going to seriously bring down political and social discourse because I mean…why would you even talk to this guy if you think he’s a Nazi? Personally I’m a big fan of watching debates, from the brothers Hitchens’ face off, Bill Nye vs Ken Ham, Sam Harris’ ‘talk’ with Cenk Uygur, Ann Coulter (all her debates are great), Ben Shapiro’s debates, Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, Dinesh D’Souza, I’ve retroactively gone back and watched every presidential debate from Bush Sr onwards (and clips going back to Nixon vs JFK), a lot of Buckley’s Firing Line, Fry and Peterson vs Goldberg and Dyson, etc. I have noticed and increasing level of hostility (usually coming from the left of the aisle but not always) towards opponents. Recently when Peterson and Fry debates Dyson and Goldberg, we saw Michael Eric Dyson describe his opponent (Peterson) as a “mean, mad white man” and sit there while Peterson was talking making stupid noises rather loudly and obnoxiously and frankly childishly. When I was a kid and I was arguing with a friend or sibling, that was what you’d expect. Not from an adult for crying out loud. Dyson didn’t see Peterson as another human being who he simply disagreed with. He saw him by his immutable characteristics. He’s a white guy. That’s what he saw.There’s always the possibility that this will be good long term. The reason I say this is like when you’ve got a romantic couple or two friends and after a while they despise each other…and then they just say everything they’ve wanted to say about why they hate each other and what they should do to change and their life story (or have a fist fight in the case of two guys)…sometimes the relationship dies and sometimes it blossoms. Maybe ten years or so down the road we start to realise that the other people in this world aren’t all that bad they just have differing views and we live with each other. Personally I’m of the view that even during those old, classy debates such as the William F. Buckley’s Firing Line, even though everyone was respectful there’s a good chance that a lot of the lefties were on there thinking “f**ling fascist” while Buckley was looking back at them thinking “f**king commie” but they maintained their civility.

This is a technique the Russians have used for many decades to foment chaos in smaller countries, and the US intelligence services clearly see it - although the Trump officials want to deny it.Evidence also clearly shows that Putin had a grudge against Hillary Clinton because she called him what he is and he expected that she would make life rough for him if elected. So Putin clearly had a MOTIVE (a strong one) to defeat her, and much of the aforementioned advertising was clearly designed to spread untruths about her. Also, the Russian “advertising” appearing to come from the “far left” was clearly influential in promoting Bernie Sanders over Hillary.What is not entirely clear at this point is whether the Russian campaign had as its ulterior motive to help Trump win. The evidence is not as clear as I would like to see about this. It seems more likely that its goal was to help Hillary lose. This, of course, is one of the things Mueller’s team is investigating.What is also not entirely clear is the extent to which the Trump campaign actively colluded in such a campaign vs being duped by it. There’s plenty of evidence that they violated campaign financing and other laws, but it seems that in at least some of those cases they did so inadvertently because they lacked experience running a national political campaign.It is also obvious to me that if any of this had happened as part of Obama’s election, the Republicans would be all over it, with many investigations and accusations and such.

Around 2012 a cabal formed around Robert Mercer, a hyperwealthy would-be political fixer who’d already had some notable success making predictions on market conditions based in software aggregating datum pulling from social media cross-indexed with a number of other sources. Motivated by a stripped out and retooled version of libertarianism(to wit: He believes that individual american should only be valued by their currency generating potential, and that the extremely wealthy should suffer no constraints or restrictions to conduct business in any way they see fit.

He’d been making donations and trying to shake things behind the curtain quietly for years with little effect. Around 2014 he threw his weight behind Cambridge Analytica, a subsidiary of SCL group whom as you may know now from recent press coverage. A company that sought via software, machine learning, and big data harvesting to apply psychological warfare tactics to so-called ‘swing’ voters. More broadly, it is also intended to push public opinion inline with preset goals in statistically and strategically meaningful ways. You don’t have to move the majority, he noted. You just have to move the minority that the majority inevitably drifts along behind. You just have to push statistically meaningful numbers of cultivated people favorable to the end goal to the vote , and discourage those who weren’t favorable from voting altogether. His group proof-of-concept tested the whole engine on the Brexit vote, and it worked. Busy little kingmaker that he is, he immediately turned his attention to the upcoming US election salivating. First deploying it to push out a candidate favorable to his personal goals out to the front of a fractured party, and then to push the election itself with the full might of that parties tactical warchest force multiplying his efforts. However anyone feels about Trump, it’s important to remember he was selected and pushed through not because of any real personal relationship he had with Bob Mercer, but because he was the most likely to be amenable to further Bob’s long term goals.Bob finally got his wish. He got his cabals entry into Washington DC power brokering, using the RNC as a disposable condom stepping stone. He had the access to start positioning people who were either favorable to his weird, twisted idea of what america should be, or already onboard with his cabal to begin with. Many members of his group, like Bob himself have a publicly documented and deep standing contempt of the RNC that is only marginally less powerful than his outright hate of the DNC, and clearly view them as little more than a means to an end of staging an internal coup d’etat inside the halls of power itself. Whether he will succeed, or even be brought to trial for usurping the democratic process, hijack the fate of a nation, and bid to place himself plus his select few as the untouchable éminence grise of DC going forward largely depends on you, the people rising up in outrage. Of not getting distracted by a reality show reject who at best is a rubber stamping perfect-storm-of-distraction stooge, and at worst a colluder. Though I consider this latter possibility remote. The evidence i’ve examined point towards Mercer being the domestic instigator ultimate source, and his son-in-law being the most likely proxy to any interested foreign powers involved. I also do not see any convincing prima facie evidence of these two disparate elements having any collusion or meaningful contact with each other…Though i’d be hard pressed to believe that either was completely unaware of the other’s reach, impact, or capabilities just from the amount of press both have generated. In particular, i’d venture a strong guess that the RNC has a very short span to burn this cancer from their midst before Mercer positions himself and his own as gatekeepers of it’s free agency. Probably a handful of years, at best. But I have no way of guessing with any accuracy. It’s just a projected timeline based on their meteoric rise thus far.

They make their living from fake news websites, but found that for Americans only the sites aimed at Republicans made them money. Reputable pollsters have found the same thing.

18,Do Democrats really believe that Russia influenced Americans to vote for Trump?,Democrats (non-specific),US Presidential Elections,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Democrats do not believe the explanations given by Trump and his administration. It doesn’t help that Trump started off lying and seem intent upon continuously promoting alt-facts. Democrats are closely watching to see the verified facts. What has come out so far confirms that voters were targeted by a sophisticated Russian effort to influence the 2016 election. So says the Senate committee, today. It contradicts the House committee, which is now run by Trump’s cronies. The Senate Committee states that they believe the intelligence reports - reports by all 17 intelligence agencies.It also appears that foreign governments provided millions of dollars in support of Trump’s campaign. For example, $25 million donated by the NRA matches the same amount the NRA received from a Russian oligarch.Did either act influence your vote? Maybe. Maybe not. Did it have an impact? - you betcha. Denying it is just plain silly.Was there collusion? Clearly, there was attempted collusion by the Trump campaign and Russians. Is this evidence of collusion? It’s smoke, not fire.Today the Federal Ethic Office releases testimony by Trump’s son, where he clearly lied about the now infamous meeting with Russian spies in Trump tower. The documents were released because some of the documents had been unlawfully removed from a federal database. An attempted cover up? Perhaps.Keep in mind that all of this is just news reporting on an ongoing FBI investigation, an investigation which will find what it finds.Now, you can believe whatever you want. How could a foreign government influence Trump? Why did Trump suddenly back off sanctions against a Chinese telecom company? Is it a quid pro quo? Perhaps. Today in a federal disclosure Trump admitted that he paid his lawyer to pay off a porn star. He previously denied knowledge of the payment.Why don’t Democrats believe Trump? He lies.

18,Do Democrats really believe that Russia influenced Americans to vote for Trump?,Democrats (non-specific),US Presidential Elections,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Many Republicans who were not happy with their party's nominee for president in 2016 went out and voted for him anyway, because they believed that however undesirable he might be, he was still far preferable than the Democratic nominee. This belief was the fruit of 20 years of character assassination from the right wing media, not just against Hillary Clinton, but against the despised “Libtards” (Democrats). Unless the Russians have been working on this for 20 years, then what happened in 2016 was just building on a foundation that had already been laid.The question of Russian involvement is less important with respect to its impact on the election outcome than whether the Trump campaign sought and gained their support. I personally believe James Comey had a far greater impact on the election, and I certainly don't think he was colluding with the Russians, nor with the Trump campaign. And Comey's “October Surprise” wouldn't have been so effective if the electorate had not already been primed with previous allegations of treachery against Hillary from our own right wing media and Republican-led Inquisition Panels.What's more… The very possibility that Russia could influence the election is indicative of another, far deeper problem with our system of campaigns and elections… that we give moneyed interests such an outsized voice in the entire election process, notably including “people” who are corporations. This is a self-inflicted wound, not of Russian origin. (My metaphor puts me in mind of someone who keeps a gun to protect his home from burglars, and accidentally shoots himself in the head while cleaning it.)My feeling about the election is that Trump ought never have been the Republican nominee, and if nominated, the election ought never have been so close. I didn't watch the election returns Nov 8, 2016, because I found it too upsetting that Trump would win even one state. I just walked alone around the streets of my home town, wondering how we had gotten ourselves into such a situation. I wouldn't have felt that way if it had been Hillary vs. Bush III. Bottom line:. I don't blame the outcome on Russian meddling. Rather I defer to Walt Kelly in his assessment, now more than half a century old, that, “We have met the enemy, and he is us.”",1.5k,28,94,149,0,0

3,Would the US Democratic party fall to the left or the right of the UK Labour party?,Labour Party (UK politics),Politics of the United Kingdom,1!,1!,1!,1!,"There is a problem answering this question without having a universal concept of what “left-wing” and “right-wing” entail.Historically “left-wing” described those political tendencies which aimed to change the current social system (of that period) to become less hierarchical and to expand socio-political and economic power to more people.“Right wing” described those who thought certain social hierarchies were necessary in order to maintain societal stability and/or to maintain a certain level of prosperity.Getting bogged down by country-specific policies tends to obscure things.For example, one can say “The Democrats are to the right of the British Conservative party because the United States doesn’t have universal health-care and the Conservatives support the NHS.” Of course if the United States had an NHS would anybody be in doubt that the Democrats (or many Republicans) would support it in the same way they support Medicare?One can counter, “The Labour party is to the right of the Republican party because a large majority aren’t small “r” republicans and if the left-right paradigm was about anything it was about republicanism vs. monarchism. Was that not what the French Revolution, which embodied this paradigm, was about?” Again, if Britain were a republic would the Labour Party consist of mostly monarchists?If it isn’t obvious already, it is very hard to compare the political parties which work in very different systems. To my American eyes the British support for monarchy (regardless of how benign or neutered it might be) is right-wing/center-right. Class hierarchies are still formalized and institutionalized in the political and social systems. To the British eyes the American opposition to universal healthcare (without considering the strong support for it or the structural problems of the American political system) is right-wing.The best that can be said is that for any particular topic which can be generalized the Democrats are shifted to the left of, right of, or similar to the Labour party. On cultural issues, the Democrats are pretty left-wing. On civic issues,they are shifting leftward.

1,Is there evidence that George Soros is anti American or is he a victim of fear mongering?,George Soros,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"George Soros is a billionaire hedge fund manager who is known for his support of numerous liberal and far left causes through various organizations. He operates largely in secret so much of the details about his activities are unknown. He deserves much criticism because he is unethical and a hypocrite. A short list of his not so nice activities follows.Convicted of Insider Trading. In 1988, George Soros profited from inside knowledge of a takeover of a French bank (Societe Generale). He was eventually convicted in 2002. Soros lost repeated appeals including those with France’s highest court and the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). The ECHR determined that Soros knew he was breaking the law, yet Soros still has not paid the fines.Hypocritical Tax Beliefs. George Soros frequently says that rich people should pay more in taxes but built most of his initial fortune by exploiting tax loopholes. Soros deferred the taxes paid on fees by his clients which he then invested allowing them to grow. Bloomberg (a company most known for business news, data, and analysis) estimates that Soros amassed $13.3 billion just from these deferrals alone. The US government closed the loophole and ordered Soros to repay $6.7 billion. If George Soros really believes that the rich should pay more in taxes, this was the perfect opportunity to pay more – just abide by the law. Instead Soros responded by moving all of the money in question to Ireland, a known tax haven.Secret Attempts to Turn the US away from Israel and to turn Israel into an international pariah which can then be destroyed. Soros’ Open Society Foundation (OSF) has spent the last 8 years funding a clandestine network of groups to achieve this. The OSF promotes transparency and yet deliberately kept the source of the funding hidden.Illegally Overspending On Political Campaigns. Through George Soro’s group America Coming Together, spent $137 million in 2004, most of which violated federal election limits, in an effort to see John Kerry elected President.Broke the Bank of England. Through currency manipulation, Soros caused the British pound to crash wiping out 3.3 billion pounds from the government’s coffers, exacerbating a recession, and destroying the livelihoods of millions of people. George Soros doesn’t care how many people got hurt. All that matters to him is that he made one billion pounds.Broke the Bank of Thailand. Along with Julian Robertson, Soros attacked Thailand’s currency wiping out more than 60% of its value. When Thai’s central bank responded poorly, they closed in for the kill. Millions of Thais were left unemployed and impoverished while 600,000 foreign workers were forced to leave due to lack of work. The damage spread to the economies of Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Brazil, Russia, and sparked a violent revolution in Indonesia that killed several thousand people. But George Soros doesn’t care about any of that. The only thing that matters to him is that he made a lot of money.Tried to Destroy the Economy of Hong Kong through currency manipulation. It was only due to Hong Kong’s financial secretary Donald Tsang Yam-kuen that this attempt was thwarted. Yam-kuen sunk $118 billion Hong Kong Dollars into the stock market to block Soros’ currency manipulations. It cost the government and severely hurt Hong Kong’s reputation among financiers but it stopped a full meltdown which would have almost certainly triggered a world-wide recession.His so called Philanthropic efforts almost always serve his own pocketbook. One common tactic is to use “philanthropic” donations to open previously closed developing countries so he can take ownership of important assets in those countries at bargain prices. E.g. he gave millions of dollars of aid to Kosovo so that he could then buy a gold and silver mine worth over $5 billion for the bargain basement price of $50 million (only 1% of its worth).A few random items.George Soros financed much of the violent anti-Trump post election demonstrations. Many protesters were hired in response to advertisements for paid anti-Trump protesters that appeared in Seattle, Portland, Chicago, Pittsburgh, Boston, Denver, Philadelphia, New York, etc. There were organized efforts involving hundreds of buses transporting thousands of protesters to these “spontaneous” demonstrations.Soros colluded with various European big wigs to incite the refugee crisis.Soros owns the voting machines in 16 U.S. states which are to be used in the upcoming election.George Soros has major personality problems. Every 20 years, trades his current wife for a 20 year younger trophy wife. He is currently on his third wife. Soros is known for his mistreatment of women and has had numerous sex scandals. George Soros has a god complex. From his memoir The Alchemy of Finance,“To put it bluntly, I fancied myself as some kind of god.” Soros really believes that he is above the rules that apply to others.But liberals give generally give George Soros a pass on everything because he contributes money to liberal causes. Even his support to some of the liberal causes are really to butter his own bread. For example, George Soros has funded much of the pro drug legalization efforts of recent years. But what these groups will not tell you is that they are funded by George Soros and the Soros has positioned himself to profit from drug legalization by buying large tracts of land in South America and by forging alliances with South American Coca Leaf producers. George Soros is not a nice guy.Edit: Someone asked for some references, so here are some for the major (numbered) items.Convicted of Insider Tradinghttps://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/...https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bil...https://dealbook.nytimes.com/201...https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/...2.

I'm not sure I understand what you mean by using that word in this context. A narrative is a story line, and it is not used by one party against the other here.This “story” began when the very Conservative The Beacon hired Steele to investigate Trump's ties to Russia. Or it began when the Intel communities in several European countries, while surveilling Russians known to be close to the Kremlin (Putin), started to pick up on people on Trump's campaign team contacting, or being contacted by, said Russians. They then notified the FBI.Take your pick. Those two incidents must have happened almost simultaneously, and no Democrats were involved in ordering the now famous Steele dossier at the time.At some point The Beacon must have received information from Steele that wouldn't be harmful only to Trump, but also to the GOP. They decided to shut the investigation down. By that time, the FBI was on to what went on with certain people on Trump's campaign team. By that time, Steele was worried about what he had found out about several of Trump's people, and their vulnerability to classical, Russian Kompromat, or blackmail if you will. To him the FBI seemed uninterested in what he had told them, and as far as I understand it; he contacted the DNC to hear if they were interested in taking over his investigation where the Conservatives had left off. They apparently were. We don't know what the FBI knew at that point, but we know that they have verified a lot of the things Steel had found out.The Democrats’ “narrative” consists of them being represented in the House committees investigating this, and their wish to find out what actually happened. The “narrative” of the Democrats is aligned with the part of the global population that cares about what goes on in the government of the most powerful country on earth. It is also remarkably closely aligned with the never Trump Conservatives who knew who and what Candidate Trump was, and had been, his entire adult life.The only people who are scared stiff about what will come out of this in the end, are the people who are 100% certain that Trump will be exonerated (like he says he will) when the Mueller investigation comes to an end. Or what will come out of any of the other investigations, for that matter, but the Russia investigation in particular.Robert Mueller III is a Republican, appointed by a Republican, and approved of by the Republicans in Congress.The Democrats are simply represented in the Congressional committees that are investigating this. The narrative in the Trump-Russia saga is completely in the hands of Republicans.",129,1,237,568,0,0

3,If Donald Trump can pull off the peace talks with North Korea will that make him a better president than Bush and Obama?,George W. Bush,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"Against all answers here my would be certainly and undoubtedly yes. There is huge difference between how Westerners look on Obama foreign policy and how the people actually been effected by it does. Well, most times.Short summary for Obama foreign policy: He received the Nobel prize for peace for absolutely nothing moment after he won his first elections. Why? the European Nobel committee want him to justify the prize. So, how well he did that?First, shortly after he became the president N.Korea returned to its nuclear program. He failed to response.Then he turned his back to Egypt and supported the protests against the government of Mubarak, leading to that the Muslim brotherhood (very good friends of Al Qaeda and ISIS) came to power, just to be overthrown by the Egyptian army (not thanks to Obama). Egypt then strengthened its relations with Russia because it understood the US is not a reliable ally.Gaddafi was a dictator who supported terror, had secret nuclear program (that no secret service outside Libya knew about, but was very close to finalization) and anti American. He decided to come clean about his nuclear program, offered compensations for terror attacks supported by Libya and asked to improve his relations with the US, unconditionally. It worked good at the beginning but then riots against his dictatorship started. Without taking advise from congress Obama along with France and UK took out Gaddafi. Giving rise to ISIS there.Russia invaded Crimea, I’m not saying whether Russia was wrong or right, just saying that Obama failed to response, again. During Bush time Russia invaded Georgia but fast and decisive action of the POTUS then led to that its forces withdrawal from there in less than two weeks. Obama, the most pro-EU president ever, enacted- along with the EU, sanctions over Russia.In Syria, Assad used chemical weapons to massacre his civilian opposition. Obama drew red line but set a record as the first president that didn’t enforce it when it was violated. By that he showed weakness and invited Russia to enter the void he left there.His policy in Libya and Syria fueled the refugee crisis which in turn led to the Brexit. Irony, the most pro-EU president was actually ruining it with his reckless and clueless policies.I will not elaborate about that he ignored the Iranians that were protesting against the Ayatollahs regime and asking for US help back in 2009. I will not elaborate about the disastrous JCPOA agreement with Iran, signed against the congress opinion and against all of the US allies in the Middle East. Sure, the EU liked it- they could return to do business with Iran and low oil prices helped the EU to return to modest positive economical growth. They don’t think too much about how nuclear arms race in the Middle East, on their door step actually, could effect them in less than a decade (and the JCPOA promise just that).So, how can Trump do better?Like Trump or not, like his style or not- he’s effective.First, if he could get to workable agreement with N.Korea - one which give more freedoms for the citizens of N.Korea (even if only relative) and establish trade relations between North and South Korea (and perhaps Japan and the US too) it would be huge achievement, on historical scale, even with only partial denuclearization.Second, by withdrawing from the JCPOA Trump restored the trust of US allies in the Middle East. The Arab league, representing 22 Arab countries in the Middle East, greeted him for this bold decision, so does Israel. If restoring the sanctions (that Bush started in 2006) would lead to regime change in Iran or at least to its withdrawal from its highly aggressive policies in the Middle East (and beyond) that would be another achievement on historical scale.Currently, Trump, Israel and Russia are in negotiations to achieve stability in Syria. It’s possible that agreeing on stability in Syria would lead also to Russian policy change in Crimea and to major improvement in US-Russia relations. That could be another great achievement.Trump is far from being the idiot media outlets in the US make him look like. He managed savvy negotiations with the Chinese and analysis of his actions showed a well planed foreign policy.I think he’s aiming at these goals. He’s also aiming at Venezuela that already released American prisoner. Unlike Obama he wouldn’t fly to Cuba or any other country without making conditions first. He’s not afraid to use the huge economical and military advantage of the US, these are not decorations but tools in his opinion. He’s speaking business, not BS.",400,10,559,626,0,0

Do a number of those and maybe most Americans would agree he was a good president - i.e. making life better for many.Becoming a real world leader across the various challenges would be a good start too - start to tackling climate change, persuading Russia and China to cease their cyber warfare against the west, persuading Russia to accept the territorial integrity of Ukraine (all of it); re-engaging with Iran to prevent them from developing nuclear weapons ?

Korea, President Trump’s successes in his first year and half highlight how really terrible the administrations of his two immediate predecessors were:Whatever Bush’s justification, sending the American military into Afghanistan and Iraq to chase various groups of radical Islamists did not forward our national interests in any way, and cost us enormous amounts of blood and treasure.Meanwhile, Bush failed to recognize the effects of the Community Reinvestment Act in time to prevent the Great Recession. Had he addressed the problem of issuing mortgages to unqualified borrowers immediately after taking office, we could have avoided one of the most devastating economic losses in the history of our country.I suspect that nothing anyone could have done would have prevented Obama from being elected. Even conservatives I knew voted for him because they wanted to elect a black president and bring an end to the long history of racism in this country.Little did they guess that Obama would reinvigorate the division between people of color and the rest of the country. His entire administration was a constant scold for the sins of having once been a country that participated in slavery (never mind that we fought a long, bloody war to end it!), that enacted Jim Crow Laws (although we did enact Civil Rights legislation to change them), and that still faced inequality with regard to education and employment opportunity.Not that Obama’s administration changed anything — black unemployment increased, educational parity decreased, no effort was made to address the black-on-black murder rate in the urban inner cities, and general civility between the races, social divisions, and economic classes declined.At the same time, Obama was one of the most ineffective military presidents the U.S. ever had the misfortune to elect. His foreign policy consisted of an extended apology to the rest of the world for our existence as a country, and his economic policy was an attempt to strangle the business environment entirely.Trump’s rapid successes in destroying ISIS in Iraq, rejuvenating the economy, and restoring the confidence and competitiveness of the U.S. were the result of the right policy prescriptions, but were also due to the depths the United States had fallen to.",193,8,46,806,0,0

All presidents have the ability to make mistakes and later change and turn a very poor presidency into a much better one. At present, Trump is inconsistent, arrogant, in denial, and has made a lot of very poor decisions. Can he roll back on them, reinstate Obama’s, etc. policies of before and adding some positive achievements of his own? Of course he can but he does need to not only make peace with North Korea but also do a deal with Iran and build on the positivity of what went before him for him to be as good as Obama was. Judging Trump now shows he is very near the bottom of the pile regarding presidents but it is really up to him if he wants to stay there or rebrand himself and achieve a few positive breakthroughs on the world stage. Or else he may get lucky with for example a bloodless overthrow of the Islamic Republic of Iran and a replacement with a moderate Republic of Iran that had nothing to do with him.All presidents’ reputation are often determined by luck. Jimmy Carter was a decent president but the Iranian revolution, Afghanistan invasion and the Iran-Iraq war all conspired to bring him down. JFK certainly had more to achieve but was killed in his prime. Richard Nixon achieved a lot of diplomatic breakthroughs and may well be one of the best modern presidents until Watergate overshadowed his many moderate policy achievements like opening up relations with China and improving relations with the USSR. Ronald Reagan was helped by the historic events of his time when a moderate USSR came into being and a lot of the cold war conflicts could be toned down for good.

The media has a 24/7 narrative that is targeted at low information voters. I had a discussion the other day with an elderly woman who was certain Trump was ending social security and Medicare….and she received this information from the Trump campaign. I told her I was a news junkie and never heard anything remotely about this topic…in fact although I believe these programs need to be reformed to insure their survivability, Trump has not signaled that he had any intention of doing so.What I didn’t do was lecture her that the president does not have the Constitutional authority to change a law passed by comgress…despite the fact that Obama did it a lot. Executive actions and presidential memoranda are sesigned to help facilitate laws by congress to reduce the negative impact on citizens with regard to the new laws.What Obama did was use his authority as president to bypass Congress…which is not allowed. So why didn’t they fight him in court. Because the judicial process works very slowly and has many levels. At the lower levels, these were Obama appointees and so they would rule on his behalf. When it finally made it to the supreme court, it would be oberturned…but that could take years. DACA was one such violation. They could not get it through Congress and so he did it by executive action. That pretty much makes the 435 members of congress pointless.

2,What were liberals thinking when they complained about the picture of caged migrant children because they thought it happened under Trump when it actually happened under Obama?,Obama Administration,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"First, I’m going to assume that the photo is accurate, that it is indeed from 2014 (as some claim). Yep, there are plenty of cases of unescorted minors who show up at the US border seeking asylum.Second, what a number of people (and the OP is wrong to say “liberals” b/c it includes a wide range of people on the political spectrum) are upset with the Trump administration for their deliberate and intentional change in policy to separate children (including infants) from parents when they show up seeking asylum. This is from Slate: “Earlier this month, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced plans to criminally prosecute “100 percent” of migrants illegally crossing the border with Mexico. That essentially meant it suddenly became official U.S. policy to separate children from their parents whereas before families would usually be kept together in shelters while they underwent asylum or deportation proceedings. But when he announced his new policy Sessions outright said the separation of children and their parents would be inevitable and brushed off concerns by saying that it would send a clear message to potential migrants.” And this is from Vanity Fair: “As the Associated Press notes, the previous “catch and release” policy Trump and his administration cite as the reason for increased border crossings was put into place in 2008 by then-president George W. Bush, and was primarily created to combat the influx of children fleeing to the U.S. from Central American countries due to a surge of child-trafficking. Under Trump, however, that policy has changed. In the past, the Office of Refugee Resettlement traditionally placed unaccompanied minors—that is, children who cross the border withouta parent—in government-run detention centers. If a parent and a child came together, they would be processed together. In recent months, however, the Trump administration has begun forcibly taking children from their parents—some as young as one year old—and warehousing them in facilities far away from their parents, as if they had crossed the border alone.”Again, I’ll assume that the photo is indeed from 2014. If it’s a photo of a facility that is in compliance, then it’s a situation where two unaccompanied minors showed up at the border without parents. However, consistent with the new policy under the Trump Administration, if that picture had been taken in 2017 or 2018, it could be of children who arrived with parents and then were forcibly separated, even if their application for asylum was granted.As for the argument of “what were liberals thinking?”…it’s more than just liberals who are appalled at this Trump policy of deliberately separating children (even infants) from their parents: The Act Of Ripping Children From Their Families Is Un-Conservative",698,22,698,"2,070",0,4

But you have to keep in mind that as President, Obama has limited authority in matters like these. The people who should be held responsible are the men and women who make up congress, which if memory serves me, were majority Republican when this photo was taken.If you remember, Obama did sign an executive order to address the (separate but related) issue of immigrants brought here illegally as children, for which his actions were attacked as unconstitutional because it purposefully went around congress, who opposed it.If you’re asking what liberals were thinking when they complained about this picture, as a liberal, I would be thinking, how can anyone treat children like this? Why would anyone, regardless of politics, think this is acceptable? If this photo were taken today, I am sure Trump could be held more accountable because shares the same political party as most of congress, and because he does, he has more influence on their decisions.

At least he largely directed ICE to focus on undocumented immigrants with criminal records, and didn’t have the Border Patrol grab people’s kids away from them at the edge of the country as a matter of policy, because performative cruelty is much more of a white power kind of thing.

And it’s not like some of the people with criminal records ICE seized and tossed out of the country in 2015 didn’t leave families behind.Obama’s immigration policies were lousy, with too much effort focused on the immigrants and too little on stemming the demand by punishing the people who employed those immigrants for crap wages.

1,What was the breaking point for you when you decided to no longer support the National Democratic Party?,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"I didn’t ever support them, mostly because all my adult interactions with DNC member were fairly terrible.All through school, teachers tried to couch the Democrats as the best thing for everyone. I remember the first time a teacher ever tried to explain the difference between Democrats ad Republicans; she said ‘Democrats look for the best way, the newest way, to help people, while Republicans don’t.’Wow, who would’ve thought that a teacher in New Jersey would be left leaning?But I also started to notice, shortly before high school, how a lot of my left-leaning teachers seemed oddly enamored with despotism and despotic figures. I had a history teacher give an hour-long lecture on how great Che Guevara was in the 90s. Back then, we didn’t have Wikipedia, but we did have Cuban neighbors who remembered Guevara from right before they fled the nation. I began to wonder how a person who taught history could have such an absurd view of a man who was so terrible (and the more of his own works I read, the more I realized Guevara was a piece of garbage who was only brave when slaughtering unarmed innocents).In high school, I went to a military high school. I didn’t really vibe with the much more right-leaning nature of the campus, but one of our history teachers introduced me to libertarian thinkers, and I kind of naturally drifted that way, even while wearing a drab gray uniform and beret.In college, my interactions with Democrats, whether they were local politicians or just the student Democrats, were increasingly sickening.I went to college during the sudden outburst of interest in Darfur, a place most people only knew because it was popular.Our college democrats decided to hold an ‘event’ to ‘commiserate’ with those suffering in Darfur.This ‘event’ involved sitting in the gym and playing board games and video games on the jumbo screen while not eating for a day, then having a huge pizza party. There was no actual learning about what was happening in Darfur, just self-righteous bs.They tried to guilt students into coming, including me. I was in ROTC at the time, and not eating for a day would’ve completely screwed up my workout regime. Even better, the chosen day for their event was the same as the day for our six-mile run and ultimate frisbee at ROTC.Plus, let’s be honest; I had better things to do then sit around and pretend I knew about Darfur.My campus had a Catholic priest from the region who talked fluently about what was going on in Darfur. No one seemed to care to hear his side, so one day I sat in his office and listened.I learned, in about twenty minutes, that many in Darfur were simply trying to avoid slaughter in the middle of a debate between ‘black’ and ‘arab’ muslims (both looked the exact same). The arab muslims were picking on the black, and both were picking on Christians. Meanwhile, the Sudanese government just didn’t care to help anyone, and were allegedly providing material support to the ‘arab’ muslims.Hilariously, a year later, two Darfuri refugee families moved into our area. The college democrats, sadly, didn’t care about Darfur anymore. They’d moved on to the next cause celebre.You know who gave the Darfuris clothing, bedding, food, and medical care, and showed them around the weirdly shaped city of Cincinnati?Catholic students.The student democrats had another event, every single year, to ‘understand’ homelessness. This ‘event’ was more a ‘party’ than an actual learning experience.Students would attend a pizza party where a formerly homeless guy would lecture to them about his experience, generally talking about how a local program (usually from Talbert House) helped turn his life around. This guy was usually making 70K a year or more and had an inspirational story to tell. He wasn’t the filthy kind of homeless person that inhabits 2nd and 3rd street in Cincinnati, Ohio, or the ones who live under the overpass where Dunn Humby used to have a parking lot.After their preening holier-than-thou events, they would retreat to the quad with beers, laptops, extension chords, plastic bags and cardboard boxes. They would then sleep in the quad on a warm-ish night in a cardboard box fort.That was the running theme in what the college Democrats did. They spent their time looking down on people who wouldn’t come to their lame events, then preened themselves as if they had made a difference.You know who did make a difference? The two dozen Catholic students who went to feed the homeless every week, or who talked me into building a house with Habitat for Humanity, or who went down to disaster zones.The same people that the college Democrats constantly insulted and denigrated.As an adult, most Democrats I’ve met have been hypocritical snobs. They think they know what people need better than they do, and they think they’re better able to spend your money than you are.I’m a libertarian, and that’s where I’ll stay.

Because it gives the person watching a reason to continue watching. They’re not interested in dry statistics or long boring factual arguments.

And if they don’t get these things, they get so mad, feel so personally wounded, that they start to act in line with those limited emotional needs instead of in line with a broader picture.For example, conservatives oppose policies that give cops the right to distinguish gun owners from felons, even while those same conservatives pretend that they support both cops and gun owners. No rational person, let alone a conservative, would oppose the right for a cop to know whether a person they’re about to interact with is a legal gun owner; neither would any rational person, let alone a conservative, believe that legal gun owners should have no way to prove that they’re legally allowed to own guns. And yet, because they stopped thinking about policies with their heads, and started thinking about it with their hearts, conservatives have decided to stop supporting the law, because they’re just *that* worried that cops will take their guns away.

5,"In most modern democratic national elections, what percentage of the votes are made almost entirely on the voter's emotional response to the images of the running leaders?",Voting Reform,Voting in the American Elections,Voting,1!,1!,1!,"In the US the answer is difficult for several reasons. First, many voters are complex people with emotions of loyalty to party, loyalty to the way family and friends have always voted. That loyalty is independent of the candidate.Many voters have loyalty to a set of issues and ideologies. Many voters have conflicted loyalty between party/friends and issues/ideology. Many voters have loyalty to inconsistent issues. They are Catholic pro-life at birth and pro-death-penalty. Or they are anti-welfare to big business and pro-ACA. Many voters have conflicted loyalty between issues. Pro-abortion voters and Pro-Second Amendment voters are the only voters who are clear in their single issue priorities.All of that influences most voters more than the qualities of the candidate.The question is about running leaders. It is the candidate who is running. So I assume the question is about the candidate and not the supporters of the candidate. I have often knocked on doors for a candidate. We door knockers say that when we get a person to vote who would not otherwise vote, or to switch candidates, then the voter is voting for us door knockers and not for the candidate.In a low turnout election with many door knockers the percentage that vote for the door knocker is the single biggest shiftable block of votes. A 7 precinct area voted 55% Democrat for president. Then I went door-to-door in a local election and it went 65% for the most conservative, anti-corruption slate in a 3–way slate between the slate of the corrupt Republican Governor and the slate of the far-left Teacher’s Union. The total vote was about the same as in the Presidential election. It was so due to my get-out-the-vote effort in an otherwise low-turnout election. My effort resulted in more votes for both the opposition and for my slate. But my slate got most of the benefit.Peter Fitzgerald ran against the corrupt Republican establishment. He spent big money on TV ads. Most of the ads were on issues and forgettable. But one TV ad was of his Hispanic looking Greek wife and his cute 5 year old kid. That one ad got him a large number of swing votes. But the Building Trades Unions and their friends supported Peter because he has stood with them when the bi-partisan money boys had tried to screw the union workers.So Peter won due to the picture of his Hispanic looking Greek wife and cute kid … the Union members going door-to-door outside the Republican Party. Each of those was probably close to 5%. But the race was closer because the corrupt Republicans, led by the corrupt governor, future Speaker of the House and the controller of all RNC money all supported the clueless Democrat.“I’m with her” obviously was the symbol of arrogance that many voted against. But it is difficult to measure that. The arrogance was so mixed with the anti-PC attitude, and the ideology loyalty presented by Wayne Allyn Root, and the GOTV of Ralph Reed, and the pro-Second Amendment issue that it is difficult to measure.

2,"Ireland will vote on the subject of abortion soon, SC voted and the Democrats voted against reducing the time for an abortion, who has the ability to change the attitude towards the practice and what is the solution?",Abortion,Voting,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,"Ireland will vote on the subject of abortion soon, SC voted and the Democrats voted against reducing the time for an abortion, who has the ability to change the attitude towards the practice and what is the solution?Outlawing abortion (or expanding access to it for that matter) won’t change anyone’s attitude. Peoples’ views on abortion are generally fixed, and while they can change somewhat over time, it’s unusual absent a religious conversion for someone to switch from pro-choice to pro-life or vice versa.What can change peoples’ attitudes is familiarity. Not that long ago in the U.S., the majority of people were opposed to same-sex marriage. Even liberal politicians like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are on record saying that marriage should be “between a man and a woman.” Whether they believed this at the time is irrelevant; the fact was that few politicians were willing to go against public sentiment on this issue.But attitudes changed very quickly, with several states legalizing same-sex marriage, starting with Massachusetts in 2004, and culminating in the Obergefell v. Hodges decision legalizing it nationwide in 2015. By that time, a majority of the American public was in favor of expanding marriage rights to same-sex couples, and only the most hard-core, far-right politicians expressed opposition to it. It’s virtually a non-issue today, with only silly disputes being played out, such as whether a bakery should be required to sell a wedding cake to a gay couple, or if they can refuse based on their “religious conviction” that homosexuality is a “sin.”What changed the popular opinion was, in my view, increased familiarity. The TV show “Will and Grace” has been credited with exposing more people to the idea that gays and lesbians aren’t that different from them. It’s easy to demonize LGBT if all you know about them is from coverage of the Christopher Street Parade, or your neighbor’s troubled kid who moved to San Francisco and died of AIDS. It’s much harder to maintain that same level of fear and hatred of “the other” when you have LGBT relatives and coworkers, and their portrayal in popular culture is more positive and inclusive.So what will change peoples’ attitudes about abortion isn’t legislation, but more women (and men) coming forward not just to support abortion rights, but to talk openly about how their own experience with abortion was positive and life-affirming. Around 28% of women in the U.S. have had abortions - this isn’t a trivial number. It’s likely that every American knows at least several women who have had abortions. Similar to LGBT, it’s easier to oppose abortion if you can demonize the women who have them as “selfish” or “irresponsible” or “sluts;” it’s much harder if you view them as real people - your friends, neighbors, co-workers, and family members who made a difficult but necessary decision.So the answer to “who has the ability to change attitudes toward abortion,” the answer is “we do.”",89,1,188,720,0,0

This is because most candidates, particularly in the out-of-power party, are campaigning against Washington. If the President comes and campaigns for a candidate that could send entirely the wrong message, up to and including that the candidate is the hand picked choice of the party insiders. A very recent example of this phenomenon is what happened to Luther Strange of Alabama in his primary contest for the U.S. Senate against Roy Moore. The perception, true or not, that Luther was Mitch McConnell’s hand-picked candidate was a major factor in his loss to Judge Moore.In short, in nearly all cases, in every election cycle, the party realizes it would be best for a former President not to campaign directly for Congressional and Senate Candidates.That does not mean he won’t be helping. I am sure the President will be attending fundraising events—mostly high priced events for deep-pocket donors. He may attend fundraisers for select candidates, but again, not open-to-the-public fundraisers in all likelihood.If the President does make any public appearances, it will be for a Senate candidate at that candidate’s request. Even in that case, either the President or the party may veto that idea based upon their their strategy or polling.The President may also attend a select number of state party conventions where he might deliver a speech to rouse the party.But in any case, if he does involve himself he won’t overdo it.

That’s utter nonsense. Even if they wanted it, and even if Congress wanted to grant it, it is still legally impossible for it to happen that way, for two main reasons:The US Constitution only gives Congress the power to create new states, not give them up.The US Constitution guarantees that all citizens in each and every state will not be deprived of all the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States. That means they cannot either force or allow California to secede, since that would either deprive millions of US citizens of their citizenship, or force them to move to a different state, which is also an unconstitutional breach of their rights.And then of course there is the human angle.

Right now the GOP only controls 32 state legislatures, and they may be about to lose two or three more in a matter of months.But alas, that is also unconstitutional without California’s affirmative consent.

1,Is the US destined to become a single party state? Will Hispanics and Asians always vote democrat?,Hispanic Ethnicity and People,Voting,1!,1!,1!,1!,"The US will most likely remain a two party state well into the future. As seen in America’s past, one party WILL and always does come out on top, effectively making it a faux ‘one party’ state, meaning one party is in control of all forms of legislature and government, but in this context, no, the US won’t just lose a party. Maybe one will have supermajority powers, ie, progressive era post Teddy Roosevelt. Just prior, when the republicans took control of nearly all forms of government post-civil war American history. Our bicameral legislature simply doesn’t allow a one party state to emerge. Free and fair elections dictate that although one party may be in power, public opinion shifts, and ousting other parties out of power, meaning Democrats and Republicans, is a totally normal procedure in American politics, as it is in most republics. However, government gridlock and both parties struggling for the bare minimum of power in government has become the norm, which can describe much of America’s political history. In modern day politics, meaning 1970’s onward, we haven’t seen ‘complete’ control from one party or another. Sure, we’ve seen majorities and pluralities, but we haven’t seen anything detrimental to a bicameral legislature. The only way this could happen is if it is ‘artificially’ forced from within the realm of government and authority. Leave it up to the voters, and no, it won’t happen.Now to answer the latter half of the question. Hispanics and Asians will not ‘always’ vote Democratic. With times change, voting patterns and behaviors change. Morals, ethics, values, ideology, it’s all fluid. Just like how the Democrats were once the party of the ‘peculiar institution’ but now trumpet affirmative action amongst other policy measures aimed at providing reparations for minority demographics, but that’s a whole other story.When the Republican Party changes their social policy views is when minorities will flock in droves to the GOP. ‘Socially liberal, fiscally conservative’.

Will Hispanics and Asians always vote democrat?Original Question Details: Permanent Democratic Majority: New Study Says YesThank you for the A2A, Marcus CorvinusUS Politics goes in multi-decade cycles.

Then from the Civil War to the Great Depression, the Republicans were in ascendancy. Then from FDR to Reagan, the Democrats were in ascendancy. Since Reagan, the Republicans have been in ascendancy.It looks like it may tip soon, but the exact date remains to be seen.Eventually, this new “permanent” Democratic majority will crumble and the Republicans will come back into ascendancy. It probably won’t look anything like today’s Republican party. Most of the White, Ethnonationalists will probably be dead by then.

I think they are mistaken. The best way to understand politics is to think of a party or a movement as a person.Progressives today remind me of a high school girlfriend: Emma Jean.She was, to use my son’s term: Binary.That is: She was in love/ not in love.From the first day we went out, she was in love with me.On a Tuesday (I remember because we had a game that night), about a month later, Emma Jean, woke up, switched her PJs for jeans and a top, and discovered she not in love with me.I was dumped in my first hour biology class.[As an aside, Emma Jean married, had three kids, and loving husband (from out of town). She also fought a nasty-ass war with cancer. The kind where “We got this beat” was followed again and again by “It’s back.”God did that suck.In any event, if you have ever seen somebody fight cancer long term when the end occurs there is a feeling of relief for the victim. The grieving has already been done.So, at Emma Jean’s wake, one of my classmates said, “Didn’t you date Emma Jean?”“For a month, Sophomore year.”“We’ve formed the Emma Jean Love Club. We’re meeting at the bar afterwards.”We told stories about dating her as we drank our beer.We laughed hard and cried hard, too.We still met at high school reunions and give her a toast.Here’s to you, Emma Jean.]Continuing along the same lines, the “mainstream” (I hate that term) Democratic Party has its share of blame.Half way through my senior year, the “love of my life” and “future wife” moved to Texas.Back then in my home town in that day and age, prom was a huge deal. Everybody went to prom. It was part of the social construct that even the most rebellious of us dare not defy.So, with prom rapidly approaching, I asked Chris to the prom.She smirked, “Why would I go with you?”I played my ace: “Who else you got?”[We had a pleasant time.}That is exactly how mainstream Democrats are treating progressives.Somehow, we as a party, need to learn to manage the disparate interest.",493,19,137,37,0,0

So I voted against Obama twice, and voted against Hillary once. My idealism sought to advocate for a left-leaning Democratic Party, and I felt that the best way to force the Democratic Party to the left was to have a Green Party doing the pulling. In order for the Green Party to be successful it needed to reach a 5% threshold. Living in a very blue state, I knew Hillary was likely to reach somewhere between 60–80% of the vote. A vote for the Green Party was not going to alter the landscape overmuch. If the Green Party succeeded—and 2016 was the year of years to do this with the two worst candidates in history running—the DNC would have had little choice but to see the political map shifting to the left (I did advocate for those living in purple states to vote for Hillary but I never foresaw Trump as having even a small possibility of winning.) Well, the Green Party failed hugely, as Trump would say. The map shifted, all right; waaaay over to the right.After the election, I can easily see my political thoughts as too complicated, too dependent on everyone working together, too…ridiculous.So no more Green Party for me. We still need to have something pulling the Democratic Party to the left, but another party is not going to do that. A progressive wing is the only way it will happen. So in the primaries I advocate for progressive candidates. If they do not win, I will vote for the Democrat in most elections (I doubt if I can stomach a vote for Cuomo in November). The Republican Party needs to be stopped. It is an affront to this country’s ideals, and to the world—the use of propaganda instead of science, the use of racist dog whistles, the xenophobia, the collaboration with the Religious Right…the stakes are very high. Right now I am very pessimistic that there can be a progressive shift in America. We are so far right in this country that someone like Obama can be viewed as communist by many voters in the Republican Party (he was pretty much a Bush-lite). There are glimmers of hope—the popularity of Sanders—but until a democratic-socialist wins on the the national level, those are just glimmers.

It is also very important that people trust and have confidence in these institutions to tell the truth otherwise problems can arise.Federalism: Just because some people vote for authoritarian leaders doesn’t mean everyone does or everyone support them.

Democracy is an idea which people can use, virtually, in any way they choose. There are no hard and fast rules laid down as to what defines a “democracy”. One of the assumed principles is that people should be allowed to vote. Another assumed principle is that the voters should be free of coercion in respect to who they vote for. There seems to be no rules about who and how people can nominate as candidates, exactly who might have the “right” to vote, or who controls the nomination process in selecting candidates. Likewise, there seems to be no rules for allowing a level playing field as far as the amount of money a candidate can spend in promoting themselves.So far, this relatively “modern” idea of “democracy” has proven a rather abject failure that has simply provided the means for the rich and powerful to establish the rule by oligarchies. Most “democracies” only allow the voters to vote for preselected candidates of political parties. Apparently, it is against “democratic” principles to deny any candidate the opportunity to stand if they meet whatever qualifications a Government, or a Constitution, might impose.So, how do you define a “non-democratic” candidate - is it someone who doesn’t like the way the pseudo “democratic” system is used and wants to change things, or is it someone who is determined to put their nation first?",75,1,33,135,0,0

Republicans claimed that if they controlled both the Presidency and The Congress, then the nation would be better. Truman offered to call Congress into special session challenging them to pass some proposed legislation. If the Congress passes it, he'd offer to sign. The Congress failed and Truman repeatedly called the Congress a “do nothing Congress”. Truman's attacks forced Dewey to defend the actions of the Congress.

39,"As of May 2018, are Democrats worried that they will lose the 2018 elections?",Democratic Party (US politics),Political Campaigns,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Some are, no doubt about it. A quick Quora search for “blue wave” or “Democratic wave” will turn up a flurry of questions like this one or this one, and if you’re like me—in that you occasionally like to put on the MSNBC talking heads as ambient noise while making dinner because it’s somewhat more tolerable than the range hood over the stove—you’ll likely also have noticed TV Democrats panicking as well. So yeah, some are worried. Terrified, even.Unduly so, according to any reading of the evidence. From the winter of 2017 through spring 2018 Democrats had become a little spoiled in recent months in terms of political indicators for November, with enormous special election overperformances in Alabama, Pennsylvania, and Arizona as well as a lead on the generic ballot that peaked at 12 percentage points in December. As it turns out, these were all fairly large deviations from a long-run average of about 7 percentage points.That’s the key phrase there: long-run average. Over the past year the average Democratic lead on the generic ballot has been in the range of 6–8 percentage points (depending on how you weight your polls), and starting in September 2017 typically large deviations from this average (by, say, more than one or two percentage points) haven’t lasted more than two weeks or so. (The longest the Democratic lead has been significantly higher or lower than 7 percentage points was a month from mid-December 2017 to mid-January 2018, but this happened just once.)That goes for whether the deviation is in the Democrats’ favor or the Republicans’ favor. So starting in about September 2017, whenever you saw a surge or sharp decline in Democratic fortunes on the generic ballot, you could usually just wait it out for about two weeks, after which it’d generally settle right back to around 7 percentage points.Probably no single pollster has been more sensitive to the most recent Republican surge in the generic ballot than Ipsos, which first recorded the most recent Democratic decline beginning April 24. It was also around this time that they started recording a large and sudden improvement in President Trump’s approval rating—in fact, it seems to me that their finding of a net approval rating close to zero was what first set off the latest round of talking-head-panic.The Democratic decline recorded by Ipsos was, to be fair, pretty dramatic. On April 24 Ipsos recorded an 11-point Democratic lead; within three weeks this lead, the second-largest recorded all year, had completely disappeared.It was simultaneously one of the sharpest shifts in generic ballot polling recorded by Ipsos and one of the most fleeting. The Republicans peaked at a five-point lead on May 19. It’s now a week later and the Democrats are back to a seven-point lead. (There’s that number again!)And given that even during presidential campaigns—the political event that ostensibly attracts the broadest amount of attention from the American public—voters don’t even really start thinking about their vote until after the summer’s over, you’ll find it hard to convince me that any sudden change in any political indicator during these midterms is actually important, unless that change persists for more than a month (or happens after the summer’s over).Finally, even by my reckoning the Democrats have a 46% chance of winning the House. Those chances have never been lower than 40% and were higher than 60% for just a couple weeks in late December. So I’m not actually saying that as a Democrat you have no right to panic over the November outlook—who am I to tell you that, anyway?—but I am saying that there’s no additional reason to panic compared to maybe a month ago or two months ago. Democratic chances are really about as good (or as bad) as they’ve ever been. A one-week fluctuation in the polls—especially at this relatively early stage in the cycle—doesn’t change that.50% CI: 205–231 Democratic seats. 90% CI: 190–258 Democratic seats.",3k,91,2.3k,"1,040",3,1

Unfortunately, even if Democrats get their act together, change strategies, etc. it is unlikely to impact the views of the 30%+ of our country who believe anything that comes out of Right-Wing media.Democrats tend to operate on the assumption that reason, truth and facts will persuade people. The power & sophistication of Right Wing media outlets over the past 25 years has dis-proven this. Today even highly intelligent and principled Republicans now no longer seem to question or fact-check anything that their favorite media personality says. For all practical purposes they are now Fact-Immune.Several former Right-Wing media personalities have spoken out about this:John Ziegler - nationally syndicated conservative talk show host & former Breitbart contributor.“We have reached the bizarro-world point where, for all intents and purposes, conservatives are RINOs [Republicans In Name Only]…. There is no place now for real conservatives. We've also reached the point, I say, we've left the gravitational pull of the rational Earth, where we are now in a situation where facts don't matter, truth doesn't matter, logic doesn't matter.“We have taught conservatives for many years to trust nothing other than what they hear in conservative media. Yet the conservative media has now proven to be untrustworthy.Edward Newton - Communications Adviser to the 2012 Romney-Ryan Campaign. Speaking about right-wing news outlets:“What it became, essentially, was they were preaching this is the only place you can get news. This is the only place you can trust. All other media outlets are lying to you. So you need to come to us. And so in an attempt to capture an audience, they almost made them slaves to those news outlets. So there is a whole group of people who will only watch Fox, who will only read Breitbart. And they are living in a bubble.Erick Erickson - described in The Atlantic (2015) as “the most powerful conservative in America” & worked as editor-in-chief of the popular conservative blog RedState for almost 10 years.“Conservatives have spent years calling out the mainstream media for making up stuff about the right. We do ourselves no favors if we do not also hold our own side accountable lest they discredit us all and drive our own side to the brink of dementia.Charlie Sykes - the most influential conservative talk show host in Wisconsin for over 20 years:“For a quarter of a century, I was a major part of the conservative movement. But like many on the right, in the wake of Donald Trump’s victory I had to ask some uncomfortable questions. The 2016 presidential campaign was a brutal, disillusioning slog, and there came a moment when I realized that conservatives had created an alternate reality bubble—one that I had helped shape.“During the 2016 election, conservatives turned on the principles that had once animated them. Somehow a movement based on real ideas—such as economic freedom and limited government—had devolved into a tribe that valued neither principle nor truth; luminaries such as Edmund Burke and William F. Buckley Jr. had been replaced by media clowns such as Ann Coulter and Milo Yiannopoulos. Icons such as Ronald Reagan—with his optimism and geniality—had been supplanted by the dark, erratic narcissism of Donald Trump.“If the conservative movement is defined by the nativist, authoritarian, post-truth culture of Trump and Bannon, I want no part of it….Despite the demands that conservatives obey the new regime, precisely the opposite is needed. Rather than conformity, conservatism needs dissidents, contrarians. It needs people who believe in things like liberty, free markets, limited government and personal responsibility—but who have no obligation to defend the indefensible or rely on alternative facts. It needs people who can affirm that Trump won the election fairly and freely but recognize the gravity of Russia’s interference in the campaign.(All quotes above come from a September 2017 Newsweek article which is well worth reading in its entirety (despite its ridiculous & provocative name): How the right lost its mind, sold its soul and embraced Donald Trump)Unfortunately, unless Democrats & Mainstream Media adopt the highly sophisticated propaganda techniques of Right-Wing Media (and let go of their dedication to facts, reason, and journalistic integrity) I fear the Republicans will continue to win votes, resulting in:The continued promotion of Doubt re: human-caused global warming - despite the overwhelming agreement by scientists the world over. This allows the continued pollution of the entire planet’s air, water and soil in favor of oil company profits and stockholder dividends. The poorest & most vulnerable in the world always suffer the most.Continued erosion of trust in anything or anyone serving as a checks-and-balances to the Trump administration (i.e. All of our Intelligence agencies, our Judicial System, Mainstream Media.)

39,"As of May 2018, are Democrats worried that they will lose the 2018 elections?",Democratic Party (US politics),Political Campaigns,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Some of them are pretty anxious because of the generic ballot and Trump’s approval ratings, so let’s look at those, from HuffPost Pollster’s database:I made the following adjustments: only include polling firms that have had more than 5 polls in the field. It’s actually remarkably stable. The above image is with the least smoothing. Let’s smooth it out:Now let’s look at Trump approval. For this, I’ve screened for pollsters with at least 7 polls in the field and I’ve applied the most smoothing to the trendline, since this is a more frequently asked question by far:So what do we see here? Remarkable stability on the generic ballot question - the Democrats have been 40–43% since May of 2017 and the Republicans from 36–39%.On Trump approval, there has been some improvement back to where he was in ~April of 2017.Truthfully, these numbers don’t give us much to go on. The best takeaway I can get is that we’re deeply polarized and the two sides are relatively evenly matched, and little that happens moves these numbers. The election will hinge on which side can generate more turnout. If they both generate a lot of turnout, then the House and Senate will remain close to evenly divided, but in whose favor, difficult to predict.Historically since we’ve tracked these numbers (going back to 1948) there have only been two midterms where the president’s party gained seats, and in those two, presidential approval was MUCH higher (Bill Clinton 60%+ in 1998, and George W. Bush 70%+ in 2002) It’s almost a given that Republicans will lose House seats.My personal predictions are: House - the environment alone will be at least a dozen House seats for the Democrats. The average mid-term loss for a president is -18 seats. I’ll be conservative and predict that Democrats will only likely gain 15, taking them to 210. Then there will be ~20 nailbiter districts that will decide control. Whoever wins the most out of those remainders will win. 218 is needed for control.Senate - it’s difficult because while the environment favors Democrats the arrangement of contested races favors Republicans. There are about 14 senate seats that are possible flips - 4 Republican held ones and 10 Democratic ones. The Democrats need to win 12 of those 14 to take control, the Republicans only need to hold 3 of those 14. In truth there are probably only going to be 7 toss-ups, 2 of them Republicans, 5 of them Democrats, of which the Democrats need to win 6 of 7. That’s a tall order.It is quite possible, though, since it’s rare for out-party incumbents to lose in a mid-term. Historically, only 7 out-party Senate incumbents have lost in a mid-term since 1982, and 4 of those 7 were either scandal-ridden or appointed due to death/resignation. The 3 “regular” losses for an out-party incumbent in a mid-term were in 1998 and 2002, and quite frankly featured unique circumstances: 1998 NC - Lauch Faircloth was caught unprepared, did not run a good campaign, so lost to John Edwards. 1998 NY - Mike D’Amato lost a nasty race to Chuck Schumer. 2002 GA - Max Cleland was blindsided by attacks on his patriotism so lost to Saxby Chambliss.So I give the Democrats a strong likelihood of taking 10 of those 14 elections. Even for their most vulnerable Trump-state Senators, I give them at worst 50/50 odds of losing. Therefore I think they will lose half their tightest races. In the end I think the Senate will remain the same or move to 50/50 with Pence retaining R control - Democrats will lose 1-2 of the 4 FL, IN, MO, ND, and gain 2 of the 3 NV, AZ, TN, resulting in 51/49 or 50/50.",954,30,4.2k,"2,173",3,0

A lot of the predictions of a “blue wave” were based on the generic ballot. In January that was at a plus 12% for Democrats. Mainly due to the good economy that has dropped to about 5%. That is a trend in the wrong direction if you are a Democrat. However, history shows that the party out of power always has a pick up of seats in the midterm election after a Presidential election. Since the Civil War, this has happened all but twice. Secondly, if you go back to President Obama’s first midterm election the generic ballot was at a .6% advantage for Democrats at this point in the process. That election turned into a “bloodbath” for Democrats as the Tea Party Republicans dominated. The fact is that most Americans do not pay any attention at all until the last few weeks before the election. Look at Scott Pruitt as the head of the E.P.A. . He currently has multiple scandals involving ethical violations and in a recent poll 60% of Americans had no idea who he is. November is far in the future.

2,What were the Democratic Party's policies before the late 1960s (around JFK's time and before) apart from race? Did the Party share JFK’s views?,John F. Kennedy (US President),Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,Based on my interpretation of what I have been exposed to (I wasn’t alive in the 1960s) the Democrats in general tended to be more statist (big government) and to an extant continue those views to this day. Remember the “New Deal” of the 1930s? That was a policy of Democrat President FDR. They also tended to be anti-Communist (JFK and FDR were no friends of Communism) less isolationist and more interventionist than the Republicans of the time. The Democrat party seems to have been more divided politically than the Republicans were so saying whether the party as whole shared JFK’s views or not is hard to say.,24,1,80,845,0,0
2,"Why did the government of Russia help the Republicans (not only in the presidential race, but in down ballot elections as well) and hurt the Democrats in the 2016 election?",2016 US Presidential Campaign and Election,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Because of their evaluation that the current Republican make up was more beneficial to their aims.They didn’t help Hawkish foreign policy Republicans. They didn’t help effective economic policy Republicans. They didn’t assist anyone plugged into the National Security Apparatus.They selected fire breathers running against Clintonian Democrats. They picked the isolationists and those that were more receptive to Dark Money influxes, especially those who wouldn’t ask where the money came from.They also selected fights that would trigger some regional turmoil in useful areas like South Florida and in and around New York City. Areas that an existing Russian presence already had footholds.Tea Party Republicanism is beneficial to Russia in their estimation. Less military adventurism, less foreign aid, less economic oversight and an increased focus on immigration, especially non-white immigration.They want more Russians coming over because if they can somewhat choose who comes over, they can build up their own domestic influence. Reducing immigration from Africa and Latin America is good for Russia.Russia has a contracting population. They have never recovered from the loss of 50 million citizens in the period of the World Wars. They need some immigrants of their own but also have a population that is motivated to exit because of economic opportunities. Sending Russians to America is viewed as good. They don’t attract many immigrants of their own though. This is complex because they don’t really want Muslims but they will take them when necessary and they aren’t really set up to take in migrants but they have a lot of empty space and little economic activity.Ultimately though, this is about money. The Oligarch’s Money. They want less sanctions and anyone they identify as being weak on sanctions is going to be considered for assistance.So this is not really a preference for Republicans. The Republican party is traditionally tougher on Russia and more inclined to utilize economic sanction as a geopolitical tool.

It appears that Putin is focused on rebuilding Russia’s power in the world:After Election Landslide, It's Putin's Russia (More Than Ever)At this time only two powers are in a position to continue to challenge Russia: the US and China, and the US has historically been the primary challenger. The EU is economically powerful but politically divided and relatively weak militarily.If we accept these premises, then anything which introduces turmoil in the US is in Russian interests. And as the answers below show, helping Trump garner the 77,000 votes need to turn Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania in the election has been very effective.Why Trump as opposed to Hillary, since technically being visible at supporting either would be sufficient to introduce turmoil? I suggest that Trump being a business man is of some explanatory power: he can be swayed by personal economic interest. Indeed china has leveraged that with the $500M investment in Trump’s Indonesian efforts:China Contributing $500 Million to Trump-Linked Project in Indonesia | National ReviewSo it seems that the primary driver was that Russia believed that Trump’s business based approach would make him easier than Hillary to work with.

1,Why is Congress or the Democrats preventing Trump from building the wall along our southern border?,Trump Border Wall Proposal,U.S. Congress,1!,1!,1!,1!,"First, I’d like to explain the difference between CONSERVATIVE and REPUBLICAN. Republican is a party. Anyone can belong. Many liberals, like McCain. There are 170+ Rinos in the Republican party. Rinos are Republican In Name Only. They have no other connection to the Republican party whatsoever. They’re espousing liberal ideals.The best way to understand what a conservative believes is to read the Declaration of Independence and the US Constitution.The best way to understand what a liberal believes is to read the communist manifesto.Then, there are the globalists. Globalists want a world government. They want to rule the world. The US stands in the way. The US Constitution stands in the way. If they can get enough aliens who hate America to invade America they can take over America and thus pave the way for their world government. Taking guns and religion from the people is part of that plan. Every mass murdering dictator ever first took guns and religion from the people.I tell you these things to help you understand why a Republican congress is opposing Trump’s wall. They are not all conservatives. There are many liberals in both parties, and many globalists as well. Liberals and globalists have joined together, which isn’t surprising. Many liberals are globalists also.The big difference between liberal and conservative is, one wants a giant government that owns everything and takes care of you. The other is for a small government ruled by the people. Each person is responsible for his own actions, and the government does not intervene unless and until someone breaks the law. Laws are made of, by, and for the people.The federal government was created to protect and serve the people. The people are king in America. The government, their servants. Securing the border is a large part of the federal government’s job. Having a strong military is also their job. Liberals want to shrink the military, open our borders, and disarm the people. Think of it. Disarming the innocent does not protect them from the violent. 100s of thousands of people, probably millions of people, attend gun shows every year, and no one gets shot. it’s not the guns.Mass shootings occur in gun-free zones, and liberals want more gun-free zones. It’s counter-productive. Their “solutions” do the opposite of what they pretend to do. They are designed to fail.Trump fixed our economy. Unemployment is ridiculously low. Wages are up. Taxes are down. The Korean war is finally over. Hostages have been released. ISIS leaders have been caught.

But for the sake of this debate, let’s assume we are all agreed on those two terms - broadly that ‘conservatives’ are more those who are inclined to stick with the status quo and if they agree to change, are keen to do so slowly and cautiously.‘Liberals’, on the other hand (and I shall now drop the irritating quote marks) as a rule regard themselves as progressives, keen to bring in changes which they feel are in some way necessary - socially, economically, morally etc.(NB We should be cautious to regard as intellectually liberal all parties which choose to include the word ‘liberal’ in their name. Many such parties, especially in the less democratic countries, are anything but and include the word in a cynical attempt to gain a little respectability.)I suggest that my definitions above pretty much answer you question without going into specific issues on which the two might disagree.Naturally, there are all kinds of folk who regard themselves or are regarded by others as either conservative or liberal. For many conservatives ‘liberal’ is almost a term of abuse - I was once, as a far younger man, described by my father (who described himself as a ‘right-wing radical, whatever that means) as ‘dangerously liberal’. Conversely, calling someone a ‘conservative’ is for many liberals, especially the more stupid among them, damning a man or women to hell.That is not to say I regard liberals (or conservatives) as stupid per se, just that both groups have a fair share of stupid people in their ranks, and usually the more stupid they are, the more doctrinaire they are, insisting that they are right and there can be no other view. Not me, I’m afraid.There might be more to be said, but I shall leave it at that and see what other responses you get and whether anyone is inclined to comment on what I have to say.",131,1,34,266,0,0
8,What causes the most debate between liberals and conservatives?,Understanding Politics in the United States of America,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"These are stereotypes mind you..Conservatives:Are only concerned with how much profit they have made.How others should behave on any topic or situation.That no one take my Guns!Should as have as little Government as possible.Should not have to pay taxes.Everyone should believe as they do.Climate Change is a hoax. Pollution doesn’t harm people.Should abolish Dept Education, EPA, IRS, Dep HUD.Might makes Right. Have a Strong Military.There is no equality of the Sexes. Man is on top.Liberals:Climate Change is Real.Everybody should have equal rights (Race, Gender, Sexual Orientation).Free Education.Free Healthcare.Everyone should their “Fair Share” of Taxes according to their level of Income.Believe in 2nd Amendment, yet only have minimum restrictions to protect public (background checks, mental health).Should help other countries when possible.Business should not pollute the environment, recycle when possible.Everyone should go Green in terms of energy, waste and consumption.Education an Religion are separate an should intermingle. Dept Education should properly monitor how people learn.Not everyone in either category fit these stereotypes if they believe they are in that one, though both categories have these flavours for the most part. These are extremes, in opposite directions. Thing of a line with each category at one end. Then most people will somewhere between the ends.For myself, on most topics I’m in the middle. Not undecided, just ambivalent. I do believe in Climate Change. I’m fiscally more conservative. For example I believe, governments should fund themselves. Not run deficits year over year. Not have unpayable debt. Originally the Founders didn’t think would occur because they expected that responsibile people would be elected. Now it is clear we need an Amendment to the Constitution to enforce fiscal responsibility. The Budget should balance. If a deficit then a plan to nullify before more expenditures. Government should not interfere with who people marry, etc. There should be protection in workplace on Sexual Orientation as disabilities. Just as example.",95,2,3,88,0,0

And that is only the first absurdity in what you just said!”But then what happens is that the conservative opens their mouth again, and instead of improving in any way whatsoever they just spout new absurdities at the same rapid rate.And the liberal, who is all about education, of course tries helplessly to address at least the worst of these.

Put together with the Cohen account, to me it’s beginning to look like this is how trump pays people - by suggesting illegal activity whereby they can make money. Manafort was not paid for being the campaign manager. The lying charges for the others were plea bargains. The more serious charges were all dropped in return for testimony against Trump. We don’t know if and what the charges against Trump will be; we do know that Trump himself is being actively investigated.We do hear bits and pieces peripherally.

1,Are Republicans more patriotic than Democrats?,Political Liberalism Vs. Political Conservatism,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"This is what comes up when I Google the definition of a patriot:[a person who vigorously supports their country and is prepared to defend it against enemies or detractors.]Here’s a video of a patriot (hint: he’s the one shouting):We don’t know the party affiliation of the patriot in the video, but we do know that the target of his anger, Paul Manafort, is a Republican and not a patriot. All Republicans can’t be painted with a broad brush, but anyone supporting a president who:Dismisses U.S. intelligence agency warnings that Russia interfered in our elections and will continue to do soMakes zero effort to prevent future election meddlingFires the head of the FBI because he won’t stop investigating U.S. citizens (aka: traitors) who may be involved in the meddlingBrags about firing the FBI Director to Russian officials in the oval office at a meeting where the U.S. press was banned and the Russian press allowed in and reveals classified information to them that may endanger the lives of U.S. intelligence assets [1]Dismisses U.S. intelligence concerns about Chinese electronics manufacturer ZTE being an agent of the state because the Chinese helped him with a hotel deal [2]cannot call themselves a patriot. A patriot would loudly oppose a president who did all of those things, like the guy in the video above. At this particular point in history Democrats have the upper hand when it comes to being patriotic, being nearly unanimously opposed to a president who may be selling us out to a foreign power or two. Republicans have to make the decision to put country over party (patriot) or not (non-patriot). Here’s what the former looks like in spirit:Unfortunately, Jeff Flake has thrown in the towel on running for re-election and will probably be replaced by a non-patriot. These are some additional Republican patriots who’ve demonstrated they believe in putting country before party:Jim ComeyRod RosensteinRobert MuellerJohn McCainRichard BurrWhen it comes to patriotism, there is no Team Democrat or Team Republican, there is only Team U.S.A.[1] Trump revealed highly classified information to Russian foreign minister and ambassador[2] Did Trump Vow to Help a Chinese Phone Maker After China Approved Money for a Trump Project?",281,6,121,353,0,4
1,Are Republicans more patriotic than Democrats?,Political Liberalism Vs. Political Conservatism,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"If patriotism is measured in the amount of lives wasted fighting overseas wars, both political parties are extremely patriotic! Barack Obama dropped more bombs than any other president in history. Take that Nobel Peace Prize Committee! Obama had to prove that he was just as patriotic as President Bush.Not to be outdone, Trump threatens to wipe out North Korea, send troops to fight bush wars in Africa, and launches missiles into Syria in a hopeless attempt to figure out which side in the Syrian War is the good guys. Looks like another Nobel Peace Prize for America!Presidents Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon were all convinced that they could win the Vietnam War. 50,000 troops later, we left Vietnam, but we did it only after killing millions of the enemy. So we didn't lose. Yeah us!Trump and the NFL want to fine/imprison NFL players who kneel instead of stand for the national anthem. There’s nothing more patriotic than flag shaming someone who chooses to protest police brutality. These rich black athletes hate America so much, they can go join the Amish or a tribe of Native Americans. Two groups of poor people who’s lack of patriotism ensures their own poverty. Manifest Destiny!A true test of a patriot is claiming that America is the most free nation, yet has the largest prison population. Marijuana is not native to America, so it’s not a patriotic plant like tobacco or Jimsonweed. It’s your patriotic duty to jail your neighbors for smoking the wrong plant. Reefer Badness!It’s important that we limit the number of people who get to enjoy our American liberties. If we let in too many people, we won’t feel special about being an American. Patriotism is kicking out as many people from America as possible. Not just the United States. We need to deport them from the entire North American Hemisphere. #PoliceState.The ultimate test of patriotism is debt. Nobody racks up national debt like America. Low Energy Greece only spent 120 percent of GDP on government services before they went bankrupt. Patriotic America will spend 250 percent of GDP on entitlement spending, a ridiculously large military, and a whole bunch of other things that probably weren’t needed. If the rest of the world doesn’t bankroll our extreme spending habits, we’ll blow them up! #Patriotism.Based on these observations, it’s a tie. Both Republicans and Democrats are extremely patriotic and love big government.",140,0,33,57,0,0
1,Are Republicans more patriotic than Democrats?,Political Liberalism Vs. Political Conservatism,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"No, modern republicans just conflate unrelated things that are highly relevant to their interests, with patriotism. Nationalism, for example, gun ownership, or a highly filtered, whitewashed idea of Christianity. None of these things = patriotism.

1,Are Republicans more patriotic than Democrats?,Political Liberalism Vs. Political Conservatism,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Conservatives are more pro-borders (not just national borders but in keeping traditional clasifications, separations, etc.).Basically, conservatives are slow to change (averse to risk) and want to trust in what worked well in the past. Liberals are much more open to change and to try something new, even if as yet unproven.FDR was a great example of this liberalism with all the programs he tried (trial and error) during the Great Depression. Nearly all were a failure but he said doing something is better than doing nothing. He racked up an enormous national debt as well.But if we say that protecting our borders and keep being very caution on who we allow into the country is a part of “patriotic”, then yes, conservatives think that way a bit more than liberals.Plus we have this recent study showing “pride” in America is lower amongst liberals, on average:Sharply Fewer Democrats Say They Are Proud to Be Americans",14,0,48,"1,369",0,1
1,Are Republicans more patriotic than Democrats?,Political Liberalism Vs. Political Conservatism,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Lots of left wing opinions which are sympathetic to the Democrats here, but keep in mind that each political group is prone to defending itself first and foremost.I believe Democrats are, on average, less patriotic. I say this with almost two decades of heavy debating with the left to try to understand their positions and find common ground where possible. On this issue they’re wrong if they tell you there isn’t a stronger anti-American mentality on the left generally speaking, and leftist are more commonly within the Democratic party, the Dems have taken a sharp turn recently.Some of the members here are trying to make this about policy, or saying that the definition of patriotism is subjective. While those things are worth a mention, let’s be realistic here, the Democrats are doing things that Republicans aren’t. One of the most important factors to whether or not a person is a patriot is whether or not they’re proud of their country and the left is proud of this country FAR less often. How do I know this?Nobody should have blind patriotism but leftist take things to such an extreme, they more commonly do things like burn the American flag, kneel during the National Anthem, voice outright hate for our country, and violently protest when an election doesn’t go their way. That’s hard not to see so I’m surprised at some of the answers here.I’ve spoken with leftist who have tried to equate soldiers (who aren’t committing war crimes) with terrorist, suggested that our nation is founded in racism when it’s more complicated than that, it was founded on a lot of things including ingenuity, compassion, and cooperation. Racism is an unfortunate part of our history and even our current culture so it should be debated, having said that it doesn’t define our country. America has strengths and weaknesses and leftist are more commonly laser focused on the negative.Leftist more commonly criticize those who express appreciation for our nation as well by going to the argument of American exceptionalism being blind. Personally I haven’t ever stated America is the best at everything yet still had fellow debaters go to that argument.I spoken to a modern liberal who didn’t like Independence Day because he was associating it with the right. In his view, Independence Day is a holiday for overly patriotic Americans. I told him that….“independence day isn’t a liberal or conservative holiday, it’s an American holiday”But the debate went nowhere, he didn’t seem to grasp that concept because like many leftist, he was diproptionaly focused on the history of racism and everything else that makes us flawed. (I can provide links if necessary)Having witnessed all of this, no I don’t think Democrats or leftist are as patriotic as other major political groups because the evidence is overwhelming. Pay close attention to where their focus usually is and you’ll see it.",46,1,3,52,0,0
1,Are Republicans more patriotic than Democrats?,Political Liberalism Vs. Political Conservatism,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Some Republicans definitely believe that they are more patriotic than Democrats. As to whether they are, that depends on how one defines patriotism. Conservatives claim to value liberty, but for some of them liberty means the right to choose to conform to their standards. For other conservatives, liberty means the right not to conform if that’s your choice. The GOP includes both attitudes.The debate over whether NFL players ought to be obliged to stand for the anthem is a snapshot of the issue. For a segment of the GOP, outward displays of patriotism matter a very great deal. It’s never okay to this group of Republicans for other Americans to show their dissent in ways that make this group of Republicans unhappy. For them, freedom of expression is subordinate to loyalty to the nation. Another group of Republicans see protest as a fundamental part of good citizenship. Authoritarian regimes demand full participation in ritual displays of patriotism, and the Republicans who value protest want no part of coerced patriotism.So whether Republicans are more patriotic or not depends on how your values are prioritized. If patriotism means conformity over freedom of expression, then the Republicans who demand that athletes stand are very much living up to their definition of patriotism. If patriotism means speaking out against injustice over not making waves, then the Democrats tend to show more patriotism. It’s all down to the definition of patriotism.",53,1,15,384,0,0

1,How does the current Republican Party compare to traditional conservatism?,Paul Ryan (politician),Political Conservatism,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Used to be, if you were educated and higher-income, you were Republican, and vice-versa if you were a Democrat. Now, the opposite is becoming true. I’m a law-and-order, by-the-book conservative, not a tear-down-society-and-overthrow-the-government “conservative.” I’m conservative about being conservative. Remember how Richard Nixon created the EPA, signed the Endangered Species Act and signed the Family Planning Act (Title X - Wikipedia)? Yeah, most people don’t remember that either, but I’m glad he did. And check out the Republican Party Platform of 1956. Awesomeness.Once Tea Party nutcases started taking control of the GOP in the early aughts, it was downhill from there. For a while, the GOP was increasingly under the control of ideologues dedicated to tearing down traditional institutions (public education, the Constitutional right to an abortion, the social safety net. etc.). But the Tea Party turned a lot of people off - people just wanted to hate and be bigoted and the Tea Party gave them that - but the Tea Party also wanted them to listen to an hour lecture about obscure Constitutional theory.Then Trump came along and let people have all the hate with none of the egghead homework. He goes straight to the dessert without the vegetables, so to speak, and people love it. Even though Trump was a lifelong Democrat and donated to the Clinton Foundation, all was forgiven. Many Tea Partiers opposed Trump, because he took advantage of many of the big-government programs the Tea Party opposes and he lacks the ideological and intellectual foundation of the Tea Party. Hell, Trump lacks any ideological or intellectual foundation.Mainstream Republicans are becoming fewer in number, as ideologues and nihilists take over the party. Does that answer your question?I know no one likes talking about Democrats (especially Democrats), given the delicious distraction of Trump, but consider that over the past 20 years, the Democratic Party has shifted as far to the right, proportionately, as the GOP. Liberals really don’t have any party to represent them and that, also, is bad for our nation.",2.4k,61,247,224,0,2

Reagan stuck a knife in it, Gingrich used an axe to chop it into pieces. Trump, Ryan, and McConnell stomped on them. They’re partisan hacks. No other senate majority leader said, when elevated to that position, My priory is to see that this president serves only one term. Here was the US in several wars and fighting terrorists and recovering from the worst recession since the Great Depression, and that was Mcconnell’s priority.Nothing about working together for the good of the country, huh Mitch?

2,"What will the Democratic Party do if they fail to realize their ""blue wave"" in the midterms?",Progressive Blue Wave,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"If it happens, it happens. It’s a little soon to tell. Reliable metrics page them within 3–5 points ahead nationally in support and approval. Even the very biased Rasmussen poll currently has them ahead by a point.If they lose it, they have themselves to blame. They’ve shut out the young and the new movements sweeping through the party and that’s going to hurt them in the long run.Right now, the best the Democrats can hope for is happening: President Trump saying and doing highly ill-advised actions.What’s far more interesting is the fact that several moderate Republicans are bucking party leadership and acting against the party line.And rightly so-it’s hardliners that are in charge of the GOP right now and that’s getting toxic, fast to many Americans who are seeing the progress they fought for halted and starting to fall back.I would be aware that Newt Gringritch is a Republican. He is going to send hope to those who follow him, so they vote for him. Right now, he is pandering to Trump supporters and I’m really disappointed.He has become what he would have hated twenty years ago. He has sold his soul to this current administration for lucre.

They will likely chose the latter.Have you noticed that all they say about their opponents seems to happen to them? Projection perhaps? They made a choice, a choice to abandon anypretense of being for the “little man” and have gone hard core leftist (socialist/communist) and grouping people by the color of their skin instead of by the power of their ideas.People, believe it or not, are smarter than that. Their ideas are dieing which is exactly what should happen in a free society. Listen to a JFK speech and you’ll learn what the party once stood for.The dangerous part is what their abused and misinformed supporters might do…..violence against their opponents. That is the last refuge of those without an argument. We saw it with ANTIFA and the so called “resistance”.

Voting and taxes would be revamped to the individual level. Each individual could vote independently on their stance in every issue without voting for a candidate. Each individual that wanted to support social programs could and each that wanted not to wouldn't be forced. The judicial structure would be revamped. Jail time and prison would be educational. Inmates would be required to earn a bachelor's degree and physically work in farming programs to grow crops. Prisons would be self sustaining. Primary focuses would be in education, physical well being, and mental/ emotional well being of all. Charitable work could be done by people with a negative record to wipe it clean.

A country made by intellectuals and rebels who founded America based on the concept of individual rights and the idea that government exists only to protect those rights of equality, of life, of liberty, and the right to pursue happiness, among others.Since then t America started out as the most liberal country in the history of the world. A country made by intellectuals and rebels who founded America based on individual rights and the idea that government exists only to protect those rights of equality, of life, of liberty, and the right to pursue happiness.Since then there has been a complete war on liberalism… And if you look at the McCarthy hearings, the witchhunt of Clinton, and the current climate in America of anti-liberalism, it becomes shocking how we have become a culture of intolerance, hatred, and hostile to freedom, individual fart, independent thinking… And return to a level of fundamentalism that could only be embraced by the farthest right wing of a fascist world. .The Christian religion in America has become the party of hatred and intolerance… Cheering on capital punishment, gun possession, intolerance and even hatred for gays and lesbians, destroying the rights of women… The most unchristian people I have ever seen in my life. And they are embraced by the Republicans who have sold their soul to get power.What would happen if liberals came back into existence in America? We would have equality, our society would be seeking ways to find equality for everyone – equal justice under the law, equal rights, equal opportunity of education and career… Nondiscrimination… We would have a country where women got equal pay for equal work, and nobody could be fired or denied a hotel room or denied rental because they are gay or lesbian or a transsexual or black or Latino or Asian…People would make a livable wage – that is to say the minimum wage would be a livable wage. Laborers would have the right of arbitration, and the right to safe working conditions, collective bargaining, and non-arbitration – the right to sue when their civil rights and human rights are being abused.Healthcare would be considered a civil right, and all people would have access to healthcare the way they have it in so many of the civilized countries of the world.Focus and emphasis will be put on education for everyone, to allow for social mobility and for people to be able to pursue their rights given by God.Compassion would be a part of our national policy, in order to help people who are disadvantaged to live up to their potential. Yes… Maybe there would be food stamps and housing and job training to help people who are disadvantaged to achieve the American dream.Money might be put towards education and infrastructure it is now being used to prop up The US military. But we might be thinking in terms of this: America currently spends more money on the military then the next 10 countries put together – that’s Russia, China, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Syria, France, the UK, Jordan, etc.… We wouldn’t be pushing the endless propaganda that we don’t have enough strength in the world. And we wouldn’t be the number one arms seller in the world – selling military grade equipment to impoverished countries and propagating mass murder on the in Norma’s scale that we’re doing it today.If liberals were in power, we would seek to make treaties with the world that respected our allies , and tried to persuade our enemies through diplomacy and treaties.We would focus on the rights of all Americans from birth to death… The right to a safe living conditions, the right to a great education, great healthcare, great opportunities in employment, and senior citizens rights and safety.We would also make it legal for the Center for disease control to study gun violence, in order to prevent deaths and create safety and schools for our children.We would focus on higher education, and on providing job skill training for people who aren’t best suited to higher education. We would focus on global peace and disarmament. The getting rid of nuclear weapons, and the removal of the power of the president to be the sole person to be able to inflict the death of billions.And so much more.

3,What would happen if everyone in America became far left leaning politically?,Left-Wing Politics,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"Another wired “what if” question.But let’s face it - the USA is as far right as a democracy can be (and probably it is already too right - especially with the current administration). That means, even if someone has rather reasonable views of a government which “serves” society (as it meant to be), people will call this person socialist or even communist (which isn’t the same!).Hence the question really make no sense.“Far left” is also not really defined in the question: is it far left in an American context (which isn’t that much left - in comparison of European countries, this would be rather center-left) - is it far-left in an international context, compared to democracies or far-left in an international context, but based on any government form (this would be communist).Communist is also not equal communist - the world never seen a functioning (and to its core idealistic) communism; hence it makes everything even more complicated.What we could assume, what would happen, if majority of US citizens would become more progressive.And this would probably happen:The military budget would be decreased dramatically.Education, welfare, social programs, social insurances would thrive.Multinational companies and the super rich, would pay more taxes.While the first change, would be not easy for Fortune 500 companies, the chances are, that business would thrive dramatically. Especially the middle class would thrive - and new small businesses would raise.The US would gain far more respect by other countries - with probably would increase their business with the US.A more social foreign policy would focus more on humanitarian aids - which would most probably defuse a lot of crisis areas (especially on the long run).In a longer run, the US would become even farther world leader - as their advanced education system (which would be “free”) would “produce” the intellectual elite of tomorrow.Sounds like a pipe dream? Only because the right have their heads in their asses- and stop social development where ever they can. Progress is mostly hindered by egoism, “money” and bigoted people.

In this answer I will make the case that Democrats are not libertarian on social issues.Libertarians and Democrats tend to be at the same side at the beginning. It’s when the initial goal has been achieved that they diverge.For example, it is not enough for gay people to marry. For a Democrat:They must marry according to definitions set by the government.Others must serve them.We both want drugs to be legal, but they want to tax and regulate drugs whereas we think people should be able to ingest anything into their own bodies without paying a fee to their rulers.We want to end legally enforced discrimination. But, once that has been achieved, Democrats will find anything they can pass off as discrimination and ban it.We both agree that government should not legislate morality. Christians who are opposed to premarital sex should not force their views on everyone else. Once this is achieved, Democrats want to enforce equality, and (paradoxically) diversity.Ultimately Republicans and Democrats are both willing to throw liberty under the bus at the first sign of dissent. They don’t give a damn about social or economic freedom. For them, humans are chess pieces that can be sacrificed for “the greater good”, not autonomous beings.Footnotes[1] Sayed Hajaj's answer to Libertarians, why are you not a Republican?",1.6k,93,370,521,0,0
12,"Libertarians, why are you not a Democrat?",Libertarianism in the United States of America,Libertarians,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Although I am not a Democrat, I nearly always vote Democrat as the lesser of evils, especially in close elections. What I value most in my political philosophy is individual liberty and civil rights, the classical liberal tradition on which our Constitution was founded: bodily sovereignty, self-ownership, freedom of expression (including the right to protest against the government), freedom of association (including whom we may marry), freedom of (and from!) religion, and equal opportunity to participate in a free market on a level playing field. I find that the Democratic Party shares my socially liberal values much more so than the GOP.The main reason I am not a Democrat is because I’m not a fan of the Nanny State. Democrats support laws to protect me from myself and I don’t need a baby sitter. I don’t want medical procedures, drugs, dietary restrictions, or safety devices inflicted on me “for my own good.” If the Democrats had their way we would probably all be required to wear padded gear and helmets in our own homes, as statistics show that most accidents happen in the home.The Democratic obsession with “safety” and a sincere desire to protect the public has also made them easy prey for lobbyists pushing for more and more regulation, ostensibly to benefit consumers, but in fact to protect the profits of established professionals against competition by restricting entry into their respective fields. While I share the Democratic position that some regulation of banking and industry is a proper function of government in order to protect consumers and employees from force and fraud, they really need to give small businesses and entrepreneurs a break.Speaking of which: taxes. Something that really irks me about my Democratic friends is that nearly all of them treat taxation as a Sacred Cow which must not be questioned or challenged under any circumstances. As an independent contractor/ small business owner who fell right through the alleged “social safety net” due to chronic illness, having managed to claw my way up out of poverty into the just-barely-middle class, when I tell them I am literally being taxed to death, they don’t seem to believe me. When I say that my taxes are too high, I am accused of being selfish and not caring about the poor. Hello, I was the poor until just fairly recently, and now I’m being punished for [barely] escaping from poverty!Having said that, as long as my hard-earned income is going to be extorted anyway, I’d rather see it spent on healthcare, education, libraries, helping the poor and other Democrat supported programs, as opposed to the GOP agenda of ramping up the War on Drugs, keeping more people in prison, corporate welfare and ill advised military actions overseas.But, where I differ with Democrats, and this goes back to the Nanny State, is that they seem to want government to do everything. They can’t conceive of a way to get anything good accomplished aside from instituting more government programs, paperwork and regulations, and robbing the working people in order to pay for it.",369,23,222,558,0,0
12,"Libertarians, why are you not a Democrat?",Libertarianism in the United States of America,Libertarians,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Because democrats are just as authoritarian (if not more) as Republicans. Heres my basic view on all the key issues1: immigrationI believe in secure borders and a robust system for handling and processing immigrants in a way that allows us to run detailed background checks and psych evaluations on prospective citizens. It should be hard to get here illegally, but i have nothing against those who want a better life here and are willing to go through the process.2: GunsI believe in the fundamental truth that every human being has the right to their own life, and should be ABLE to respond to any threat to their lives with proportionate force. It is imperitive to the preservation of freedom that citizens be able to match whatever level of force an enemy can bring to bear against them, within reason of course. This means, that since there are tens of millions of semi-automatic rifles already in the US, I should be able to have one in order to appropriately respond, should my life be threatened. I respect peoples opinions if they choose not to have firearms, but you cant tell me what I can and can't defend my life, liberty, and property with.3: EconomyIt is self evident that capitalism has generated the greatest technological and economical advances the world has ever seen. Innovation hurtles out of control. More people are being lifted out of extreme poverty than in the history of mankind. The united states provides billions of dollars in starvation relief every year. I believe that capitalism is the best economic system that mankind has created so far. Sure, we have inequality, but that doesnt equate to unfairness or coruption. Inequality is a natural phenomenon, and we try to mitigate it, but socialism is not the way.4: Drugsdecriminalize possession. Tax the shit out of it. Capitalism.5: AbortionThis is where I could swing either way. On one hand, I really dont care, on the other, I dont think that the government should subsidize it by funding planned parenthood.6: TaxesFlat rate income percentage tax. If you make 30,000, you should pay 10%, and if you make 3,000,000 you should pay 10%. Democrats wanting to tax rich people higher isnt out of love for the lower class, its out of hate for the upper class, and that is tge lowest, most pitiful excuse for policy I have ever heard of.7: foreign policyI went through three stages growing up. First, I thought “we should just nuke that entire section of the world”, then i thought “we should just pull completely out of everything and focus on ourselves” and now i think that there are certain places that the US needs to be involved in. Israel, for example. All of you anti-Semites can fuck yourselves. I'm not Christian, or Jewish, or religious in general, but I do know a thing or two about history. And yhe entirity of western civilization is based off of the judeo-Christian ideology of the individual being sovereign. I also know about the millenia of tragedies that have befallen the jewish people. We cant give up on israel. To do so would be to turn our backs on our history, and on a people that has to fight every day since its conception to stay alive. I also believe that as long as there are countries in which women aren't allowed to read, or while men find it socially acceptable to fuck little boys and blow people up, that the job is not done.8: political correctness/collectivism/identity politicsHonestly I believe that anyone who believes in any of these things needs to leave America. These concepts go against the very priciples on which it was founded, they shut down any room for rational debate, and it drives a wedge further between two deeply divided political parties.IN CONCLUSIONNo, I am not a Democrat, im not even a classical liberal. I believe in freedom, capitalism, and hard work, and from what I've seen, democrats distance themselves every day from these principles. That is why i don't vote Democrat.",2.1k,61,30,87,0,0

I started moving away from the Democratic Party when I started reading about the effects of subsidies. So at first it was economic issues that started nudging me away. But then I came across the nonaggression principle, which is the opposition to the initiation or the threat of initiation of the use of force against others. From this follows most of what most people seem to believe libertarianism is all about, including small (or even no) government. Libertarianism, or at least the version I subscribe to, is ultimately a stance against violence, including the threat to use violence. Since all laws, regulations, and so forth that come from government must, to have any teeth, be backed up by the threat of force for noncompliance, and since Democrats embrace the use of legislation to force people to act or not act in a certain way, I had to decide what was more important to me, and I decided that a peaceful society was more important than party affiliation.

This is not even vaguely acceptable to me. While the philosophical schism originated with Rousseau, it was deepened and elaborated by many other collectivist thinkers operating in Europe, most notably the Frankfurt school. Rousseau’s children ultimately advocate a worldview that is literally alien to our American character and philosophical basis.The Democratic party has embraced this alien ideology with full throat and whole heart. It has been entirely infiltrated and suborned by formal and informal agencies of the collectivist Left, and operates in a manner that is fundamentally incompatible with our founding norms and a society of free humans.Nothing is about the same hot button issues that have been misframed and argued in the Agora for the last 80 years.It’s about the very soul of America, the future of Liberty, and the individual dignity of free humanity, none of which is compatible with Rousseau and his spawn.To whit: The Democratic Party must be destroyed.Starter Bibliography:(See Charles Tips many fine answers regarding progressivist infiltration here on Quora: Charles Tips )The True Believer: Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements (Perennial Classics): Eric Hoffer: 0783324863185: Amazon.com: BooksAmazon.com: They Thought They Were Free: The Germans, 1933-45 (9780226511924): Milton Mayer: Bookshttps://www.amazon.com/Dupes-Americas-Adversaries-Manipulated-Progressives/dp/1610171462/Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Change: Jonah Goldberg: 9780767917186: Amazon.com: Bookshttps://www.amazon.com/Devils-Pleasure-Palace-Critical-Subversion/dp/1594039275/",534,26,261,"1,652",0,5

Assuming that the GOP gets about 1/2 of the overall vote, and that his base votes overwhelmingly Republican, it is clear that his base, while not a majority for the country as a whole, certainly constitutes a majority (or close to one) within the Republican Party.Also, his base is fanatically loyal to him. They will wait for hours to watch him pass by, sit through his interminable rallies, wave signs and, well, actually go to trouble of voting. When he boasted that he could shoot a man in the middle of 5th. Avenue and not lose any votes, it wasn’t that much of an exaggeration. Finally, for a multitude of reasons, Fox News is in the tank for him, which is what his base relies upon to get their alternative facts. So any criticism of him that actually gets through to his base is watered down and usually dismissed outright as “fake news”.As a result, Trump has a great deal of control within the GOP. Moderate Republicans are now under threat of losing GOP primary races to candidates that mirror Trump’s message, antics, or both. And even those who aren’t being challenged within their party must be careful not to upset Trump’s base, lest those Republicans stay at home on Election Day. So these “moderates” have to walk a tightrope - throw just enough red meat to keep Trump’s base happy without crossing the line and alienating non-Trump Republicans and/or incensing Democrats so much that they become super-engaged.For a Republican member of Congress, criticizing Trump is close to political suicide, which is why the vast majority of Republicans who have done so are ones who are on their way out already.Also, with Trump, the GOP have their majority. Which means that they get to pass the legislation they want, like their massive tax breaks for the wealthy constituents that paid to get them in office in the first place.

Moderate Republicans, in elected office, are getting scarce while moderate Democrats can still get elected.The Democrats are funnier but only sort of. The liberal comedians are funnier but only a few are vocally Democrats.The funniest guy on Capitol Hill though is probably Lindsay Graham and he’s super Conservative.Satire has become a liberal weapon but once, Rush Limbaugh was actually good at satire but his time in the echo chamber morphed that skill into meanness.The difference that matters is the lingering effect of Jon Stewart who was actually more effective at lambasting liberals than conservatives. His influence is quite strong right now with all of his disciples having matured into very public vehicles of their own. Each still almost relishes the opportunity to blister the liberal elite between harpooning the low hanging fruit that modern Conservatism occasionally provides.The heavily targeted audiences is very much a part of the problem. Demography in modern media has become heavily compartmentalized but this is really the result of the huge array of options struggling to achieve any audience at all.Alex Jones was always considered a kook but he has millions of listeners/viewers, he has a platform and it’s because he plays fast and loose with facts and was largely disregarded for years.Tomi Lahren is actually a good example. She’s young, white and Privaledgeed and is famous for her angry rants online. She has no conventional media platform but reaches millions. Millions of self selected people who like her angry rants, even when they are full of holes ideologically. She is seldom actually challenged, which is the point.Jon Stewart though liked the challenge and his willingness to accept that made him better but also attracted the most competent voices from the other side.Today’s voices don’t like the exchange of ideas and they don’t like the challenge. This is bad because it dumbs everything down.Ben Shapiro is a smart guy but his interactive skill set is tailored to end a discussion and then pronounce a victory, even though he has not moved the other person one centimeter.This happens on the Left because they have adopted the successful mechanisms of the Right.We saw this before with the Clintons who were exceptional at using Republican Campaign Tactics and organizational structures to enforce doctrine. This had a deleterious effect on the Democratic Party.That said, telling jokes is cathartic.

You don’t even hear Bill Maher argue that school shootings in Republican districts (which seems to be where they happen) are good strategic planning.Sheer meaness isn’t funny.Humor is a good way of taking the edge off of a difficult subject. It’s also a convenient way to not zone out on drawn out aggravating subjects, like Donald Trump saying that NFL anthem protestors shouldn’t be in America. Even though he has been shooting his mouth off for decades and is frequently dead wrong and hasn’t been escorted out of the country, yet.Humor is rooted most often in common sense and satire is rooted in hypocrisy.

If n% of the electorate support a particular party, then that party will get around n% of the seats. There is sometimes a minimum threshold that may discourage voting for very small parties but in general, voting for your preferred party, even if they are unlikely to get a majority will not lead to your vote being “wasted”.The only country in Europe that uses FPTP is the UK.

A vote for the Die Linke in Germany does not help the CDU. This is because Germany has proportional representation and America does not.A similar situation exists in the UK.

In the 2015 election the UKIP Party got 12.6% of the vote but only one seat in the 650 member house. (However this shows how strong the anti EU message is).So an American voter has only two choices because their vote is wasted.

3,Would Republicans or Democrats support a balanced budget amendment?,Democratic Party vs. Republican Party,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Some would.The Balanced Budget Amendment has been tabled for years. It’s been written, read aloud in Congress. Some State Assemblies have even toyed with putting it up for ratification.The problem is economics. We have an economic system that is not designed to run balanced budgets.A couple of key points.We tend to overspend annually by about the same amount we feed into the Department Of Defense. This is intentional.China buys our debt so we can keep buying their stuff. This also happens with Japan, Taiwan and even Mexico.The largest employer in the Country is actually the Federal Government. About 6 million people, not counting contractors which pushes the number to 7 counting single customer contractors. McDonalds or WalMart can boast similar numbers but without benefits and at a fraction of the pay.Government spending is really spread out. Every single Congressional District spread out.So to balance the budget you have to do some major things.The painful truth is this. The largest lines in the Accounts Payable ledger for the US Government are Social Security, Medicare/aid and the military. All 3 are wildly popular with actual taxpaying citizens. You can’t balance budgets without deep cuts to those 3 entities and veryvlikely some tax increases, which are not generally popular at all.The states that get the biggest benefits of government spending are also the states that claim the most fiscally conservative politicians, out of necessity since they run super tight. Those politicians and their constituents will need to take a serious haircut.The States that produce the most are expensive to operate but they could operate independently without the burden of underperforming states but the underperformers are necessary components in the system, they produce products and laborers that the big economies rely on.So balancing budgets means two things, raising taxes and cutting spending. We would realistically need to reduce federal jobs by about 1/5th. That’s going to be heavily concentrated in the military because well more than half of all federal jobs are military or military support jobs. That’s gonna hurt the outlying areas around military bases. Places like Montana, Kansas etc. The Navy basically has to be based on the coasts. So that’s a non starter from a base standpoint, they also need deep water ports. Army bases. If you live within 75 miles of an Army Base a closure could easily pull a billion dollars out of your local economy.See the problem?Healthcare is stupid expensive in America. We all know this. It’s also a wonky buisness model. You see your customers are effectively being knocked out of work in seeking care. The care for underadvantaged children and the elderly, Medicaid and the institutional mechanism for seniors Medicare actually permit the financial viability of hospitals outside of major metropolitan regions. Cut too deep on these programs and you will lose lots of regional hospitals, that in turn drives away the associated specialists that need admitting privaledges. You could lose access to healthcare services for even well off regions. Poor rural and widely dispersed populations might have a 300 mile trek for services. That means in emergencies people will die. It also pulls money out of local economies. Not in the billions but in the hundred million area fairly easily.So the real issue with cutting spending is the secondary economic impact of government spending and how do those areas that lose it recover?No one, from either end of the political spectrum, has come up with a solution for this.This is just the “big 3” in the most basic of terms. This filters down into every single line of the federal budget. Every line has both a primary and secondary economic impact and cuts have residual effects that compound over time.If we cut spending we have to soak up the negative effects. Politicians have become great at proposing spending cuts that minimize the economic impacts to their own districts and states but savage someother district or region. That’s impossible to pull off if that other region is effectively a tax donor rather than a tax recipient. They will counter, typically, with either sweeping cuts or promise to to cry foul at the recipient regions getting more than they pay in.Then there is the specter of debt. If we were to redesign an economy that somehow operates without federal spending as a primary economic driver, we still need to handle the existing debt.By Law we pay debt first. A Quarter of every Federal Dollar spent goes to the debt and that comes out first. What this means is that in a $2 Trillion dollar operating budget, $500 Billion is going out and can’t be cut until that debt is gone. Entitlement Reform can’t overcome this hurdle. Default isn’t actually an option because it would tank the entire economy. Indeed it would be catastrophic to the global economy as well.That would very likely trigger wars. Wars are stupid expensive.Balanced Budgets are a good idea, but hard to pull off. Especially in a country where taxes are incredibly unpopular. We could balance budgets but not with the current tax system.",116,3,275,"1,377",0,0

She along with President Obama, Ms. Clinton, Senator Shummer and other leading Democrats have done nothing go stop the growth of MS-13 were eager to criticism the President for forceful action seeing it as a way to curry Hispanic votes. Pelosi may not have flatly defended the rapists and murderers that make up MS-13, but she seems ti have more compassion for then than their victims. Rather then seeing the need to safeegard Americans, her concern is with the President’s harsh rhetoric saying “Calling people animals is not a good thing.” She presented no ideas for dealing with MS-13 or condolences for their victims, her only concern was attacking the President. Pelosi insisted “There is a spark of divinity among every person on earth, and we all have to recognize that as we respect the dignity and worth of every person,” feigning an air of religious adherence. Now I would not mind this so much if it was accompanied with a concern for MS-13 victims, a recognition of their atrocities, and a plan for dealing with them. None of this only an attack on the President and a blatant defense of the immigration system which have allowed these evil people into our country, preying on the very immigrants that Peolsi and other Democrats insist they are trying to defend.Senator Shumer’s approach was to lie. He said,”When all of our great-great-grandparents came to America they weren’t “animals,” and these people aren’t either.” This suggests that the President’s comments was about immigrants in general and mot MS-13.And DNC Chairman Keith Ellison does not even believe in borders. The very borders that exist to keep people like MS-13 out. But expresses himself in Spanish to appeal to Hispanics.  The main-line media of course jumped on the Democratic band wagon. Not only did they back Pelosi to the hilt and ignore the brutality of MS-13, like Senator Shummer, they flat out lied. They pretended that the President’s comments were aimed at immigrants and not MS-13 which was clearly the truth. Their approach to journalism has become simply to makeup bold face lies to promote their liberal agenda.Press Secretary Sarah Sanders slammed the media for intentionally leaving context out of Trump's remarks, then doubled down by saying the President hadn't gone far enough. She explained, “This is one of the most vicious and deadly gangs that operates by the motto of rape, control and kill. Frankly, I don't think the term that the president used was strong enough.”And as for animals, Ms. Pelosi mught not like using the term, but MS-13 has not objection.

3,"How can you not profile someone by the color of their skin if your life is at risk, especially given the crime statistics? Will people care if you are dead but politically correct?",Skin Color,Political Correctness,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Man oh man, Lord have mercy upon my tender little soul….I’m not politically correct by a long shot. Political correctness is just a secular, progressive version of “God Says So”. A way of making an assertion without support. But this question shows a horrid level of ignorance. I don’t mean to insult, just stating a fact. Allow me to explain.Short interruption, the robber was an idiot. The gun was jammed and couldn’t shoot. The slide was locked back. If the clerk knew that, then he knew that guy couldn’t fire the gun and just cooperated.Crime correlates with race some but race is not a causal link. Social injustice, stress, violence in the home particular during childhood, opportunities to climb the social and economic ladder, affordable healthcare, and so forth are far more causal to crime than anything else.The racism of focusing on blacks more because the statistics indicate a higher rate also creates that statistic. It’s a self-fulfilling action. The more closely you watch a group the more of that group that will get caught. There’s probably more crime gotten away with by Anglos, Asians, and other groups simply because they don’t get the scrutiny.Those statistics are created by a regionally limited group of people. Mostly in low income, high crime areas that are the result of forced segregation of our past. Here’s a good book for some valuable education Our Two Societies: Andre Davis: 9781521963296: Amazon.com: Books. Rural blacks probably have a crime rate equal to other ruralites as they’re just as sensitive to their personal reputations as any other rural, small town person.Also you’re inadvertently committing a composition fallacy. Simply because the crime rate of blacks is higher than other skin colors, doesn’t have much of anything to do with the particular black person you’re dealing with. This is a real common mistake. Just because .013 percent of drivers are involved in a fatal accidents doesn’t mean that .013 percent of the time I will be in a fatal accident. It depends upon my driving habits, and when, where, and what I drive. The crime rate statistic slapped on blacks overall doesn’t apply to any particular individual black. That good black Baptist preacher is much less likely to mess with you than any violence worshiping Neo-Nazi meth head.Judge by behavior and environment. Little story about two black men meeting in front of me at a gas pump. One was a older, rural male that was driving a well used pick-up truck. The other was a younger, urban male driving an older small commuter car. The farmer was trying to get his F-250 extended cab, long bed truck into position when the younger male darted in and blocked him some. The farmer ask way the guy cut him off and the younger guy just shrugged and said he’d be gone in a minute. Oblivious or uncaring about the rudeness of his action.That resulted in me and the farmer having a nice conversation about these damned kids today. There’s nothing there related to skin color. It’s culture. The young male probably was raised in a crowded area and accustomed to ignoring people and the farmer was raised in a much earlier time in the country were human contact was much more valued. That farmer and I also has a nice talk about our trucks, I had just purchased an F-250 extended cab, and how to catch hogs. I’m part time rural and 60% redneck.Criminals act in certain ways to facilitate the crime. They’ll dress to hide weapons, they look for areas where they’re harder to catch, they’re scanning for vulnerabilities to exploit, ….no matter what their race. Honest people just go about their own business and don’t care about who sees them or how to exploit much of anything. Learn behavior and judge by that, not race.The likelihood of a group of blacks ransacking a house in a really nice neighborhood with the windows of the house open and them being there more than five minutes is nil. You see that, you’re seeing people that probably belong there. The odds of a black man being a criminal if he’s running down the street in clothing good for exercise within a gated community is nil. He’s probably a resident jogging. Their behavior and dress relative to the environment should tell one that.Let me tell you another story. I was driving in heavy, downtown traffic (by the way, “downtown” here in Austin, Texas is an area, whereas I understand in New York, New York it’s a direction), I saw two black men driving. One was in his early twenties, wearing a black leather jacket, a red bandanna on his head, slouching, and driving an upscale sports car. The other one was wearing a white dress shirt, skinny black tie, sitting upright, and driving a Toyota Landcruiser. My thoughts were that the young male was a drug dealer with the Bloods because of the way the Bloods and Crips supposedly display the colors red and blue and the bandanna didn’t fit his mode of dress, but this is Texas and it could have been just a young computer programmer, or other well paid job that young folks can get, that was using his bandanna to keep his hair clean and he had a bit of macho attitude.My thoughts about the other male were that he was a engineer of some sort, had a wife and several kids, and needed that SUV to drive them around. Skin color only played a role in that I thought of the Bloods and Crips rather than the KKK or M-13, what the media has told me about said gangs, and that I remember the incident because I really didn’t know if the young guy really was a drug dealer or just another Texas fella using his bandanna despite his other clothing. Had he been an Anglo I wouldn’t have made that kind of association.Had there been no red bandanna I wouldn’t have make the gang connection. Had he been of another race I would have thought the bandanna was a bit out of place but hey, Austinites do that. Had he been in a work truck or wearing clothing associated with physical labor I’d figured he was a working stiff like me. I probably wouldn’t have remembered any of those events either.I remember it because that red bandanna trigger the association and how my reaction was totally different from the guy driving the large SUV. So in this case, race plays a bit of a role but I’m still making a judgement, that’s not known to be accurate, based on clothing and choice in automobiles.Don’t be judgmental of course, but when you have to use your judgment base it on behavior, environment, and good reasoning skills.",1k,13,99,264,0,1

But now they say ""no way, we disdain slavery.”It is accurate to say that in the antebellum period, the party that most-championed slavery in US politics was the Democratic party in the southern states. The democratic party dominated in the south, and championed the interests of the US agrarian economy at the national level.During the Jim Crow period, it’s fair to say that both major parties were the party of white supremacy, in the southern states (where many whites remained committed to it). Both had minorities that didn’t like that sort of thing, but until the Civil Rights era white supremacy wasn’t a national-party thing, it was a regional thing. Majorities of Republicans and Democrats, in the old confederate states, were either white supremacists, or were unwilling to rock the political boat.This meant that when the national Democratic party (which had been at odds with its southern constituents on the question of race since before the civil war) embraced civil rights/opposed Jim Crow in the 1960s, it meant that the Democrats in the southern states were at odds with their national party. In the very next presidential election, the GOP would court those alienated Dixiecrats, and they shifted en masse to the Republican party. This shift altered the balance of political influence in the south, which has gone to the GOP ever since.For half-a-century, the GOP has deliberately exploited — and inflamed — white racial animus, as a means of obtaining political power. That isn’t partisan hyperbole; it’s historical fact. In 1964, the Democratic Party’s embrace of civil rights left most of the white South (and hefty portions of the white North) without a political home. This development provided Republicans with a great opportunity, so long as they were sufficiently cynical — or reactionary — to exploit it.Richard Nixon was both. “We’ll go after the racists,” Nixon’s special counsel John Ehrlichman wrote, summarizing the spirit of his boss’s 1968 campaign. “The subliminal appeal to the anti-black voter was always present in Nixon’s statements and speeches.”~[How the GOP Can Prove It Isn’t a Party for White Supremacists]No, the cohort of America that was once the core of the ‘party of slavery’ left the Democrats.Doesn't that prove that labels mean nothing?No, it just means the label might once have been true and that doesn’t mean it is today. This ‘party of slavery’ assignation just shows that labels can be used to promote as true today things that are not true any more.Today, what is undeniably true is that the GOP is the party of white nationalism.[1] [2] [3] [4]It used to be that the GOP was willing and able to keep its white nationalists at the margins and out of power, but that’s no longer the case. It is now openly and explicitly the party of asserting white control, even if it must subvert democracy itself (or engage in violence) to obtain that end:In 1957, the conservative movement’s flagship publication wrote the following of the civil-rights movement:“The central question that emerges — and it is not a parliamentary question or a question that is answered by merely consulting a catalog of the rights of American citizens, born Equal — is whether the White community in the South is entitled to take such measures as are necessary to prevail, politically and culturally, in areas in which it does not predominate numerically? The sobering answer is Yes — the White community is so entitled because, for the time being, it is the advanced race.”Is the logic of the Republican lawmaker who pushes legislation that depresses turnout in black communities — not because he disapproves of their skin tone, but merely because he fears that they haven’t yet learned to see the public good as he does — really so different?In that same 1957 editorial, the still-revered William F. Buckley continued:“It is more important for any community, anywhere in the world, to affirm and live by civilized standards, than to bow to the demands of the numerical majority. Sometimes it becomes impossible to assert the will of a minority, in which case it must give way; and the society will regress; sometimes the numerical minority cannot prevail except by violence: then it must determine whether the prevalence of its will is worth the terrible price of violence.”The fear of an ascendent, nonwhite majority — and the social “regression” that it will inevitably induce — is one of the modern GOP’s animating anxieties. Republicans in the Trump administration and Congress have voiced this fear, explicitly. During the 2016 election, senior White House national security staffer Michael Anton wrote that a Clinton victory would mark the “death” of the United States, because it would lead to “the ceaseless importation of Third World foreigners with no tradition of, taste for, or experience in liberty,” thereby rendering the electorate “more left, more Democratic, less Republican, less republican, and less traditionally American with every cycle.”~[How the GOP Can Prove It Isn’t a Party for White Supremacists]There you have it. The GOP’s modern engagement in voter suppression doesn’t just coincidentally happen to disproportionately impact voters of color, it is expressly intended to do that.The GOP has had every opportunity to repudiate its birthers, its white nationalists, its casual racists. But at every opportunity, it declines to do that. Instead, we hear dishonest claims that “it’s the democrats that are racists” as a way to muddy the waters and change the subject.Footnotes[1] The GOP Is Now the White Nationalist Party, and That Isn’t Changing Anytime Soon[2] The GOP Is America's Party of White Nationalism[3] America's dark underbelly: I watched the rise of white nationalism[4] Trump, Fox News, and the Mainstreaming of White Nationalism",932,72,2.5k,"2,455",0,11

But now they say ""no way, we disdain slavery.” Doesn't that prove that labels mean nothing?",Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"As I have said before, saying that the Democrats were the party of slavery ONLY meant something before, during and for the remainder of the 19th century. Back then, the Democrats were the Conservative Party, while the Republicans were the Liberal Party. Is that still true today? Of course NOT, the Republicans are the Conservative Party, while the Democrats are now the Liberal Party.Theodore Roosevelt, 26th President (1901 to 1909) was the LAST Liberal Republican President. William H. Taft, the Republican President who replaced Roosevelt, was their 1st Conservative President, was the leader of the conservative half of the progressive wing of the Republican Party in the early 20th century, his greatest achievement was to expel the left wing of the GOP in 1912 and to move the party, and the Supreme Court, to the right, for a generation. (Conservapedia).Still most blacks stayed Republicans, because Lincoln had freed the slaves, and most Southern Democrats, ESPECIALLY the Racist Bigots, stayed in the Democratic Party, unable to see themselves ever joining the Party of Lincoln, since he had freed their slaves.Then during the Great Depression, blacks began a mass migration to the Democratic Party as it moved more & more to the Left, and conservatives outside of the south, began moving to the Republican Party, as it moved to the Right.Under Truman, he INTEGRATED the US Militaries. Then under Eisenhower, the Supreme Court Ruled that Schools could no longer be Separate but Equal, that they had to be INTEGRATED. And later on in Ike’s administration, they passed a Civil Rights (Light) Act. The final nail, in switching the parties philosophies, was the Civil Rights Act of 1964, outlawing Racial Discrimination in schools & work, AND the Fair Housing Act of 1968 outlawing Segregated Neighborhoods, both passed during Democrat Lyndon Johnson’s Presidency, by Northern Democrats & Republicans, while their Southern Brethren both voted against it.While very few blacks remained in the Republican party after that, the White, Conservative Southern Democrat, still stayed a Democrat, in Party Name ONLY, even as they voted for the Republican running for President over the Democrat, and in Congress, the Southern Democrats tended to vote with the Republicans. Don’t get me wrong, the trickle to the Republican Party began in 1964, with Strom Thurmond and other former DixieCrate Democrats became Republicans.Then for some reason, in the 1980’s the flood gates opened, and even MOST of the White Nationalists/Racists who had been Democrats all of their lives, became Republicans. Former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke switched parties, ran as a Republican and won a seat in the Louisiana State House (His only win). The 1990’s still found a lot of Southern Democrats changing parties to become Republicans, and in this century its back down to a trickle, but they are still changing. The most famous recent Switch over was Kim Davis, that Kentucky County Clerk, who after the Supreme Court Ruling, whined that her religious beliefs were being violated, and even spent a weekend in jail before the Judge could work out a compromise. Immediately upon being released from jail, she converted to being a Republican, which she had truly been all along & didn’t know it.Neither party today is FOR slavery, so to claim that the Democrats as less than honest because they now say, “no way, we disdain slavery.” is a LIE on the part of the Questioner, who is so sure of him/herself that he is ANONYMOUS.",102,12,49,470,0,2

It would be a nightmare for anyone developing policies for the public if there were no way to group similar things together. Just imagine you couldn’t nicely group people into socioeconomic groups for making budget decisions, for instance — you’d need to work on a level of detail which makes it impossible to administer the policy.Sometimes, you have to sacrifice some precision to make things work.",62,5,198,681,0,0

But of course the social context has evolved.Republicans were always, at least in general, against slavery, and against state-mandated racial segregation. For most of their history Democrats supported those horrid ideas, either overtly or tacitly.At a certain point, approximtely after the death of JFK, the Democrats begin to move radically leftward, while the Republicans pretty much stayed where they were. The Democrats moved from being anti-civil-rights to taking the concept of civil rights to ridiculous extremes and absurd contortions. But you also had the segregationist Dixiecrats in the party.So you had some Democrats who continued to support segregation. And you had others who thought that “civil rights” necessitated building crime-prone housing projects in middle-class neighborhoods, forced busing of schoolchildren, instituting racial quotas for colleges and civil service jobs, and taking the side of black criminals over police officers. No middle ground with those folks.Meanwhile, the Republicans pretty much remained as the party of individual rights. Not group rights, not special rights, just individual rights. And that's more or less how the parties switched places. The Democrats have been all over the map, embracing any racial idea as long as it was destructive.

2,Are democrats making a mistake by focusing so much on Trump’s personality?,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Democrats are wrong to focus on Trump’s personality. I believe this mainly for two reasons.Firstly, the voters of America knew all about his undesirable personality before they went to vote in 2016, yet still he became president. And, yes, he didn’t win the popular vote but he did still win enough states to gain the highest office. Many had thought with a character such as his, the Democratic nominee would have had a landslide win. This clearly didn’t materialise. This is a bigger problem than many Democrats are acknowledging, arguably, their biggest problem going forward.Secondly, they are unable to argue the most popular way of discrediting a president who is fighting for re-election/surviving their first term which is the “he didn’t do what he promised, so how can he be trusted for another four years?” He has delivered on almost all his campaign pledges, not least of which the sweeping tax cuts, scrapping the Iran deal, scrapping the Paris Agreement, scrapping NAFTA, bringing North Korea to the table, attempting to dismantle the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), and the list goes on. No-one can challenge him on his record in office and this makes his personality irrelevant to some or arguably most voters because he is perceived to be a president who gets on with the job and what he says happens. This, is for many, a refreshing change in the stalemated American politics of recent years.To a considerable extent, these two reasons are why Democrats need to no longer focus on Trump’s personality and instead go to the American people with a viable alternative who has the best of both worlds; discipline to get the job done and a desirable personality.

My fellow voters put people into utter power over their lives either through apathy or solely on social issues and never looked out for themselves carefully financially or legally and now it is too late to have any major party capable of anything to stop it-but somehow campaign finance prerogatives are not the problem.

That they could ignore whatever law they wanted. It was the same old tired nullification policy that the South had followed before the Civil War.What California is arguing actually has a Supreme Court precedent behind it. Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898 (1997) This case was brought by one of Trump’s favorite Sheriffs because he felt that local law enforcement shouldn’t have to conduct the background checks for handguns required by the Brady Bill. The court completely agreed with him, local law enforcement is not responsible for enforcing federal law and may not be compelled to do so. It is also a form of double taxation because we pay federal taxes and that pays for federal law enforcement and when we pay state taxes, income, property, sales, etc that pays for state and local law enforcement to enforce state laws and local ordinances. They each have their own jurisdictions.The 10th Amendment very clearly states that he federal government has powers that it claims for itself and that all others may be delegated to he states. Regulating immigration is one of the powers that he federal government has claimed for itself, state governments have no power there. ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES This case at least the top portion shows all of the reasons why this is a sole federal government power. If it is a sole federal government power it is also solely the federal government’s responsibility and states cannot be compelled to bear the burden and waste their resources doing the federal government’s job for them.So the difference is that Wallace was in defiance of the Supreme Court and California has Supreme Court precedent behind it.

2,Do you think that the Democratic party will collapse?,Democratic Party (US politics),Republican Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"Democrats predicted the Tea Party would tear the GOP in two. Now Republicans are predicting that The Resistance will tear the Democratic Party in half.All that’s really happened is that these factions within each party have pushed the primary candidates on each side further and further from center to appeal to these subgroups of motivated partisan voters, leaving most Americans disaffected with both parties’ platforms. Pew Research surveys show that in 2009, for the first time since the Bush Sr Administration, a plurality of Americans identified as political independents, and they haven’t looked back; as of 2014, 39% of likely voters were independents. Gallup’s polling, which has the latest data I can find, identified 45% of likely voters as politically independent as of early April 2018, with a clear unbroken Independent plurality emerging from a plurality-Democrat voter pool happening just after the 2012 election. These voters will “lean” toward one ideology or the other, but reserve the right to change their minds, and don’t really want to publicly identify with either party until they absolutely have to.The problem is that registered party affiliates are the most likely primary voters, and those primary voters tend to be concentrated ideologically to the extremes of the American political spectrum. So, the most extreme elements of an increasingly polarized political system are the ones presenting these fairly absurd “lesser of two evils” decisions to the rest of us in the general election, because up to half the likely voters don’t like either party well enough to help shape the party platform in the primaries.Could a new party catering to the moderate independents emerge in the center, marginalizing both parties? Unlikely; the Democrats and Republicans, though ideologically fluid to the extent that they practically changed sides from left to right during the Twentieth Century, have been the primary power-brokers in the U.S. since Reconstruction. Any effort to motivate the nation from the center faces two major problems; first, they’re targeting a voter base that is demonstrably uninterested in politics until every other November (if not every fourth November), and second, as they’re motivating these voters, there is an extreme risk of those voters, now personally invested in the outcome, putting that investment in one of the two lead horses in the race to maximize the chance of their candidate winning. Duverger’s Law reigns supreme in U.S. politics, regardless of how many people identify this independent voter bloc as a hidden third party just waiting to be mobilized and organized.",558,4,656,"2,560",0,0

It is an abomination against humanity.The unrestrained greed of some people in a society, results in enormous wealth for them. But it also produces conditions of decline and poverty for most of the rest of the society. So the problem arises for those who accumulate the wealth, of convincing the people they victimize, not to overthrow them and burn them at the stake, or introduce them to the guillotine, for their injustices against society. And that is why capitalism was invented. It is nothing but the legitimization of the very behavior that in a decent society, would result in prison sentences for the “capitalists”.In the US where “capitalism” is revered as a religion of sorts, the people who hold the wealth do two things to retain their power:They make all of the economic policies themselves and not surprisingly, those economic policies benefit them exclusivelyThey promote the utter nonsensical fairy tale of “free market capitalism”, as if it was actually valid, so that the public doesn’t awaken to the reality that they are being fleeced, and the wealthy class are doing the fleecing.So they promote the ridiculous idea that “markets” control the economic outcomes by some divine natural process that humankind has no control over, or any role in. According to the religious mythology of capitalism, “markets” decide who wins and who loses in the economy, rewarding the “hard working and productive” with the appropriate amount of wealth, and punishing the “lazy and unproductive” with poverty.The reality of course is that “markets” are controlled by people, and who benefits and who loses, is a product of who is in control.We should wonder about the efficacy of a system that seems to reward only 1% of the population, at the expense of everyone else. And that is just what “capitalism” does. The outcome in the US would suggest that only 1% of us work hard, and the rest of us are lazy moochers.And as long as we are gullible enough to continue believing the Free Market fairy tale, it will only get worse.",1k,19,279,"3,355",1,0

We all returned to stone age, living with no scientific knowledge of any kind. What kind of society will we form?At the beginning, we all will be hunter gatherer. But that’s limited by dunbar number (150) since we do not have sufficient intelligence to keep track of all the people and all the favours. (Remember that all knowledge have been wiped, so writing was still to be invented).Then we will be an agrarian society after farming is rediscovered. Why? Because it is more stable than hunting and gathering. Hunting and gathering can only support very small number of human population, which have to be nomadic since all the prey and plantation in the area will move away or become extinct by being hunted. Eventually animals must be domesticated and plants must be tended if they are to provide lasting production.What kind of society will agrarian civilizations embrace? Most likely feudalism. It is a logical structure where the most powerful “warlord” i.e. the king, own all the lands - and then delegate the ruling via his nobles, who in turn delegate the ruling via their knights and at the bottom of the structure - the peasants.Now, I don’t know about you, but being a peasant sounds worse to me than being a cog in the engine of capitalism.

Suffice it to say that in today’s world, the most basic machine shop imaginable can manufacture a functional, fully automatic weapon (e.g., see the story of the Sten Gun during World War II). Criminals, terrorists, and madmen will always find a way to kill, whether using guns, trucks, acid, bombs, etc. Guns, at this juncture in history, can not be “un-invented”.(b) Several states have attempted to (unconstitutionally) restrict the ownership of guns that that the Supreme Court (in the Heller decision) have ruled lawful for citizens to possess. Ignoring the clear text of the Second Amendment for a moment, let’s look at the compliance rate for these draconian laws. In New York, Andrew Cuomo’s “SAFE Act” restricted access to one million firearms. Compliance rate? Less than five percent. In short, Americans will, for the most part, not comply with plainly unconstitutional laws.(c) The Second Amendment was written in a time when every able-bodied citizen was considered part of “the militia”. A militia, in those times, carried broad definitions. It could be part of a standing army or even a citizen-organized police force. As such, the Constitution was only ratified by the states because the Bill of Rights codified — in plain terms — the God-given right of citizens to keep and bear arms. Now, the Constitution includes methods to repeal, amend or propose new amendments. However, the progressive Democrat Party has no interest (at least it appears) in organizing a grass-roots effort to amend the Constitution and alter the Second Amendment. This simple fact — the Democrats’ unwillingness to even follow the process — should tell you how vastly unpopular such a measure truly is.Firearms are a tool that can be used for good or evil.

8,"If guns are banned, will pro gunners hand in their guns peacefully?",Gun Control Laws,Libertarianism (politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"Honestly? No. I should say that some might. and that’s fine.But most would not. I live in a state that does not require gun registration. Neither the federal government nor the state has any idea what guns I own or how many I have, with one exception. The suppressor I have needed to be taxed and cannot be legally transferred without a mountain of federal paperwork, so that item, they could take. As for the rest, they have no idea. Private party sales are also legal in my state, so most of the guns I have purchased were done face to face with people I found over the internet. There are no records of the transaction of any kind.So like a lot of people in my situation, a “turn in your guns” edict could be casually dismissed. Sorry officer, I sold those. No I don’t have records, I’m not required to keep any. No, I cant remember who. Yes, it was cash.This is the main reason gun owners are so resistant to registries. It’s the first step in confiscation. They cant take what they don’t know you have.Sure, they could bust down the door, but then not only are they violating the 2nd amendment by banning guns, but now they are violating the 4th amendment, the one against warrant-less searches.And if they are going to take the guns, they are violating the 5th amendment in several places, due process and equal protection being just a few.So at this point the governemnt will have shown themselves to be an enemy of the people and the US military are obliged by oath to destroy them.So if they think the Army is going to do their dirty work for them, kicking down the doors of friends and family in order to take guns they themselves likely have at home and want to keep, they need to re-assess.Most of the confiscation burden will fall on police and alphabet agencies like the the FBI and DHS, but the end result will be the same. Even if 100% of those agents shirked their own oath to protect the constitution and tried to take the guns, they would be woefully out manned and outgunned.Sorry, a few hundred thousand federal agents and one million LEO’s are not going to survive against 100 million gun owners with 300 million guns and several trillion rounds of ammunition.If that were to really happen, I estimate between 10K and 50k officers killed in the first year with three times that number wounded nationwide before they really got the point.I mean, if officers are too scared to engage a single untrained teenager with an AR-15 and 10 round mags in a high school, what chance do they have against the 6 million veterans of the recent gulf wars, most of whom are gun owners? C’mon. Get fucking real here.I estimate less than 1/3 of those casualty numbers for civilians. They will have far superior numbers in any fight with LEO’s who are surrounded and have to walk into an ambush every time the drive into a neighborhood to get some guns. By that time the military would intervene and the government deposed, and national elections held for a new president.So no, I really don’t see gun owners handing over their guns. In order to do that the government would have to violate so many parts of the constitution that the whole affair quickly becomes untenable.But remember, it’s only untenable because we already have the guns.

Many might hold back a couple of their favorites, but they would be hidden away somewhere until forgotten about by future generations.Of course, there would be a select few who would fight it out to the bitter end, and much loss of life would result. Many in law enforcement, far more than most imagine, would just refuse to shoot at these people, not wanting to engage in a fight where they might have to kill someone for a cause they believe in themselves, and not wanting to risk their own lives on the “wrong” side of the cause. Whether they were fired and replaced would depend, largely, on local politics and values. In some places those members of law enforcement who refused to put any effort into enforcing such a law would be heros, and in others they would be villains. Mostly they would reflect the mainstream of their own societies, so there would be different results in New Jersey compared to Wyoming, for example.For most, though, the prospect of becoming a felon for life would be enough motivation to either turn over the guns or hide them somewhere so inaccessible that they are pretty much “out of the picture” anyway.How much resistance happened would depend largely, on how abrupt the transition is. Try to ban every gun at once, across the whole country, and it might look a little bit like a civil war, states becoming “sanctuary states” and hindering federal officers, etc. However, if it's done very gradually, with partial bans starting in certain places and spreading, ever so slowly, to other states before the next round of new regulations and partial bans begins, then you get more people willing to comply. Both sides recognize this, which is why the one side mostly just tries to gradually tighten the controls, increase the regulations, and pick individual guns and accessories to ban a few at a time. Recognition of this tactic is also why people who value the right to keep and bear arms resist every attempt at stricter controls, because historically those steps are not ends in and of themselves but “baby steps” to ease in more complete control.Basically, even though most gun owners value their livelihood, peaceful existence with their families, and freedom more than their guns (or especially more than one particular gun in an incremental ban scenario), enough would resist violently, and enough state and local governments would be on the side of the resistance, to make it a very dangerous situation for both sides.",748,21,4.2k,"2,235",0,0

Those who seem unable to DO anything about it.Furthermore guns aren't and never have been “the problem” with these shootings here in the US or in Europe.The fairly recent spate of crimes committed with brickbats, vehicles, and knives is proof of that fact.In the US the proof of that statement lives in the FACT that when we had 47% of families owning guns in the late '60s we saw these shootings once in 10 years. Yet now with 31% of families owning guns we have these shootings every 60 days or so.Here's a complete discussion of that with stats and notes galore:Kris Rosvold's answer to Why don’t people understand that guns are the cause of mass shootings?So what IS the real problem here?A mental health system which was intentionally broken by Reagan ignoring over 20 years of citizens’ demands for reform and the Democrat Party Brass then CONTINUING to ignore that it was destroyed on purpose.A namby pamby bullshit attitude in schools that it's “somehow wrong” to punch a bully as hard as you can. Look. The reality is that kids who bully understand only one thing and that is immediate and superior force applied to their tender hides. Banning them from schools doesn't work because its often exactly what they want any way. They don't care about learning, all they care about is the rush they get from beating on weaker kids. I have personal experience here where I used a fish sap to even the playing field against 3 bullies. I won and then they tried to buddy up to me BECAUSE I WOULDN'T TAKE THEIR SHIT PEACEFULLY.Guns aren't the problem, and lack of sufficient laws aren't the problem either.In Florida it's come out that between the police and FBI there were over 47 direct contacts with the shooter in the months before. Not one fucking thing was done to stop him or to address his mental health issues in any of those forty seven contacts. Not One Thing. The FBI also ignored a direct tip and the danger this individual presented which was delivered just weeks before the shooting.

So perhaps lets pass a law which says cops ARE legally obliged to perform their duty to protect.Perhaps lets start knocking in OUR legislators doors with literal pitchforks so they listen to us instead of their corporate bribers.Perhaps we DEMAND an effective healthy care system whereby the Insurance Mafia can't skim 40% to 60% of our health care dollars right off the top and then demand that we be happy with the barest crumbs they deign to drop.The grand Orwellian lie of US Health “Insurance”Perhaps we DEMAND an end to planned Wars For Profit so that poor kids have a chance to escape poverty WITHOUT having to become cannon fodder for corporate profits.War Is A Racket, by Major General Smedley Butler, 1935Go after the real problems and quit drinking the mass media cool aid which tells us this shit is the best we're entitled to..",4.3k,60,6.1k,"8,196",0,3

The biggest blow-back that I can think of is that gun-owner rights will become a much bigger electoral issue, as their worst fears are confirmed.

5,Arthur Schlesinger contends there’s 40 year cycles between liberal and conservative swings in this country? Does that mean we are heading toward a liberal upswing?,Political Liberalism Vs. Political Conservatism,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Since just three years ago Obama was President and he was very liberal, I’d have to say, if Schlesinger’s theory is correct, that we are moving into a conservative swing. However, I don’t think we are moving in either direction. I actually think we are moving into a time of totalitarianism and authoritarianism.We all know how conservatives are accused over and over of both totalitarianism and authoritarianism. Conservatives are said to be trying to force traditional American morals and values on everyone. I don’t even need to elaborate on this because we see this elaborated on in nearly every politically charged question on Quora.However, what many fail to realize is the exact same claim is true of today’s liberals. The neo-liberalism that is promoted by cultural influencers (CNN, MSNBC, mainstream press, major television networks, Hollywood, the majority of the music industry) is basically totalitarian and authoritarian. See definitions at the end of the answer.Let me explain: This is why I see today’s liberals as totalitarian and authoritarian. Liberals demand politically correct speech at all times, or else lose your job and your reputation or business will be destroyed.Liberals demand correct behavior. For example: pat a person who doesn’t identify with your gender on the back, and as they turn, your hand goes where you never intended it to go, and bam, you are out of a job and labeled a pervert in social media, life destroyed.Liberals punish women who complain, when a man dressed like a man, acting like a man, talking like a man, comes into a women’s restroom; or openly displays his penis in a “womens” locker room; because he claims to feel like a woman that day.Liberals demand that conservatives keep their heads down and mouths shut to survive in any business dominated by liberals (hollywood, tech, etc.) or have your colleagues do their best to get you fired and blackballed from the industry.Liberals demand white people be ashamed of the color of their skin, ashamed of their culture and ashamed of their ancestors. Liberals applaud and endorse “no whites allowed” events, safe spaces, dorms and days.The left has become quite totalitarian and authoritarian, as totalitarian as they claim conservatives are, and every bit as authoritarian as they claim conservatives are.The only truly non-authoritarians these days are libertarians. Whose motto is basically, live and let live as long as you don’t physically harm others or do real tangible damage to others or their property.Since the political parties that control the landscape are conservative and liberal and not libertarian, I would conclude that we are moving into a period of a mix of totalitarianism and authoritarianism which each party claims the other is steeped in.Definition: Totalitarianism is a political concept where the state recognizes no limits to its authority and strives to control every aspect of public and private life wherever feasible.Definition: Authoritarianism is a form of government characterized by strong central power and limited political freedoms. Individual freedoms are subordinate to the state and there is no constitutional accountability under an authoritarian regime.",185,10,34,193,0,0

Was that decade therefore a ‘conservative’ period, or a ‘liberal’ period? Or perhaps neither label fits as neatly as we are told.The same thing happens now.

Can’t the FBI and the president monitor whatever they want?,Federal Bureau of Investigation,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"There is something called the 4th Amendment right against unreasonable searches and seizures. Monitoring, electronic or otherwise, is a search that invokes the 4th Amendment. As such, a warrant must be obtained based upon an affidavit signed by a police officer, a prosecutor, or the witness giving the information. The affidavit subjects the signer to perjury charges if false. All this must be presented to an impartial judge to determine if there is probable cause to issue the warrant. If the judge believes there is probable cause, he/she will sign the warrant. Warrants must be executed within 96 hours of the occurrence of the offense or they are considered stale. The constitution and the courts have determined that after 96 hours the evidence of a crime is unlikely to remain at the location to be searched. Then the search becomes unreasonable. Any evidence gained would be suppressed. Even the police are not above the constitution.So, the answer to your question is NO, neither the FBI nor the president can monitor anybody, let alone Trump’s presidential campaign without probable cause that either a crime has been committed, or national security is at stake.

A low-skill immigrant can’t do the MBAs job — but she can take care of kids.If the nanny’s wages amount to $40,000, how much has she contributed to the economy?

With the nanny, society continues to enjoy chidcare services, and gains and additional $100,000-valued worth of labor as the MBA goes to work. $40,000 vs $140,000; the immigrant’s marginal contribution is the difference.GDP will overstate the immigrant’s contribution as $140,000, because GDP does not count a mother’s childcare as production, since there is no monied transaction, but it would add both the MBAs and the nanny’s wages.We cannot know the magnitude of an immigrant’s contribution, because we cannot know the opportunity costs facing those with whom the immigrant engages in exchange. Admitting this is absolutely not hypocrisy; though attempting to answer the question in the first place suggests a degree of unfamiliarity with how markets work.",475,18,700,"1,050",0,0

Immigrants, regardless of their status, bring a whole lot more than that. They bring a love of our country that many people born here lack, why else would they risk everything to come here. They bring a determination to reach their goals that few in our country have ever had to demonstrate, just look at the ordeal they have to suffer through to get here. Look at the high family values that so many of them have. Although they rarely make much money, they send much of it back to support their families.Picking fruits and other things Americans don’t want to do is not what immigrants contribute, but it is one thing that reflects their importance to our economy. But for these immigrants, many of whom are undocumented, many farms would watch their crops die in the field. Many slaughterhouses would have to slow production for lack of employees. Since agricultural is a major part of our export economy, the lack of these immigrants will affect our balance of payments, weakening the value of the dollar and increasing the cost of almost all every consumer item. No worries, we won’t go hungry, we will just import more food from Mexico. Although that will also weaken the value of the dollar and increase the cost of everything.As a Soldier, I have served with a large number of immigrants and children of immigrants. I know them as good and honorable people, devoted to America and as patriotic as anyone, and more patriotic than many. In fact, in the year 2007 I had an opportunity to address a number of Soldiers in my unit while stationed overseas. I pointed out that this was the 100th anniversary of my grandfather immigrating to the United States. I told them how he was in our country only a few days before he enlisted in the United States Army. He became a citizen five years later while assigned overseas (in Hawaii). And went on to serve in every rank in the Army from Private to Sergeant Major to Warrant Officer to Lieutenant Colonel while serving in two world wars over a period of 37 years. I then stopped and recognized the half dozen immigrant Soldiers in the room and told them how proud I was to serve with each of them. I would add here about how disappointed I am in how many people who have never served are kicking immigrants today as a scape goat for all of their own personal failures.I know of no immigrant who is getting a free pass.

What we do want to see is logical immigration laws, and sensible enforcement. Right now, it is pretty clear that enforcement is racist.

I know of many undocumented immigrants from Eastern Europe. They came on tourist visas, and never left. But they are white. So nobody is making any fuss about them.“Things Americans don’t want to do” is pretty damn important. Some of those things that “Americans don’t want to do” include agriculture in general, not just produce, but livestock as well; tourism; care-giving; construction; etc. Several industries are hurting right now, because under the current regime, folks who used to work in these areas are not coming.All the jobs need to get done, not just the nice, clean ones that pay well.Letting them in for work is not on humanitarian grounds. It is on practical grounds, to get people to do the work that needs to get done when there aren’t enough Americans willing and able to do them. As Jill Grant mentions in her answer, humanitarian grounds would be for refugees, which has absolutely nothing to do with what they can contribute.Now, that being said, am I in favor of just opening the borders? No. I would like to see enforcement of the requirement to be eligible to work in the US to get paid by US employers, and I would like to see enforcement against employers that violate this.

Most lawyers I know comply with their ethical obligations because it is consistent with their own sense of right and wrong.What a lawyer will do is explain what has to be proven in order to establish a claim for asylum. These things are not secrets, they are readily discernable on a simple google search. They might explain the typical questions they might face. Again, not a secret, thousands of people have gone through the system and know what is involved and are free to discuss it. Finally, and this is the important part, they will help their client figure out what evidence is out there and how to present that evidence at the various interviews and hearings during the process. Unfortunately, no one on the government side has the time to adequately advise claimants for asylum how to do that. So in a very real sense, they are helping the government do what the law wants done, helping the government comply with the law by proving their clients compliance with it.I also understand that some people now are angered that such laws (and treaty obligations) exists.

9,Why do you remain a Democrat?,Democratic Party (US politics),Democracy,Politics,1!,1!,1!,"Well...I have been a registered Democrat since I was old enough to vote and have remained so despite my many misgivings (and political differences) about the party over the past four or five years. I would definitely consider myself to be a Conservative Democrat as my views definitely lean more towards the right than most Dems.I briefly considered the Libertarian party when I noticed the change in my political views but found the ideology to be impractical. And no, I didn't vote for Hillary Clinton nor did I vote for Trump (I voted for the Green party candidate) in the presidential election. I do mostly vote with my party, however, I have and will continue to vote with my conscious rather than blind devotion to a particular party.That said, I have continued to remain a Democrat for a few significant reasons. One, there are many more people who look like me in the Democratic party than in the GOP. I also know and have connections with a few politicians and both are Democrats.Two, I realized that, realistically and for all intents and purposes, America is a two party democracy and/or country for better or fir worse. Therefor, if I or anyone else for that matter want to get anything meaningful done (and I certainly do) it will have to be done through one of the two major parties.

9,Why do you remain a Democrat?,Democratic Party (US politics),Democracy,Politics,1!,1!,1!,"Haven’t even been one for very long. I was registered independent for quite a while. Now, that said, I tend to lean left on many issues and often did indeed find myself voting for the Democratic candidate, but that was because, well, they could win.I registered in 2016 so that I could caucus for Bernie Sanders. I remain…shall we say, highly unimpressed with how the DNC treated him and his supporters, and want them to get the hell rid of the superdelegate system as of yesterday. The people of the party, not the brass, should decide who the candidate is.I also think Clinton would have fared better in the general if it had been clear she won the primary fair and square. She may well still have—a lot of the party liked her, she had great name recognition, she certainly was not hurting for a war chest, and she may well have carried the primary without any thumbs on the scale. But since there were thumbs on the scale, we can never know.And Clinton was symptomatic of the problem that Democrats are too timid, too centrist (more center-right now, since they keep letting the Republicans yank them that way), and too shy of, gasp and clutch pearls, being seen as in any way socialist. They’ve gone a long way in the wrong direction since FDR and the New Deal.So, why am I still registered as a Democrat? Because of the Republicans. To them, I would just say: Look what you have done. Because of you, an unqualified, dangerous lunatic is now at the head of the country, and is causing every bit of damage we predicted he would and them some. Sorry, but whatever sins the Democrats may have committed, they pale in comparison to that. If your judgment is so poor that you would run, let alone elect, Donald Fucking Trump, known to be a liar and a crook even well before he ran for office, there’s nothing your party has to offer me.And of course, that’s just the final straw. The Republicans have been refusing to play by the rules for quite some time now. Heavy filibuster overuse, refusal to do anything bipartisan, blocking a Supreme Court nomination. That’s not how it’s done. The “government is always bad” mantra leaves me cold too—there are many things that are best done by the government. Not by government contractors after ill-advised “privatization”, but by the government, directly.So, I’m registered as a Democrat because, while I’m not always their biggest fan, the alternative always manages to be at least ten times worse. At least as a registered Democrat I do get to participate in Democratic primaries, and maybe when they start seeing how many real progressives get a primary nod or at least a substantial chunk of the vote, they’ll realize they need to start running more progressives and fewer Republican-lite “centrists”. To start winning again, the Democrats need to offer a genuinely different vision for America, a progressive and forward-thinking and cohesive one, not just a watered-down version of the Republican platform.And I hope, in some small way, if I’m counted as a Democrat, I can help bring that to pass.",855,29,2.7k,"5,997",0,0

2,How did Democrats convince themselves that Hillary Clinton was going to claim the Presidency over Donald Trump?,Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"To begin with, Clinton’s nomination was always a done deal. The Democrats, having achieved what they considered an historic victory in electing an African-American to the Presidency (never mind that he was the least qualified presidential candidate within living memory) by doubling down with electing the first woman to the Presidency. The Clinton faction was in firm control of the DNC and in particularly the critical super-delegate block. The wonder is that a strident left-wing candidate like Bernie Sanders managed to come within a hair of upsetting a plan that had been in place since Bill Clinton was elected in 1992. They assumed that la Clinton would slide into office based on an overwhelming response from woman.There were several problems with this. It is hard to think of any candidate for president since the beginning of the Republic who came freighted with so much baggage. One must admit that, on paper, la Clinton appealed qualified, having served in the Senate (after a strong Republican candidate for the seat, Rudy Giuliani, was forced to drop out of the race because of illness) and then (after failing to secure the nomination in 2008) getting the consolation prize of being Secretary of State. One must also admit that she is an intelligent woman. However, she starts with one major problem. She is simply not likeable. Stories of her foul temper and contempt for staff abound. Her projected persona is at the best of times less than warm and authentic, and (as in the Benghazi hearings) often abrasive and condescending. Furthermore, it became rather apparent that she was concealing significant health issues.Beyond that, there was a mounting body of evidence of corruption attached to her: the Clinton Foundation and pay-for-play, the email server, and the Benghazi coverup to begin with. It was evident that the fix was in—the “accidental” meeting between Loretta Lynch and Bill Clinton, James Comey refusing to recommend prosecution—and the way was cleared for her coronation.However, the American electorate at a whole didn’t by it. Donald Trump was not my choice as the Republican candidate (I favored Marco Rubio) but his brashness, his undeniable success as a take-charge-and-get-it-down business person, and his instinct to focus on the real weaknesses of the last administration, like pathetic economic growth, the failure of the Affordable Care Act, the growing contempt for law enforcement, the failure to asset control over our borders, and the astonishing rise of Islamic terrorism and the casual attitude of the administration, gained him the nomination and, ultimately, the Presidency, in spite of all the dirt that the Democrat machine could dig up. In particular, la Clinton did not secure the overwhelming support of women, and she could not overcome the dismal economic performance of the previous administration, which cost the Democrats Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan, and the Presidency.All you really need to know about la Clinton, and the degree to which the Democrat party has become corrupted, is to look at their behavior since the election. La Clinton has blamed everything except the alignment of the planets and, significantly, her own shortcomings, for her loss. The charges of the Trump campaign’s collusion with the Russians have always been spurious, and the increasing evidence of genuine malfeasance in the Justice Department under the previous administration grow more alarming every day. One wonders what the Democrats will do after the November election. Their chances of winning the House are slim, and they are likely to lose a few seats in the Senate. The only thing they seem to do is lurch further to the left, and to increasingly hysterical and irrational denunciations of President Trump.It is early days, but we may be seeing a realignment of parties, with the Republicans claiming more of the center ground, and the Democrats becoming even more isolated on the left.",195,7,260,"2,451",0,0

Still are,as far as I can see.)Most no doubt believed, as I did, that there were still some critical thinking skills and clear eyes looking at what was happening and that they would NEVER vote to let it happen in this country. I thought most Republicans had better brains. And most “progressives.” I’m sure Germans thought the same thing back in the day. “Voting the bums out” does not include “voting the dictator in” in my book.I truly thought that as much ill-conceived hatred there was re Hillary Clinton they would see past that, to her qualifications and to his lack of same. I thought most voters would understand you don’t put a novice in charge, even if he were a well-meaning novice (which he is not). I was wrong. I also assumed Democrats would know better than to believe the lies of the Sean Hannitys of the world. I also thought if we elected a black man we’d elect a woman. Wrong again! Black men got the vote before women did. I didn’t realize misogyny is worse than racism here, and that hatred outweighed common sense, intelligence, love.And NObody gave weight to the Republican voter suppression added to James Comey’s fingers on the scales added to Russian interference if not actual vote changing in 3–4 key voting districts in the upper Midwest because that Perfect Storm of Election Stealing had never quite happened before. It took both the Republicans and the Russians a few decades to get it just right. Were the signs there? Absolutely. Did everyone ignore them? Pretty much.

Wait for it!So, Donald was correct…. it was rigged…. of course, Hillary still won by 3 million votes (the electoral college stole it from her) and Donald lost by 11 million votes if you count the third party votes. So…. whatever that means…. other than that the USA does not have a fair or democratic electoral process, like the world’s other republics/democracies do. So no doubt Russia and Republicans are hoping that will keep most of us away from the ballot box and they won’t have to cancel elections.

Voting against Republicans and a few slogans is not enough of a motivator.

1,Why did the Democratic Party postpone the vote for the 13th Amendment?,13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"The simplest and (in my opinion) most obvious reason is that until 1964, the Democratic Party was essentially the party of the South. The Democratic electoral coalition had, of course, changed over time (for instance, under FDR unions became integral to the Democratic coalition), but the South was until 1964 pretty consistently Democratic.In 1964, however, Republican presidential nominee Barry Goldwater won all of the Deep South. This was completely unheard of at the time. Goldwater was a small government conservative and the South had been at the core of FDR's New Deal coalition. Those principles don't mesh well.So then why did the South vote red that year?I'd argue that the answer to this (admittedly tangential) question is similar to the answer to your initial question. In a word, racism.I hope that pointing out the Deep South's long history of racism isn't controversial; it certainly isn't really disputable. Because the Democratic Party was for so long the party of the South, and the South was the hotbed of slavery in the U.S., before and during the Civil War, the Democratic Party acted essentially as the party of slavery. This is especially clear given that Southern Democrats led the drive for secession. So, of course, their Northern partisan peers were reluctant to pass an Amendment that would injure the institution of slavery - in part, perhaps, out of fear that the South would never return to the Union (and thus restore their former electoral coalition).Barry Goldwater won the South in the Presidential election of 1964 with appeals to racist sentiment (check out Dog Whistle Politics by Ian Lopez for a more detailed explanation of this). It didn't matter that the South had been solidly blue for decades. In 1860, Southern Democrats seceded to protect slavery and white supremacy. In 1964, Barry Goldwater won the South by appearing as a guardian of segregation and white supremacy. The South's politics appear (at least in this case) to be consistent with its legacy of racism.",279,9,61,2,0,0
12,Why are conservatives so against rewriting the constitution to fit modern standards?,U.S. Constitution,Logic (philosophy),Constitutions,1!,1!,1!,"First, let’s take a look at the accuracy of the question itself.Are liberals actively trying to rewrite the constitution and opposed by conservatives?I know our conservative friends have answered this question in droves attacking liberals for an idea that I, as a progressive, find idiotic. We already have a system in place to change the Constitution. It’s called passing an Amendment.So, let’s look at who is calling for the Constitution to be rewritten. To do this, 2/3 of the State legislatures have to pass a resolution through both of their Houses to call for a Constitutional Convention.Here’s a list of the states that have an open call for an Article V Convention for the limited purpose of proposing a Balanced Budget Amendment. (However, many of these states have passed resolutions for an open Convention which would allow members to propose changes to any part of the Constitution). I have indicated which party controls each state legislature:Alaska (R), 	Alabama (R), Arizona (R), Arkansas (R), Colorado (D), Florida (R), Georgia (R), Indiana (R), Iowa (R), Kansas (R), Louisiana (R), Michigan (R), Mississippi (R), Missouri (R), Nebraska (R), New Hampshire (R), North Carolina (R), North Dakota (R), Ohio (R) Oklahoma (R), Pennsylvania (R), South Dakota (R), Tennessee (R), Texas (R), Utah (R), West Virginia (R), Wisconsin (R), Wyoming (R)BBA Campaign ReportMeanwhile, Democratically controlled states that used to have an open call for a Constitutional convention have rescinded those calls over the last year, including New Mexico, Maryland, Vermont, and the Nevada Senate (but there is a question of whether Nevada needs both houses to vote to rescind the call).The March Toward a Constitutional Convention Slows to a CrawlOne of the biggest problems with a Constitutional Convention is that there is no guarantee that a “limited” Convention to create a balanced budget amendment could not spin wildly out of control and damage our basic rights.Wisconsin legislators passed their convention call last November, but there was resistance from Democrats and some Republicans:They say there’s no way to enforce limits on the convention’s scope once it’s underway.Sen. Kathleen Vinehout and others fear a “runaway” convention, what they describe as a free-for-all in which other far-reaching proposals could surface — even ones that undermine basic constitutional freedoms.“There is no safeguard for what gets dealt with when this constitutional convention gets started,” said Vinehout, D-Alma.Even a right wing group like the John Birch Society is alarmed at the possibility of a Convention Call, as the convention might be convinced to make liberal changes to the Constitution, as well as conservative ones.28 States Overdue for an Article V RescissionThe bottom line is…27 out of the 28 states calling for a Constitutional Convention are completely controlled by the Republicans.So I have to ask “why are conservatives so passionate about rewriting the Constitution?”Next, let’s look at the most dominant issues for a Constitutional Convention over the last 50 years (many of these calls were rescinded, but it gives an idea of what states wanted to do). List of state applications for an Article V Convention - Wikipedia:Balanced Budget Amendment (28)Prohibit Abortion (19)No School Busing (18) - to be clear, this is anti-integrationRepeal Citizens United/unlimited campaign spending is not free speech (5)Term Limits on Members of Congress (5)No Judicial Taxing Power (2)Income Tax, Limit Other (2)Flag Desecration (1)Apportionment of Legislature (29) - allows State legislatures to determine representation instead of through the popular voteSo, aside from the anti-Citizens United petitions, and term limits (bi-partisan), every single issue is, or has been in favor of a conservative agenda.Finally, Republicans continually try to rewrite the Constitution through legislation and Supreme Court challenges to issues such as a woman’s right to choose, same sex marriage, and the separation of church and state. In addition, the party has engaged in a systematic program designed to maintain their political power through gerrymandering, voter suppression legislation, cutting early voting days, reducing the number of voting machines in districts that normally vote against them, and approving the use of electronic voting machines which have been hacked and provide no paper trail.It seems to me that people should be more worried these attempts to limit our personal freedoms, remove civil liberty protections and restrict the ability for every voice to count and every vote to be counted.",1.8k,38,858,135,0,5

While I’m not sure what is meant by “modern standards,” I think we need to have additional mechanisms in place to rein in abject government overreach and believe the several proposed ideas below could accomplish such a goal without creating extraordinary havoc other than on the concentration of power that the federal government has absorbed without the constitutional permission to do so.Consumption Tax (CT) - Amend the 16th Amendment abolishing the tax structure it established and create alternative flat CT tax that also defines the CT Percentage explicitly in this amendment, that will support Federal Balanced Budget Amendment below, so as to avoid the % of progressiveness of the CT from ever becoming a political football for future generations.Federal Balanced Budget Amendment. It would limit federal spending to 15% of GDP or collected tax receipts from the prior year, whichever is smaller. Should a catastrophe occur, the federal government could seek a 2 year hiatus from the balance budget requirements, only with the approval from 3/4 of the state legislatures, — limiting the extra spending to 18% during those subsequent two years. This amendment would have to include a carve out of 20% of collected government revenues to be set aside for paying off debt principle (they would still have to pay interest from the general operating fund) — which means federal spending would actually be limited only to 80% of their revenue stream for spending until all federal deficits were paid in full.Repeal the 17th Amendment so that Senators are once again appointed by the legislatures of their states.Term LimitsCongressional Term Limits — 3 terms for the House and 2 terms for the Senate. This amendment would also require that congressional members and their staff live and spend 95% of their time in their districts, with no office allocated for them in Washington DC. This would leave them up to 18 calendar days to get their business done in Washington DC, leaving little time for corruption and outside lobbying efforts.SCOTUS term limits to 12 years - Every presidential term would nominate and replace 3 members of the Supreme Court.Over Riding SCOTUS Decisions.State legislatures would have 2 years to reverse any SCOTUS decision should 3/4 of all state legislatures vote down a SCOTUS decision.Congress would have 2 years to reverse / over ride any SCOTUS decision should 3/4 of each chamber independently vote down a SCOTUS decision.Please note this comes from previous writing of mine, including from Bryce Ebeling's answer to If you had the power to write the next amendment to the US Constitution, what would the next amendment be?",1.6k,55,164,551,0,0

And their masterpiece was the Constitution. See what they figured out was that the reason most empires failed was that too much power was concentrated in too few people. The Constiturion corrects that. It decentralizes power. It takes the majority of two houses of congress and the President to sign off to make a law. There are 435 people in congress.

If we didn’t update any rules, internet fraud, scams, slander, etc. would all be legal. But principles very rarely change with the times if they are good. An example of a principle is the golden rule, do unto others as you would have done unto you. I personally believe that’s a good rule to live by.

Obviously I’m painting with an extremely broad brush, but I don’t think it’s too far off-base. So to conservatives, they celebrate a document that gives explicit powers to government and leaves everything else to the states or to the people. They celebrate a document that explicitly gives them the right to free speech, freedom of religion, and the right to bear arms and defend themselves.Conservatives don’t believe those principles change with the times any more than the golden rule does.

And whose modern standards, mine, your’s or their’s?

To appreciate their astounding brilliance one needs to merely look at the world as it was before them, history reads mostly like a horror novel of dire poverty, disease, oppression and misery. We have problems today, but the ideas of these men have led to an exponential reduction in all these miseries. Something people generally forget when they are flippant about changing the constitution. No one wanting to change the Constitution has EVER produced the Utopia they are ""selling"", so, I think a reality-check is in order to anyone who supposes themselves on-par with the greatness of our framers. I'm not saying we don't have some great thinkers, I'm just saying we need to step VERY carefully before we suppose ourselves on their level, we just aren't.The conservative sees the constitution as words that mean things written with ink on paper and the progressive sees them as ""living and breathing"" and more malleable.So, a conservative wants to ""conserve"" what has been great but imperfect and a progressive presupposes they have a ""better idea"" that can improve on the framers.I think conservatives would point to the extra safeguards put into the vote percentages for Constitutional change and the Federalist Papers and demonstrate the warnings against changing it too fast, and the progressive would play on societies hubris of thinking some modern idea will be a better one.So, there's wisdom in both and there's dangers in both. remember ""change"" can be good, as in the Civil Rights Act of 1965, or ""change"" can be bad as in the move to Nazism in Germany in the 1930's.

Why? Faking outrage draws attention away from real problems and bolsters the negative opinions people have about trans folks.There is a part of the religious conservative right that sees the advancement of LGBTQI individuals as a losing battle against “normalcy,” “traditional American family values,” and such. The REALLY stalwart religious/racist members of the right tie this all together with the “downturn” of American culture going all the way back to segregation, interracial marriage, and other “problems.”But none of these things are actually problems, and it’s all a big act. There are little to no records of “attacks” by trans people to others in bathrooms. In fact, it’s the other way around; people who need to poop are getting bullied if they don’t look feminine enough, or if they really are trans and just need a bathroom.So yeah, it was probably entirely orchestrated with the intent of bringing in voters to the Republican party who are uncomfortable with anyone not straight.Oh, and just so you know… Transsexuals are people who just like to dress up as the opposite sex. This could be straight or gay folks that just want to look different, but are generally ok with their sex from birth. Transgendered means that a person feels as if they ARE a person of the other gender, and that some or all of their gender characteristics at birth were incorrect.

Either way, I would be betraying what I believe are the best interests of my country.Now, if you somehow give me the authority to run the Democratic Party according to my own political views, that would be different. The only problem with that is that in some ways, I’d be moving the Dems to the right of the Republicans! I’d lose my whole base of support, and the very large center-left voting bloc in the country would just form a new party. And they would probably win, since the United States would then have three right-wing parties (“my” Democrats, the Republicans, and the Libertarians) and only one on the left.

The concept behind capitalism is to make things that meet the needs of the market in order to earn a profit. Regulation limits the capitalists ability to capture or create markets and shares of said market. This really applies to the automobile industry like no other.Without weighing in on the positive or negative impact of regulations on society in general, they do drive up the cost of doing business. Seatbelts with a three point harness that have certain load and stress resistance specifications are mandatory on all cats sold in the USA. You can't get around this. You must install the parts. That adds to the price. And its one of a million little things that are required to be done.Keep in mind, we aren't just paying for the parts. We're paying for the assembly as well. And there are regulations regarding nearly every aspect of a workers day. Work environment, minimum wage, liability insurance, maximum hours, equipment failsafe devices and a bunch of other stuff that go on top of the salary and machinery costs.Then we pay for getting them to market. Despite a bunch of deregulation of the shipping industry, there's a ton of regulations still there. Max load for road, rail and boat, maintainence and safety regulations for the vehicles and how they work, max road times and a myriad of other stuff. Again, this is on top of the obvious stuff like salary and expendable logistics.None of these things that regulations require are necessary. Mandatory, yes, a good idea, probably. But the job could get done cheaper without them. And this applies to almost every consumer good.So the cost of a vehicle is driven up by the costs imposed by government.Now, I assume you think in terms of the communist system. To each…from each. So, in your world, does everyone get a car? How many people who can't afford a car even need one? I know a few city dwellers who have never owned a car, despite being able to afford one. I know some folks who can't afford a car, but they never really thought about needing one. So, how do you do the logistics of this in your world?Capitalism works, not because it provides for the people, but because it is an efficient method of resource allocation. The Communist world found this out. Despite the political oppression, most people over there weren't particularly unhappy. Life was pretty good. That is, until the inefficiency of socialism kicked in. Shortages of consumer goods kicked in because the centralized planning just can't figure things out past a few levels.Also, you're only focused on the welfare state part of socialism. That isn't socialism. That isn't communism. That's welfarism and little to do with economics. I could incorporate a town and tax it into a welfare state if I get enough people to buy into it.

This means subsidizing it, getting third parties to pay for it, or encouraging bankers, often through Federal Reserve policies, to lend more money to buyers. What more money spent on something does is to increase the price. More people bidding more money means the people willing to pay the highest price get to buy the product.Do you really think that more of this will help?Anything else the government does tends to increase the cost of production and restrict supply, which will do the opposite of making cars “more affordable”.We’ve had enough of that.",517,19,256,"1,679",0,2

If he were to keep that and get the big oppositional donations he would have an absolutely stupid war chest. His campaign team was also good at spending that money effectively.Second, though more important, Bernie Sanders can turn out the Non-Voters. Kids vote for him, and by kids I mean the under 40 working classes with no party affiliations. That’s an awful big chunk of the electorate but it’s the chunk the usual Duopoly tends to deliberately disenfranchise because they never know what this group wants or how they will vote. But Bernie does.The whole socialist thing is gonna be a hurdle but from last time I think this is less of an issue than people think. Unless you are over 40 you have no tangible attachment to Socialism as anything more than a political dogwhistle.The other side will shout Socialist and think they are evoking Chairman Mao when the other side will be thinking Emanuel Macron.Ted Cruz debated Sanders on Healthcare. Both sides think their guy won. That’s telling. Sanders resurrected the Left in America. Not as a Conservative boogeyman but as an actual ideological concept.The actual Left has been dead since the 70’s. The Republicans don’t even know how to debate leftists anymore because the Democrats are actually Center Right.Socialism? Forget about it. The term doesn’t even mean what most people thinks it means. In America it’s a pejorative but one used by the mendacious political class to secure their massive tax shelters and perpetual debt schemes.The regular folk don’t trust those political operatives who use terms they don’t actually understand anymore.This hypothetical matchup though is about Trump v Sanders. Trump won’t even bother using socialist as a slur. He doesn’t have a clue what it means and he’s a guy who wants the government to fund all kinds of things. That’s a dead end there.Mocking Bernie’s appearance will backfire because Bernie isn’t in anyway vain but Trump is. Bernie lacks a record that can be attacked, no Benghazi or email scandal. His worst skeleton is a political vacation to Russia after the Soviet collapse and Donald Trump will go out of his way to avoid bringing up Russia in the campaign.Bernie likes to attack billionaires who don’t pay their fair share of taxes and bribe politicians and foster corruption. Giving him Trump as an opponent? That’s like giving ambrosia to a Greek God.Bernie might lose, let’s face reality here but Trump would be so bruised afterward he might not actually recover. A lot of Trump’s win came from districts that are inherently Bernie land. Union Workers, non college grads, angry white guys who just want a little rage in politics.Bernie would face a difficult Congress, worse than Trump or Obama ever had it and that is actually an advantage because a lot of voters will deduce that electing a socialist is not that dangerous in a world where Rand Paul and Mark Meadows are in Congress.I could foresee Bernie doing quite well with the Baby Boomers who will all be retired by then and facing the uncertainties of our Health Care System.He will crush it with the 20 something’s because he’s basically an old cranky hipster. One who has a solid record on defending the 2nd Amendment, thinks college should be cheap if not free and wants low end wages to be raised. He also thinks Congress should quit legislating women’s bodies while refusing to manage Health Care.It all depends on whether he can win the 35–55 year olds. He’s a cranky Jewish revolutionary with a decidedly non pro Israel pattern that might very well be relevant in two years given what Israel, Syria and Iran are up to and that will be a complex and nuanced issue. Trump won as a noninterventionist who wouldn’t get us in another dumb war.

Firstly you have to realize what Trump was. He was a passing fancy, a breeze that endured for just about one second. The only way someone like Trump could have become President is if the opposition was a bunch of loony keystone cops, otherwise known as THE DEMOCRATS. Just think who else would be dumb enough to nominate someone as polarizing and as despised by a large segment of the population as Hillary was and is, except for people that escaped from the loony bin.A year and a half into his presidency Trump has shown his true colors. We knew he was uncouth, we knew he would give the least eloquent speeches of any leader since Atilla the Hun - but what we weren't sure of and what he kept oh so quiet was that he was a true war loving, Napalm smelling, bomb everyone I don’t like kind of neocon!Bernie is the real stuff! An idealist that recognizes Americans bombastic claims to exceptionalism, when in reality the country is exceptional in only being so non exceptional. He knows that in every parameter that counts; reading scores, math competency, longevity, health and oh by the way happiness - we are not even in the top 10! To guys like Trump American Exceptionalism is confined to just one thing; how many bombs we have and how many people we can kill quickly- something we are indeed exceptional at!Bernie wants to ‘rationalize’ the American jungle.

The latter is the governments main program to finance science and medicine. Ask yourself how many have died at the hands of our enemies in the last decade vs how many have died from diseases.

Bernie can ignite the base the way that Obama did but unlike Obama Bernie is much more committed to ideology. Democrat presidents who are effective tend to govern from the Center right of the political spectrum because the administration up until recently has been unable to force the legislative branch into doing as they wish and thus must work with swing state representatives who help moderate how much can reasonably achieved in a legislative session. In 2 years the Democrat May be running against Pence as Mueller has rounded up a staggering number of Trump associates and may be building a case that leads to the resignation or impeachment of the current sitting President. Trumps has managed to keep his base on board in part by working to undermine immigration issues so that he can keep them as he continues to run as an outsider (his backing of Goodlattes bill which failed to get a majority of Republicans on board while undermining Graham’s bill which is effectively being filibustered by Majority senate leadership as it could pass) and a steady stream of frequently inaccuate tweets and a news network who has committed itself to be the Trump propaganda instrument (you know who Ivam talking about) and he keeps the core of his supporters happy.

10,What are the chances that the Democrats will not have a net loss of seats in the Senate in 2018?,2018 Midterm Elections in the United States,U.S. Senate,1!,1!,1!,1!,"So I’ll say this up front: my forecast, which is largely poll-based and accounts for correlated polling errors between states, puts their chances of not losing seats at 26%.One thing you could do is read that link up there to understand where that number comes from. But if you don’t feel like it or don’t believe it, I’ll show you a way to eyeball this with one assumption and only limited information about each state. If you do this, you’ll still come to the conclusion that Republicans’ chances of picking up seats on net are quite good (although note that 26% is about the probability I put on Donald Trump winning the presidency in my final 2016 forecast).The assumption is that all of the Senate races are independent of one another. That is, on election night, even if you know that Michigan and Minnesota are going Republican, as long as no votes have come in from Wisconsin you still have no idea who’ll win there, despite the demographic and political similarities between the three states (Midwestern, fairly white swing states) and the fact that Wisconsin’s a little redder than Minnesota and about as purple as Michigan.This isn’t what I assume in the forecast. But we’ll use it for a quick and dirty approximation.Now we’ll make some very rough statements about individual state probabilities. By my count there are 10 Senate races considered fairly competitive, with neither party considered to have a large advantage. Three—Arizona, Nevada, and Tennessee—are held by Republicans, while the other seven—Florida, Indiana, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio, and West Virginia—are held by Democrats.One thing you could do at this point is try to put individual probabilities, based on polls or something, on Democratic chances on each state. But we don’t want to go through the trouble of compiling averages (and we don’t want to give up when we run into states like Montana that have zero polling) here—we’re doing a rough approximation here. Instead what we’ll do is the following:Assume the rest of the states are safe for the incumbent party, putting 100% probability on the probability that they keep those seats.Assume all ten of these competitive states are pure toss-ups: 50–50 chances for the two parties.Calculate the probability, using a known probability distribution, that Democrats end up with at least 49 seats.So, let’s get to it. Subtracting off the competitive states, Democrats have 42 seats. Since we’ve assumed that all states not on that competitive list are safe, Democrats need to win at least seven of the ten competitive states in order to remain at 49 seats or more. Doesn’t matter if they simply hold onto all their seats or if they lose three of their seats while picking up the Republican-held ones—as long as they win at least seven of those races, they won’t have lost ground on net.As it turns out, since we’ve assumed that the Senate elections are independent events and that the probability of winning any given race is uniformly 50% across the competitive states, the probability distribution for the number of competitive races won by Democrats has been quite well known for centuries. It’s a [math]\text{Binomial}(10,0.5)[/math] distribution, characterized by the following probability mass function:[math]P(X=k)={10\choose k}(0.5)^k(1-0.5)^{10-k}[/math]where [math]X[/math] is the number of competitive seats won by Democrats and [math]k[/math] is an integer between 0 and 10 inclusive. (This distribution is identical to the distribution for the number of tosses of a fair coin out of 10 tosses that land heads.)So all we need to do now is plug in [math]k=7,8,9,10[/math] (since those are the outcomes which result in no net Democratic loss), sum up, and we’ve got the probability. It turns out that the probability we get is 17%.This is lower than the forecast for two reasons:Accounting for error correlation across states (which is what the forecast does but which we didn’t do in our approximation) makes tail or extreme events more likely at the expense of events closer to the middle. Since Democrats hold the large majority of competitive seats, no net Democratic loss is more of an extreme event than a net Democratic loss is, and so allowing for between-state dependence bumps up the probability that they don’t lose seats on net.The 50% approximation is more generous to Republicans than it is to Democrats. In Arizona, Montana, and Ohio the probability that the Democrat wins is probably significantly higher than 50%—it’s not enormous, but it’s more than, say, 70%. So this also leads to an underestimation.Finally, here’s the real probability distribution estimated by the forecast:Red bars indicate net Democratic losses; green bars indicate net Democratic gains; the gray bar indicates zero net change.The red bars add up to 74% of the distribution, meaning that the gray and green bars add up to 26%. It’s very slightly skewed to the left, but given this picture it kinda makes sense that the rough approximation wasn’t too far off from the forecast. And both estimates reflect the simple arithmetic fact that there are a lot of Democratic seats that are at least mildly competitive.",5.4k,65,2.3k,"1,040",1,0

1,What are democratic institutions?,Democratic Institutions,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,What is democratic institutions?Government institutions are democratic only if they are not aristocratic. So public offices with life time appointments are aristocratic and undemocratic. The US Senate is aristocratic and undemocratic because the elected members are not based on districts of equal population like the US Representatives are. The Electoral College is aristocratic and undemocratic because the people do not have a direct vote in selecting the President.Democratic institutions must serve the entire population of a country with equality under the law. The rule of law is only democratic if it includes equality under the law. Autocratic and oligarchic governments might have the rule of law but do not qualify for democracy because they fail to fully ensure equality under the law.The fact that there are rational explanations for many aristocratic institutions does not justify those features for a democracy. Traditional features of a nation or a country are often aristocratic and undemocratic. Every democratic republic has remnants of aristocracy that require time for ultimate abolition. One tough myth of aristocracy that democracy has trouble with is the claim of “safety”. The justification of any aristocratic institution for the sake of safety is a marker for examination and consideration for future abolition.,34,0,104,"1,552",0,0

Victim hood created debt that does not exist in reality, this divides people, makes them angry and creates new groups for leftist exploitation. The Left creates the problems, then offers dialectical materialism to create solutions. Dialectical materialism is the dialect between science and matter and it encompasses the idea that science can one day solve all of the worlds problems and that all problems stem from economics.A perfect example of created divisions is the “White Mans Privilege” and its mythology that it was White Christians that ran the black slave trade. In truth a disproportionally low number of White Christians were involved. It was known as the Jewish Black slave trade during its time. (see E. Michael Jones, Michael Hoffman, Henry Makow, and other scholars)This makes blacks angry at whites and they wish to seek redress, this is happening in South Africa where Whites are being murdered and a genocide will soon occur.The Left says that the Whites stole the land. I say the whites civilized South Africa and brought the Blacks common law. The population of blacks exploded from 2 million consisting of warring tribes to around 40 million living in relative peace under the white mans Common Law.Cultural Marxism is all about destroying ideas like common law and original sin and bringing dialectical materialism to the forefront of human consciousness. Dialectical materialism and its statutory laws will destroy the common law which will leave the people in charge with an purely statutory system of laws that no one will have any basis to criticize. No one will know how to question authority without the common law yardstick from which to make judgements.Does law come from authority or does authority come from law?

Noahide law will be the law for all non Jews. The destruction of the common law, brought about with dialectical materialism will get us there.One final thought: Most people casually throw around the idea that we in the West live in democracies. This belief will get us closer and closer to actual pure democracies. In reality, most of the West lives in republics or constitutional democracy.

The matter would have to be carefully studied and check for any potential legal issues before it was approved, meaning all involved would have “covered their backsides” in case of any blowback if things got out of hand.There are no legal sanctions in the Constitution or US federal law that prevent the FBI or any other federal law enforcement agency from investigating allegations of criminal activity simply because it is occurring inside of a political campaign. While it would be illegal to use any information found to assist another candidate or even an incumbent officeholder, no one seems to be making that allegation. The frankly bizarre complaint is that the FBI had someone investigating potential criminal activity which, by law, is their job. If there was no criminal activity found, then there seems to be nothing to be concerned about.However, President Obama was not as inept or as clumsy as Donald Trump is as there’s no evidence that he actively tried to influence or interfere in any federal investigation of him or his campaign. There also doesn’t seem to have been any investigation of Obama, his cabinet or his campaign; nor have any members of his former cabinet been accused of criminal activity, been under investigation for their roles nor pleaded guilty to federal crimes the way that they have in the current administration. The FBI didn’t insert an investigator or use an insider as an informant because there were no credible allegations of criminal activity.Sooo…unless there was clear and compelling evidence that Barack Obama ordered the FBI to place an “informant” into a political campaign and then misused any of the information that this person gathered, there are no “legal consequences.”IANAL",8.9k,176,34.6k,"20,352",0,0

With no prove.What federal laws (not some made up law you just thought of) were violated???Collusion is not a crime. In no way is this any different than the Chinese meddling, money laundering and collusion during the Clinton years. No interference of the balloting machines, tens of thousands, because Jill Stein’s recount effort proved the only anomaly was the ballots in the Michigan election where appeared that the ballot box in Detroit was stuffed in favor in Hilary Clinton. Notice election officials terminated their investigation at that point, not to reveal Democratic wrong doing.I could write a book about how corrupt Robert Mueller, James Comey and the FBI are and the only thing that Trey Gowdy and Jeff Sessions are doing are protecting the institution of the DOJ and the FBI. It is clear that Stefan Halper was a spy in the Trump campaign and not an informant, he engaged in activity to legitimize the Steele dossier, to legitimize a FISA warrant, to legitimize wire taps, to legitimize Susan Rice’s unmasking of Trump campaign officials like MIke Flynn.Four decades ago, Halper was responsible for along forgotten scandal involving the 1980 election, in which the Reagan campaign – using CIA officials managed by Halper, reportedly under the direction of former CIA Director and then-Vice-Presidential candidate George H.W. Bush – got caught running a spying operation from inside the Carter administration.Reagan campaign spying operation “involved a number of retired Central Intelligence Agency officials and was highly secretive.” The article, by then-NYT reporter Leslie Gelb, added that its “sources identified Stefan A. Halper, a campaign aide involved in providing 24-hour news updates and policy ideas to the traveling Reagan party, as the person in charge.” Halper, now 73, had also worked with Donald Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney, and Alexander Haig as part of the Nixon administration.Halper, through his CIA work, has extensive ties to the Bush family (not suprised). Few remember that the CIA’s perceived meddling in the 1980 election – its open support for its former Director, George H.W. Bush to become President – was a somewhat serious political controversy.So as it turns out, the informant (spy) used by the FBI in 2016 to gather information on the Trump campaign was not some previously unknown, top-secret asset whose exposure as an operative could jeopardize lives. Quite the contrary: his decades of work for the CIA – including his role in an obviously unethical if not criminal spying operation during the 1980 presidential campaign – is quite publicly known.The NYT described the FBI informant (Halper) as “an American academic who teaches in Britain” and who “made contact late that summer with” George Papadopoulos and “also met repeatedly in the ensuing months with the other aide, Carter Page.” NYT described him as what he actually is: “the informant is well known in Washington circles, having served in previous Republican administrations and as a source of information for the C.I.A. in past years.”From FBI file: The professor who met with both Page and Papadopoulos is Stefan Halper, a former official in the Nixon, Ford and Reagan administrations who has been a paid consultant to an internal Pentagon think tank known as the Office of Net Assessment, consulting on Russia and China issues, according to public records. Then there are questions about what appear to be some fairly substantial government payments to Halper throughout 2016. Halper continues to be listed as a “vendor” by the federal government to private contractors.",288,4,17,58,0,0

Remember when Trump threw a tantrum over the ‘illegal’ FBI surveillance of Carter Page? Do you remember how that came about, and what was required to put it into place?Put bluntly: such investigations must first be triggered on the basis of evidence collected (not merely allegations made), such that it’s shown that there’s solid reason to believe that a crime has taken place, and surveillance would enable the FBI/DOJ to accumulate evidence that would enable it to be prosecuted in court. To do this, the initial evidence has to at least be put before a Federal Judge (who will then sign off on the surveillance warrants), or in the cases of more extreme surveillance (as in the case of the FISA warrants), put before a court, which then determines whether there is a need for surveillance, and who then authorise it.Trump, as usual, presents absolutely no evidence that any of this has taken place. If it happened, there would be documentation proving that it did. There would be formal authorisation for such surveillance, and (more importantly), for that authorisation to have been given, there would be evidence of wrongdoing put before a Federal Judge. What Trump doesn’t realise is that he’s admitting that there’s a basis for such: by suggesting that the FBI have ‘planted’ someone for the purposes of such surveillance, he’s admitting that the FBI (and the courts) had good reason to do so. Oops.In reality, that’s not what’s happened. I suspect that the ‘informant’ that has provided intelligence to the FBI originally came forward voluntarily, as would be typical for that sort of issue. They have worked inside the Trump operation, have recognised wrongdoing, and have effectively served as a ‘whistleblower’, providing information to the FBI of his own volition. That doesn’t mean that the FBI planted him there: it means that he came forward and offered to provide the FBI intelligence. That’s a very different kettle of fish.This one’s just yet another attempt by Trump to play the victim of a system that he feels has turned against him (gee, can’t imagine why!), but once again fails to recognise that it simply wouldn’t work the way he suggests. Worse, he’s failed once again to provide any evidence to back up his assertions: it’s all bluster and false indignation, and none of it reinforced by documentary evidence (which would exist were it the case).And, of course, it’s all Obama’s fault. If it wasn’t, it’d surely be a plot by the Deep State (run, naturally, by Hillary Clinton) to gather intelligence on stuff that Trump claims didn’t happen, and has no reason to worry about.Cue eye roll…",9.6k,354,1.4k,"1,931",0,0
6,What are the legal consequences if Barack Obama was involved in planting Stefan Halper as an FBI informant into Donald Trump’s presidential campaign?,Democratic Party (US politics),Barack Obama (politician),1!,1!,1!,1!,"The legal consequences of conspiracy and abuse of power in directing and conducting illegal espionage on an opposing political party, let alone the abuse of power, conspiracy and obstruction of justice committed in order to undermine the administration of a duly-elected president, are very serious, regardless of whether or not Obama is ultimately shown to have been knowledgeable of, to say nothing of directing the effort. Those consequences would arguably affect anyone knowingly involved with the unlawful surveillance effort.Contrary to what the Obama apologists in the progressive left are seeking to suggest in other answers to this question, the issue is not that the FBI and CIA spied on the Trump campaign (and subsequently, the Trump administration) merely to investigate attempts by Russian operatives “to influence the outcome of a presidential election”, let alone the bogus claims of “suspected criminal activity” of members of the Trump campaign (e.g., Carter Page and George Papadopoulos) in supposed unlawful “collusion” with those operatives. Making the latter claim with a straight face is amazing enough, given the many months during which Obama apologists have rabidly denied any such spying took place, and even attacked Trump for suggesting he’d been “wiretapped”). Ironically, as all the emerging evidence now shows, the “attempt to” influence the outcome of a presidential election” was in fact orchestrated and attempted by none other than the Obama administration, in order to spy on the Trump campaign to prevent his election, and in the event the unimaginable happened, to cripple his presidency.But I digress. The issue is that the illegal spying on the Trump campaign by the Obama administration, began months before the FBI and CIA began fabricating the “Russian collusion” narrative. and used illegally-obtained FISA warrants (through the use of a widely-discredited, Clinton-funded opposition-research screed, the Steele Dossier) to pursue and justify that espionage. These activities all came long after deep state operatives in the FBI and CIA had hired and coordinated with Russian and British intelligence operatives in an attempt to entrap vulnerable campaign officials in the Trump orbit (i.e., Papadopoulos, Page, Don Trump Jr.) - attempts which were not only demonstrably unsuccessful, but which further involved legal communications between the targets and the intelligence operatives seeking to entrap them, which had no relationship to the alleged misbehavior.This is why deep-state operatives in the Obama administration (including Comey, McCabe, Brennan, Clapper, Yates, Strzok-Page, and of course Obama himself), and its many compliant, complicit and complacent lapdogs in the Democrat media, are trying so desperately to conceal, obscure, obstruct, deflect, distort and distract from precisely when the initial, supposed triggering event (call it Event Zero) in the Trump surveillance effort took place, and which supposedly justified the initiation and pursuit of that surveillance effort - since this would (a) expose the actual (and thus illegal) nature of the surveillance effort which began months before that date, as well as (b) show that there was no probable cause of any criminal activity within the Trump campaign that would justify such surveillance. That in fact, the much-touted “probable cause” was manufactured rather than monitored.Thus the one critical question to be answered, has three parts: (a) precisely when the Obama administration first began using the “Russian Collusion” narrative, (b) how this coincided with the date on which they began their surveillance efforts on the Trump campaign, and (c) what specific probable cause (if any) for that surveillance existed at the time,. There are many excellent analyses of the surrounding events, but this one does an excellent job of demonstrating the ensuing investigation’s inarguably lawless and utterly political genesis:The Real Origination Story of the Trump-Russia InvestigationIt’s especially interesting to consider this information in conjunction with the NY Times recent efforts to socialize the Obama administrations cover story to justify that espionage, which is both referenced and summarized hereAs the Dossier Scandal Looms, the New York Times Struggles to Save Its Collusion TaleWhat makes all this even more interesting is what the apologists for the “Russian-Collusion” narrative refer to as the “Kremlin-linked Maltese professor named Joseph Mifsud” who originally approached Papadopolous with supposed dirt on Hillary Clinton. Though no “dirt” was ever negotiated or delivered, this meeting was later followed up by a meeting between Papadopolous and Australian diplomat Alexander Downer (a meeting initiated by the latter), where Paoadopolous mentioned his earlier meeting with Mifsud. The latter meeting is what the FBI say was the event which triggered their investigation (i.e., Event Zero in Trump Spygate) that supposedly began in “late July 2016”. Even though the Spygate apologists are treating Mifsud as a “dangerous Russian intelligence asset” whose contact with Papadopolous supposedly justified unwarranted surveillance on the Trump Campaign, the FBI interviewed Mifsud weeks after his meeting with Papadopolous, and subsequently released him with no action. Further, Mifsud’s history shows him to be much more closely linked with western intelligence as well as the Clinton Foundation in particular, than with Russia. The full story is presented here.The overwhelming evidence points to a sting operation orchestrated by the Obama administration, to push potentially damaging into the Trump orbit to be picked up by Trump officials, and then used as justification for initiating surveillance on the Trump Campaign, as well as the justification for the unbounded, open-ended “countersurveillance” investigation demanded by Democrat political operatives, and currently being conducted by Mueller, all without any probable cause or evidence of any criminal wrongdoing (by the Trump campaign, at least)I look forward to cheering (OK, make that jeering) the participants in the forthcoming orange jumpsuit parade - preferably all at the same time.",673,18,50,370,0,5

If certain techniques, such as wiretaps, were employed there would need to be valid warrants or orders here as well. It appears that such orders were sought and legally obtained in this particular investigation.If such legally executed investigation failed surface any wrongdoing, the FBI would pretty much just move on to the next investigation. Many law enforcement investigations do not result in further action.

Will a new democratization wave be in the near future?",Democratization,Liberal Democratic Politicians (USA politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"First, I want to apologize for taking so long to respond. You have asked a very profound question and I have been mulling the issues I am acquainted with to give you the best answer I can.First, no country in my estimation is “totally democratic”. Humans seem innately given a drive for power, domination of others and other crimes against their perceived enemies. Such corruption exists in the democracies that are close to the ideals of having every citizen treated equally under the law, protect minority rights, and conduction elections that have 2 or more competing candidates and are conducted fairly, with votes being tallied accurately. Therefore no country is without corruption, but democratic republican governments are generally better at finding out about corruption and bringing the corrupters to justice.Freedom House which ranks countries according to whether all citizens can exercise their political rights (electoral choice of competing candidates and election fairness) and also on being able to exercise their civil liberties such as freedom of speech, press, fairness of court system etc. I would argue that no country can achieve total perfection, that perfection is a ideal to be aspired to and worked for.Having said this, there are several institutions that measure and rank countries’ relative freedom with regard to political rights and civil liberties. My preference is Freedom House because it does distinguish between political rights and civil liberties while other rankings are one dimensional.The website ranking countries in 2017 is found at https://freedomhouse.org/sites/d...The rankings are at the end of the report. As you will see a number of Muslim countries are at least partly democratic. May more join them. Countries have to work toward becoming more democratic. You may notice that the Muslim countries that becoming more democratic are the countries more tolerant of other cultures and religions. Any steps toward this ideal will enhance the chances for becoming democratic republics for if all citizens are regarded as equal, minorities must be protected and afforded equal rights. Muslim leaders and citizens who are tolerant will find the path of greater liberty for all.The United States was fortunate to be colony of the British, who had achieved a fairly high degree of democracy in their country. The Founders of our Republic were extremely well educated and wanted the US to be a democratic republic and constructed a Constitution to do so. However, the Founders could not end the evil practice of slavery and the evils of discrimination against other minorities. They did understand citizens should be able to modify the Constitution, so after the bitter Civil War, the Constitution freed former slaves and granted them full citizenship. This positive change was still accompanied by the evils of discrimination against minorities. Indeed, the white majority in the South created laws that subjugated African Americans by preventing them from voting and segregating them in public places and businesses. President Eisenhower began the true end of such discrimination by aiding them in voting. He also enforced the Supreme Court’s decision to integrate the schools. His successes were crowned with Lyndon Johnson’s Civil Rights 1964 legislation preventing businesses from not serving a person due to race, ethnicity or nationality. Americans, I believe, are quite justified in celebrating how far we have come in giving citizens equal treatment, but as you can see or knew, it was not an overnight victory. It was YEARS of two steps forward and one step back. For that we cannot be proud.I know there are many devout Muslims who know Islam is perfectly compatible with democracy. One whom I support is Dr. Mohamad Zuhdi Jasser who is the President & Founder of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy (AIFD).

In the second case, his “schtick” has clearly started to wear thin and the electorate in general have grown tired of him.

4,"How can left libertarianism exist? Surely, the two ideologies are mutually exclusive.",Exclusive,Exclusivity,Libertarianism (politics),1!,1!,1!,"Left isn’t an ideology - it’s the metaphorical side or end of a given spectrum.In traditional left-right ideological divisions, left is more about community, and right is more about individualism.And so, “right libertarianism” (i.e. right wing) is what most Americans think of as “libertarianism” - privatization of everything, little or no government, and individual and individual rights being paramount, no matter what.Left libertarianism is also about little or no government, but based around self-governing communities, rather than self-governing individuals, only.The thinking among left-libertarians is that societies require social models - i.e. governance that accounts for the fact that there’s more than one person’s views to consider.However, its hallmark axiom is that all authority, in order to be valid, must be able to justify itself.And so, for instance, an agricultural collective might be granted the authority by its members to vote on matters that affect the collective as a whole, or even to have a ruling council that makes decisions for it, and so on.The key aspect of that authority being that it is granted by individual members, and can be taken away by them, as well.And so, right libertarianism is about as little external authority as possible, centering around the individual, and his or her ownership rights.Left libertarianism is about as little external authority as possible, centering around communities whose members have agreed to be part of that community, and have agreed regarding the limits of that community’s authority.Presumably, the questioner associates “Left” with “more authoritarian”, and so, sees the ideologies as being mutually exclusive - but per the explanation above, that’s not the case regarding left libertarianism, aka anarchism (in the philosophical sense of that term).“Anarchism is, in my view, basically a kind of tendency in human thought which shows up in different forms in different circumstances, and has some leading characteristics. Primarily it is a tendency that is suspicious and skeptical of domination, authority, and hierarchy.It seeks structures of hierarchy and domination in human life over the whole range, extending from, say, patriarchal families to, say, imperial systems, and it asks whether those systems are justified. It assumes that the burden of proof for anyone in a position of power and authority lies on them. Their authority is not self-justifying. They have to give a reason for it, a justification.And if they can’t justify that authority and power and control, which is the usual case, then the authority ought to be dismantled and replaced by something more free and just. And, as I understand it, anarchy is just that tendency. It takes different forms at different times.Anarcho-syndicalism is a particular variety of anarchism which was concerned primarily, though not solely, but primarily with control over work, over the work place, over production. It took for granted that working people ought to control their own work, its conditions, [that] they ought to control the enterprises in which they work, along with communities, so they should be associated with one another in free associations, and … democracy of that kind should be the foundational elements of a more general free society.”~Noam ChomskySource: Noam Chomsky: The Kind of Anarchism I Believe in, and What's Wrong with LibertariansNOTE: The “what’s wrong with libertarians” part of that interview refers to right-libertarians, where Chomsky says the following:“That kind of libertarianism, in my view, in the current world, is just a call for some of the worst kinds of tyranny, namely unaccountable private tyranny. Anarchism is quite different from that. It calls for an elimination to tyranny, all kinds of tyranny. Including the kind of tyranny that’s internal to private power concentrations. So why should we prefer it? Well I think because freedom is better than subordination. It’s better to be free than to be a slave. It's better to be able to make your own decisions than to have someone else make decisions and force you to observe them. I mean, I don’t think you really need an argument for that. It seems like … transparent.”Source (also) - Noam Chomsky: The Kind of Anarchism I Believe in, and What's Wrong with LibertariansChomsky’s view is that the ownership-centricity and individual-centricity of right-libertarianism can actually create tyranny - because only the owners have the power.And so, what Chomsky sees as tyranny, right-libertarians see as the free for individuals to do as they please.What right-libertarians see as sacrificing freedom to the authority of a group, Chomsky and other left-libertarians see the given group as a container for preserving freedom for the group’s members.",319,4,2.4k,"1,627",0,2

Surely, the two ideologies are mutually exclusive.",Exclusive,Exclusivity,Libertarianism (politics),1!,1!,1!,"The iterations of libertarianism I've seen (and there are always going to be different versions of any given ideology or political system, so it’s tough to generalize) tend to be heavily focused on the supposed virtue of self-sufficiency. In a vacuum, that model seems positive — you get to do your thing your own way, lead your life according to your own principles, love who you choose, and so on — and maybe you're growing your own food, and building your own house, too (some libertarians get really into that part). All without the imposition of a centralized government (or much of a government at all). It's a “live and let live” type thing, they say. And it's good for everyone, because everyone is free.However, you’re not free in this kinda Mad Max world if you for instance depend on government welfare to survive. One problem with libertarianism, anarchism, and any small/no-government system, is that it doesn't seem to account for the fact that government, for all the bad it can do, also has the means to implement and maintain massive social systems like health care, public transportation, and education. If your government is going right — and people will argue what “right” means — your government is covering your medications, subsidizing your housing, and keeping the buses running. In a small government world, what happens to the people who need all those supports? In a self-sufficient libertarian system, are expensive medications being produced and covered? If not, people will die. I think libertarians understand this but either don't want to discuss it because it's uncomfortable, or they simply don't care. They think it's natural selection. In reality it's monstrously inhumane.The counter argument is usually “Well, we'll all look after each other, community to community”. That’s a nice idea. In whose vegetable garden are the immunosuppresants and high grade painkillers being manufactured? Is Farmer John asking a reasonable price for them? Because if he's the only one who's figured out how to grow them from his tomato seeds I'm thinking he's definitely going to jack up the prices a bit.And no, I know libertarianism is not primitivism. You'll keep your solar panels and tractors and maybe even the trains and airplanes. But if the idea is to diminish or dismantle big government, you'll also be diminishing and dismantling the systems disabled, ill, and otherwise vulnerable people rely on to literally stay alive.

Classical liberalism is actually a lot closer to modern American libertarianism with its belief that the government should not interfere in free markets and welfare, on the whole, is bad for society.But, history has shown us that much of this bunk. After multiple economic depressions, specifically the crash of the markets in the 1930’s liberalism was able to adapt. This is best summed up in the words of Arthur Schlesinger Jr.:When the growing complexity of industrial conditions required increasing government intervention in order to assure more equal opportunities, the liberal tradition, faithful to the goal rather than to the dogma, altered its view of the state. [...] There emerged the conception of a social welfare state, in which the national government had the express obligation to maintain high levels of employment in the economy, to supervise standards of life and labor, to regulate the methods of business competition, and to establish comprehensive patterns of social security.So, modern American liberalism is at odds with classical liberalism in terms of specific proposals.

Progressives see progressivism as an attitude towards the world of politics that is broader than conservatism vs. liberalism, and as an attempt to break free from what they consider to be a false and divisive dichotomy.” John Halpin, Center for American Progress.American progressives tend to support international economics; they advocate progressive taxation and oppose the growing influence of corporations. Progressives are in agreement on an international scale with left-liberalism in that they support organized trade and labor unions; they usually wish to introduce a living wage, and they often support the creation of a universal healthcare system. Yet progressives tend to be more concerned with environmentalism than mainstream liberals.

We will address the backlog of deferred maintenance in our four key public land management agencies. And we will protect public health and safety by modernizing drinking and wastewater systems.

Most Dems favor a single payer healthcare system if there was a political pathway.

Dems want restrictions on certain kinds of firearms and greater requirements for all gun owners, while the GOP is captive to a portion of their base which opposes virtually any regulation of gun ownership.

If you even want to go back to his origins as the mobbed-up trust-fund brat of a racist slumlord — it’s hard not to feel like there’s a reason the word “animals” rolls so easily off his tongue when talking about brown people.Meanwhile, find me once instance where Trump called a WHITE murderer an “animal”. A white supremacist ran Heather Heyer over with his car, and Trump felt the need to go on TV and remind us that most white supremacists were “fine people” who were just there to appreciate a statue (dedicated to the treasonous regime that wanted to continue to own black people as property). He even called the Confederacy “our heritage”… very confusing considering he’s a New Yorker.AT BEST, he’s being lazy and hand-waving the difference between the relatively miniscule portion of illegal immigrants that are actually gang members and the vast majority that are peaceful people who just came here to try and find a better life. And I think that’s the other thing — saying we should accept the distinction between MS-13 and other immigrants asks for more nuance than Trump’s own immigration policies offer.

That has been happening since the day Donald Trump first took the podium and began assaulting truth with specious lies about Hillary Clinton that were not only unsubstantiated, but defied actual bipartisan investigations that found no criminal intent or action.But that hasn’t stopped Trump from continuing to claim that anyone who challenges should be “locked up” while himself denying clear and conspicuous coverups of people actually indicted for crimes who advised and collaborated with Trump on many fronts.He’s a criminal waiting to be exposed. But in order to avoid that fate, he simultaneously refuses to be honest about his own dealings during the campaign or his presidency. His conflicts of interest alone are reason enough to raise suspicions about his motivations and conduct in office.So they’ve ceased caring about the rule of law, as evidenced by the lawless fabricator Rudy Giuliani, whom Trump sent out like a dog foaming at the mouth to clear the path for Trump to walk through…and (in his dreams) assume the mantle he would choose to abide. That of the first American dictator.They are accusing Obama of this FBI mole “thing” (it’s made up…) because it appeals to an equally rabid base that has been taught to hate the man whom they in turn blame for their own miserably racist, selfish, intractably small-minded worldview in which intelligence is called conspiracy, and science a lie.But those memes play big among the 40% who constitute the Neo-Confederacy of Trumpism. So they’ll buy the whole “Obama mole” story and threaten civil war if Trump is held accountable in any way. This is propaganda, pure and simple. It follows the pattern of every fascist pogrom in history.If anything, the FBI had absolute cause to infiltrate a campaign in which Trump openly, publicly and aggressively stated that he wanted Russia to interfere in our election. There is nothing secret about any of this. It’s all hiding in plain sight.Trump deserves to be impeached, but the GOP doesn’t have the guts or the character to acknowledge the truth.

This is not Russia or Nazi Germany.Yet.Donald Trump wants it to be his, which is why if he asked Comey if Comey was loyal to him. Comey couldn’t answer that question in a way that satisfied Trump. Trump also wanted Comey to let the investigation on Michael Flynn go. Comey: Trump Asked For 'Loyalty,' Wanted Him To 'Let' Flynn Investigation 'Go' Because Comey insisted on doing his job, Trump fired him.Get it?You can say what you want, but despite Trumps denials, the facts stand.

It is called dementia. But since Trump had a doctor sign a statement Trump crafted himself to affirm how very healty he is that can’t be it, can it? Trump’s Doctor Says President Wrote His Own Glowing Medical Report — and Twitter Says 'Duh'.The fact is the informant was following a suspected Russia agent who ingratiated himself into the Trump campaign which duly and rightly alarmed the FBI who is charged with protecting the internal security of the nation.

Just ask him.) he would thank the FBI for their deligence and their concern for his safety and the security of his nation.He was not and he does not. Instead he castigates the FBI, and does whatever he can to discredit them, thereby making it look likes he has something to hide.If Donald Trump is not paranoid or suffering from dementia, the only conclusion that you can make from his allegations is that he does, indeed have something to hide.Apparently he’s not as smart as he thinks he is, because when you lay down with dogs, you wake up with fleas.As far as what Barack Obama knew or didn’t knew, and what was presented to him in his inches thick daily briefing (no bullet points here) we don’t know, because he is a man of intelligence, discretion and fairness who would not torpedo his party or his nation’s election by telling America what he did know, which you can take with his meeting with Mitch McConnell was quite a lot. Obama official says Mitch McConnell 'watered down' Russia warning in 2016. And if you don’t get that Obama was thinking of the nation by him seeking a bipartisan response to Russian meddling, then you really don’t understand that Obama was a much better president than Trump can aspire to be. Obama put the efficient working of the government and the nation ahead of party. If he wanted to hand Secretary Clinton the election, then he could have ignored McConnell and spilled everything.But no. He wanted the integrity of the US electoral process to stand. He wanted to preserve a two-party system that provided a range of responses to the diifferent problems we faced. He believes in this country, its government and the American people doing the right thing.Stop trying to ascribe partisan politics and criminal intent to Obama’s actions.

But Democrats and Republicans are political sellouts who care deeply about what the common man thinks. They tailor their policies to the majorities. They shift subtly (or in Trump’s case, not so subtly) in their positions from election to election to stake out the middle of the political field.

Our system of voting does not allow us to form coalitions through our leadership, and puts the burden of coalition forming on the voter themselves. That’s an unfair ask for people who also have to work jobs and go to the grocery store and raise kids. We should be both able to vote for somebody we believe in and get the results we desire.But when people complain about the “two party system” and you drill down to their real position, it’s because they secretly think everyone agrees with them and is just ignorant that there are other options. Libertarians think that most of the country would be libertarian if only the Libertarian Party could get some airtime. Greens think that Democrats are able to pretend towards liberalism, and the media lets them get away with it. In reality, you get corporate, run-of-the-mill politicians because people don’t want to smash the state. They want what we’ve got, but a little different. Most people aren’t libertarians.

I would say in defense of wealthy entrepreneurs that they are often the ones who develop new technologies (often with government, or taxpayer subsidies) and new businesses that enrich out lives. But the price we pay is that far too many of them get drunk with their power and feel a sense of entitlement to their vast wealth. I am not a religious person, but I find the Christian teaching that the more money and power one has the more energy they spend to protect and defend it. And that is pretty much what they are doing by essentially owning one entire party and a good portion of the other. At a time when more and more families are finding it difficult to raise the money to send their kids to college; when health insurance and decent health care is unavailable to and getting obscenely expensive for many in the middle and lower classes; when teachers in many states are grotesquely underpaid and schools are underfunded, just to name a few serious problems in America, what does the GOP do that now controls a majority of State governorships and legislatures, both houses of the US Congress and the Presidency? They pass a tax cut bill that bulldozes money up to the top 1% and trigger the growth of the deficit to $1 trillion.The United States wrested power away from a corporate and financial elite after the end of the Great Depression. And of course, when FDR attached the Plutocrats and decided to raise taxes and create government programs to address the massive unemployment and underemployment of American citizens, the wealthy accused him of being a Communist and implementing policies that would “destroy the American spirit.” There is nothing mysterious about what is happening here. Lord Acton said it best when he admonished that “Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.” It is just that, as George Santayana so famously said, “Those who are ignorant of history are doomed to repeat its mistakes.” And not a small part of this can be laid on the doorstep of an educational system that does not put a high priority on teaching US Government or Civics.So, in response to your question I would have to say that, on balance, the financial and corporate elites have probably done more damage than good. We are currently witnessing a determined and serious attack on our nation's institutions by the rich and powerful.

The clause was originally akin to the Equal Protection clause.Together, they meant that all laws and government infrastructure had to apply to all people; and all people must be treated the same under the law.In fact, I believe it was Franklin (or Jefferson) who lamented, “If the public realizes they can vote themselves wealth from the Treasury, that will be the end of the republic.” (Paraphrasing)Well look what the left has accomplished so far to that end!

In reality most Federal tax revenue comes from “the rich” and “Big Business” (this is also true at State level in such States as New York and California), half the population of the United States pay little to the Federal government, and most American government spending is on the various benefits created by the New Deal and (especially) the Great Society of the 1960s - these schemes started off very small but have expanded and expanded and expanded. This money does not tend to go to “the wealthy”.So you are wrong both on the tax side of the Federal government and the spending side of the Federal government - the “big donors and their lobbyists” have not determined American Federal government tax or spending policy over the decades. Nor are they responsible for most of the REGULATIONS the Federal government has saturated society with over the last 80 years or so. What the lobbyists have done is tweak the details of regulations to be less harmful to their clients - although I doubt they have achieved nearly as much as they claim when they are trying to get people to pay them (“it would be so much worse if it was not for our work, you would all go bankrupt - now give us some more money or the sky will fall upon you”).Lastly (but perhaps most importantly) the American Republic was set up with very different intentions from yours Sir. It was not set up to “respond to the needs of the non wealthy” or to the “needs” of anyone else - it was created as a LIMITED government (try looking at the Tenth Amendment of the Bill of Rights) with the “common defence and general welfare” being the PURPOSE of the specific and limited power given to the Congress by the Article One, Section Eight of the Constitution of the United States. There was never supposed to be a catch-all “general welfare spending power” (the sort of thing you believe in Sir) and “regulate interstate commerce” was supposed to mean make commerce regular over state lines (establish free trade among the United States) NOT the control of production and sale of goods and services by the Federal Government (which was only established by some Supreme Court Judgements during World War II - for example the judgement that declared the Feds could tell a farmer what to grow and what to sell on-his-own-farm).Essentially your question reflects assumptions that might be best described as “vulgar Marxism” - the sort of mindset that dominates media types (especially entertainment media types) and leftist academics and teachers.

If the schism between her and Bernie Sanders hadn’t led many younger voters to stay home or vote third party, she’d have won comfortably.What has hurt the Democrats is cozying up to Wall Street, moving to the center and ignoring their base, gerrymandering, and, frankly, racial resentment.Michael Tesler, a political scientist at UC Irvine, has spent the year studying the role of race in the campaign. In a series of articles, he has described survey data that show a strong link between measures of racial resentment and support for Trump among white voters.[1]Given that they’re currently ahead by 50–39 in the generic Congressional ballot (PPP poll, 5/15/18) and have won or at least significantly outperformed 2016 election results in special elections all over the country (hi, Senator Doug Jones), they seem to have figured at least some of this out.Never underestimate the ability of the Democrats to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory, but right now they’re on a roll and have the wind at their backs.Footnotes[1] Clinton won as many votes as Obama in 2012 — just not in the states where she needed them most",49,1,543,"4,378",0,2

The Clintons specifically formed the Democratic Leadership Council in the 80s to accomplish exactly that. Even still, they perform well as a percentage of the popular vote.Their biggest problem is the urban/rural divide. Hot-button issues, especially gun control, ignite a fire of hatred against urban liberals trying to force others into their worldview. It drives Republicans turnout far more than Republican candidates themselves. When Dems said, ""I'm not sure about Trump""…rural conservatives liked him a bit. When they fought him…they voted for him. When they protested against him…if word got out that he wanted oral pleasure, millions of evangelical white men would shove their wives out of the way so they could get there first, lol.Trump has spent five decades screwing everyone he came into contact with, from customers to business partners. He has abandoned wives (and girlfriends) like last year's sport coats. He didn't particularly care about his own children until they were useful adults to him. He sneered at poor people in his own autobiography. The idea that he would do anything at all to help regular Americans he doesn't even know is outright laughable.Still, they love him…because Democrats hate him.When Americans say they dislike negative politics, they're lying through their teeth. They LOVE the bloodsport; negative campaigning is our government form of Olympics. Trump feeds that like a master zookeeper; when he said, ""I could shoot an innocent man on the streets of New York in broad daylight and not lose a single vote""…sadly…he was probably right.The bitter partisanship compounds it. Democrats didn't invent identity politics; it's been a growing issue for decades. In the sixties and seventies, races were hard to call in the days before an election, because lots of states were swing states. Even up to 1984, when Reagan carried 49 states, that proves many millions of Democrats were willing to vote Republican, even for the highest office. You don't really see that anymore; if you know someone's party affiliation, you automatically know their exact viewpoint on a thousand separate subjects, and can predict with uncanny accuracy who they will vote for twenty years into the future. All they need is the Party identifier. Cult leaders marvel at the loyalty generated by Republicans and Democrats, especially the Republicans. The identity politics isn't pro-LGBT, or feminist, or minority; it's ""moral conservative Republican"" labeling that drives people to the polls.It's a bizarre situation where pushing more evidence only drives the jury further away. Even now, there are calls everywhere to end the Mueller investigation, even though it has netted 19 arrests, a half-dozen ""Guilty"" pleas, and the suspects have turned state's witness…yet I haven't met a single Trump supporter who has backed down.Obama was often derogatorily referred to as the ""Democrat Messiah"", but the Dems harshly criticized him over war, bailouts, compromising over single-payer healthcare, the Trans Pacific Partnership, pipelines…but I haven't seen a Republican criticize their party leadership in decades, all the way back to Ross Perot's supporters in 1992.At this point, the best tactic for resistance might be to NOT resist: speak all they want, but when it comes time to vote…all Democrats in DC walk out of the Capitol.

This is done my moving the boundaries so that your party get a majority in more districts, and the other party gets a HUGE majority in one district. In some cases, the courts have intervened and forced a redistricting.Take a look at these districts. They should be squares. The odd shapes are not drawn because of and strange geography, but because of the party affiliation of the voters.Another form of tampering was to introduce new “voter identification” rules specifically designed to inhibit groups likely to vote Democrat. Seven GOP-controlled states have enacted such rules.There is also evidence that election offices were hacked to disable registration processing. This is an indirect way to impair voting by groups they didn’t want to vote.

In 1860, according to the Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History, 75 percent of white families in the United States owned not a single slave, while 1 percent of families owned 40 or more. [Source]. The majority of “whites” also did not work harmoniously together for most of North American history. It’s like the British and French ever clashed or anything. And Poles were warmly welcomed everywhere they went and got along fabulously with Italians who warmly welcomed their Chinese neighbors and there was never a need for Little Italys and Chinatowns which were exclusionary slums. Nope. “White people” have always immediately worked harmoniously to keep black people down and never ever worked against other “whites”, only ever to keep black people down. Clearly.It completely ignores Britain, France and Spain’s creation of the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade in favor of basically pretending that the United States invented it and bears 100% blame and responsibility for it. When was the last time anyone inside or outside of Spain or France talked about slavery reparations? I’ve never read or heard a single thing about that. You cannot hold a country accountable for things that happened before said country even existed. Slavery as a legalized institution existed in the country of the United States between 1776 and 1865 when the 13th amendment was passed. A mere 89 years which is the blink of an eye if you read anything about other historical instances of slavery which often exist in legalized form inside one singular country for hundreds of years. Anything before 1776 is on the three countries that came, set up colonies and territories and conquered portions of Africa.The size of Union forces in January 1863 totaled over 600,000 [Source], the vast majority were “white.” Refer back to my second point. The vast majority of these soldiers never had a single slave and tens of thousands died horrific, painful, slow, agonizing deaths to end slavery elsewhere. Holding “whites” responsible completely negates the bravery and selflessness of those 600,000 men. Millions of Americans are descended from them. Still responsible?And quite frankly, even when it comes to the Confederate army it’s still pretty lazy and historically inaccurate to say that 100% of the soldiers were “fighting for slavery.” Even in the most slave-heavy states, you’re still looking at around half the state’s population NOT having slaves. How responsible are you for what goes on on the opposite end of your state right now? How easy is it for you — even with all your wealth and education and technology — to get laws changed for the better in your state today? Hard, isn’t it? Then why do you think an essentially peasant farmer in Alabama or Georgia with little to no education, no technology was any more powerful or capable of ending slavery in their states? But no, better to simply pretend that every single person south of the Mason-Dixon line lived on a sprawling hundred acre plantation, had 10+ slaves and fought the war purely to continue the slavery tradition. It’s not like conscription and substitutions were things….It also plays into the obnoxious victimhood narrative of today. I adore history. I think it’s the most important subject anyone could learn about. But there is a difference between learning about history…and taking it on yourself as though it happened, today, to you personally and thus you personally are now owed something because of what happened [maybe] to your [maybe] great great great great great great grandfather who is long dead by other people who are also long dead. Yet somehow now 250 years after the fact you’re owed something by people who had nothing to do with it. Yeah, that’s good logic that’s going to carry you far in life.",2.2k,66,185,759,0,5
4,Will white America ever be forgiven for slavery?,History of Slavery,Slavery,Logic (philosophy),1!,1!,1!,"Certainly not while such ignorant, uninformed stereotypes still exist. Next thing, you’ll be telling me the War of Northern Aggression was about slavery. First of all, ‘white people’ (whatever that means) did not invent slavery. Slavery was endemic, everywhere - it was the way the world worked until just a couple hundred years ago. Yes , the Danes, Vikings and Angles took slaves from their defeated enemies - but so did everyone else. That was how life worked for everyone around the world. For black slaves, it was predominantly black slavers on the African coast that captured and traded blacks from all over Africa. I certainly don’t owe them a thing - why should I?In America, when someone dies owing a debt, the debt dies with them. There are also mechanisms like bankruptcy and statute of limitations that would certainly have affected claims anyone might have had regarding compensation for past injustices. Most of all, any debts of that sort would have been owed by those that contracted them - not by innocent unrelated people hundreds of years later.Finally, never ever think Lincoln freed the slaves - he didn’t, nor did he want to. You want to thank anyone for ending slavery thank Eli Whitney. He invented the cotton gin and made slavery uneconomical, which is why it ended. Our current setup is much better - after our drudge workers are all used up we can just fire them instead of being responsible for their upkeep and retirement.",551,10,5,81,0,0
4,Will white America ever be forgiven for slavery?,History of Slavery,Slavery,Logic (philosophy),1!,1!,1!,"Good question! One that I pondered until I realized it was an exercise in futility.I came to the realization (through observation and logic) that those who “blame whitey” thrive on being a victim. A victim isn’t responsible for what happens to them and that’s precisely why a “welfare state” exists and why Democrats are so hell bent on socialist ideas.The Democratic Party is the party of the KKK, along with other lesser known hate groups. You could even go so far as to say the DP is a hate group also, BUT they operate under the guise of “helping the disenfranchised”, probably just like some slave owners thought they were helping their slaves by giving them a house in exchange for their work. The DP demonizes the GOP, their members and constituents go right along with it. The thing that KILLS me is seeing a person of color rave about “so and so is the best because X”, to which I reply that the party is descendants of slave owners and most of its key officials stand to make a tidy profit, of which they’ll receive none.Huh?Yea… That’s my thoughts EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.As far as forgiveness goes, I ask what is it that I’ve done to need forgiveness for? I, nor anyone in my family, have ever owned/been for owning another human. My family came to America from Germany in the late 1800s, and settled in Indiana. I have no disdain or dislike for minorities, I have a dislike for undue blame and willful ignorance. The DP has, throughout its existence, ingrained the need for the government to have a teat one could suckle for sustenance, if they were the right color. In reality, it’s a very clever way to keep the minority down and them on top.So, when confronted with a willfully ignorant, hell bent on blaming me for whatever the flavor of the month is, I just ask one question; Didn’t Egypt use slaves from the Caucus mountains when building the pyramids thousands of years ago? (They did)I’m usually met with a response such as “That wasn’t me man! That was thousands of years ago!”To which I reply, “Well, slavery wasn’t me man! That was hundreds of years ago!”It also doesn’t help other African tribes sold their enemies to the slave traders… so kinda your own fault there guys…I’m vehemently against oppression of any sort and firmly practice the thinking of we're all the same, money makes you no better or worse than I. I don’t go around all day and lament about my ancestors being forced to construct pyramids, nor do you see Jewish people slamming Germans for WWII (WAAAY more current and justifiable to a point), so what makes that socially accepted?

3,What is the worst thing about being a veteran?,Military Veterans,The Worst Thing,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Can I answer this question? Perhaps. Can I answer it better than the other authors who have already submitted answers? Probably not.As the question appears to imply survival after military service, I will, for the sake of argument, take the most obviously worst thing about being a veteran off the the table; i.e., death, or the threat of it.With what is left, I will likely echo much of what has already been written, but, perhaps, my answer might have some element that is different from some of the other answers. And as, exhibited by the answers already given, the answer sought is going to be different from one veteran to the next. On the one hand, I am close to Ross Griego and Charles Edward Martin in feeling gratitude for being a veteran, and having had the opportunity to serve my country; on the other hand, I think most veterans do not go into the service thinking they will come out of their service thinking that their service will somehow shorten their life, or reduce, if only in subtle, indirect ways, their quality of life. Yet, I think most, if not all, veterans experience some version of this. Look at most Vietnam veterans; because of likely exposure to Agent Orange, many of them have had significantly shorter lifespans than veterans of World War II, for example. Desert Storm and later veterans have, in many cases, been exposed to other risks that may be affecting their health, whether it be exposure to depleted uranium, oil field fires, burn pits, or other environmental hazards. Personally, I have various chronic conditions that will, at the least, follow me until the day I die, if not get worse as I get older.In that spirit, it may be, for some veterans, the worst thing can be the invisibility of their wounds to others, making it difficult to get others to understand those wounds. It may be, in a related way, the level of suffering they have to endure, either before finally getting some help, or because that help never comes, the suffering finally becomes too much to endure any longer.At the same time, for other veterans, like Dallas McKay, the service turned them into adrenaline junkies, in such intense ways, that virtually anything else in the civilian world is a weak, tame vessel compared to their combat experiences. I do not claim to have experienced combat, but I think I have had some parallel experiences that, while perhaps not as intense, provide a level of meaning, of being ALIVE, that are difficult for most people in civilian life to understand.While I personally try to presume any female non-staff employee at the VA, and not serving as an obvious caretaker for a veteran, is a veteran seeking and deserving of service, I realize there is a great deal of truth to what veterans like Christi Zelaya have experienced. I also know that, while the VA is working hard to improve care for women veterans, it has a long way to go before it shows the signs of quality most male veterans experience, and that the biggest obstacle that they may face is the attitudes of most people, including as many male veterans as civilians. Similar, but still different, problems exist for homeless veterans also.I also feel awkward when thanked for “my service,” much like Dallas McKay. As I have posted before, when this first happened to me, I felt a little like a cashier at a fast food place. Over the years, I have mellowed enough to be a bit more graceful, and willing to say “You’re welcome” in most instances.And some vets have a hard time adjusting to civilian life, especially if they do not come out of the service with apparent marketable job skills. I have been lucky in this throughout my career, entering into the service with my skills already in place, albeit with some additional experience still needed that has come with time.That all said, military service is a distinct honor and privilege, one that many people cannot perform, let alone choose to. Thus, there is an additional element of sacrifice in knowing that we may be defending people who would violently disagree with our point of view, burn the flag, or even get in our face with criticism of everything our military stands for.In the end, today’s military service has become its own elite, its own “1%,” if you will. Like I suspect most veterans feel, I have come to this status with mixed feelings — of pride, gratitude, yet with some pockets of pain and regret for all I have sacrificed, and may continue to sacrifice, for my country. So, being a veteran is not an unalloyed joy, but it is also not something so terrible that it would prevent me from doing it all over again.",197,3,82,730,0,0

Democrats are projected to win the national House popular vote by some 7 or 8 percentage points, which is pretty much in line with the long-run average.That 8–9-point swing is consistent, in an adjusted uniform national swing model, with Democrats gaining a net of 20 seats in the House, for a total of 214. It’s short of a majority, but no good forecast is ever a point estimate alone; instead it’s a probability distribution admitted by three major sources of uncertainty: uncertainty from polls, uncertainty from model assumptions, and uncertainty from the passage of time (essentially that circumstances can change given time, and we don’t know how they’ll change).I’ve simulated that probability distribution below and estimated a 58% probability that Republicans retain majority control:How to read this probability distribution:On the x-axis: number of seats won by Democrats.The y-axis: the probability that Democrats win the number of seats given on the x-axis. For example, the probability that the Democrats win exactly 200 seats is 1.68%, because the bar at 200 seats on the x-axis is of height 0.0168.Colors: red bars indicate probabilities of Republican-majority outcomes, blue bars indicate Democratic-majority outcomes.Essentially you should look at this graph, observe that it’s a little more red than blue (but not by that much), and conclude that Republicans are favored to keep the House, but not overwhelmingly so. The middle 50% of outcomes include anywhere between 204 Democratic seats and 227 Democratic seats, so there’s plenty of room for variation.Contrast this with the Senate forecast, which estimates a 95% probability that Republicans maintain control:Unlike the House forecast, the Senate forecast is sensitive to state-level polling, but even this hasn’t affected Democratic chances much.

1,What political party would you be most likely to join/support if the democratic and republican parties of America collapse?,U.S. Political Parties,Democratic Party vs. Republican Party,1!,1!,1!,1!,"People of ordinary means need to realize their interests are aligned with those of the 1%, but irreconcilably opposed. There really isn’t even a name for what I believe, but I would like for an approach to the economy and the government to arise that would be led by a “Progressive Socialist Gradualism”. The goals have to be like those of the Progressives (those left of liberals but far right of socialists) — advancing the well being of people and the individual and maintaining democratic institutions and traditions.We need a revolution in the sense of removing corporations and highly wealthy individuals from control of government all at once, but beyond that it would have to be very measured and gradual, with due respect to individual rights not just goals for the collective.The economy obviously is more complex and the technologies and organizational structures more intricate than ever before. So you can’t just seize the means of production, etc and take over. In order to keep the capitalists on board (that is, keep them from refusing to run things that only they and their technicians know how to run — we want to prevent an Ayn Rand-style strike by the capitalists), worker ownership would have to be phased in carefully and slowly. This involves huge dangers to the revolution, but I see no way around it. A lot of more tangible, obvious things could be turned into workers co-ops like stores. Other things would have to wait.A very, very long term goal should be collectivizing workplaces and ending coops many many decades later IF the workers want that. Short term, the workers of each workplace (sometimes the existing corporation might have to be left intact instead of breaking it down into separation locations; in which case the workers of the whole corporation would own the whole corporation). Right now, if 20 people work at a Penny General, shareholders own Penny General. I would say we should have a party that would start making the various local workplaces controlled and owned by the very people who work there, who would of course hire professional managers to help them run things.Local banks could become community credit union, and the Federal Reserve administered by socialist-minded governors who would be also professional, university educated economists could start putting money into the economy through them rather than through private banks.Insurance companies becoming fully socialist and cheaper for customers would be easy. Instead of 20 different car insurance companies competing for business, every one pays a few cents more per gallon and that takes care of car insurance with a single government entity.The point of workers co-ops, from which I digressed, is not to make the workers rich, and it probably would not because as workers get paid a lot more of the profits, the prices will in the (workers-run) markets will rise, since for a long time we will be under workers’ capitalism. The point is establishing worker power and control and educating them in how to govern and do business and giving them dignity and good conditions.When historical cycles get us back to the point of revisiting socialism, we MUST have a firm commitment and a practical plan that AVOIDS KILLING, etc while still neutralizing those who would sabotage the revolution. A strong balance between freedom of speech and eliminating speech that sabotages the revolution or spreads racism, etc. will have to be figured out. Capitalism has never hesitated to violent sabotage socialist revolutions, including those voted in by the people in free and fair elections. Capitalism, when it wanted land and resources, had no problem doing the “Enclosure” and dispossessing numberless farmers from land that had been theirs in common, at incalculable human cost. Capitalism had no problem with killing 100 million in the slave trade and destroying many times that number of lives outside of actual killing. Socialism under misguided and overzealous, impatient leadership has done great harm, and whatever party arises in America must do it right this time, but there is no way of not acting against the interest of some.Now, I have no issue whatever with having the press owned by workers’ organizations and giving that press a wide measure of freedom of speech — though never to advocate removing worker control or ownership or going back to capitalism. My point here is a country like America I think we would have to put two or three million in confinement when they advocate against workers interests or spout racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia, etc. But even then it can be done humanely, non-enslavingly.Religion will have to be given virtually complete freedom in the home and in the church house, the temple, the mosque; but it will have to be stopped from having vast media empires and from using its power to promote right wing agendas and lies or to lead. It should be able to address its moral concerns in a manner true to itself but do it in the manner of “we believe homosexuality is a sin because…” not in the manner of “These Sodomite f———- should be shot dead in the street”. (And while most churches don’t do that, I’ve encountered those that do).So, a party that is forward looking in its aspiration, socialist in its goals, with a bill of rights, and gradual in making changes.

He’s an entertainer who found his niche in reality TV, where he played a rich entrepreneur who’d mastered the art of the deal and could pick a winner and sniff out a loser. In the real world — not TV “reality” — he’s an old man who was a lifelong joke to New Yorkers (like me), known for being a playboy with vulgar taste, flamboyant lifestyle, a business model based on bullying, dubious connections, cheating habits, trophy wives and mistresses, inconstant politics, no principles and no sense of decorum whatever.

Since then…I sometimes wonder how a decent man like Obama got into the White House, which had become something like a bouncy castle inhabited by clowns.

But now Kim Jong-Un is backtracking, and a deal that seemed difficult at best now looks even less likely to come to pass.There’s a lot that can happen between now and the November election. It’s quite possible we’ll all have learned much more about the findings from Mueller’s Russia investigation before then. It’s possible that Trump could finally do what we all know he’s been itching to do, fire Mueller, precipitating a constitutional crisis. It’s possible Trump could be subpoenaed to testify before a Grand Jury by Mueller, and refuse, tying the matter up in the courts. Any of these scenarios would likely be very harmful to Republicans’ prospects in the November election.On the other hand, if the economy continues to show strength, and Trump is able to notch a foreign policy “win” or two, and nothing more damaging than what we’ve already heard about emerges from Mueller, then much of the Democrats’ advantage could crumble.The opposition party almost always gains ground in midterm elections, and there’s no reason to believe that won’t happen this time as well.

(i.e. normally a Democrat President elected to his first term means first midterms go to Republicans; a Republican President elected to his first term means the first midterms go to Democrats)This happens the vast majority of midterm elections for a newly elected President.

It was bad. Unemployment was bad. I have no idea how old you are, but I had five friends who lost their jobs, and all had been at their companies for more than 10 years. One had been with Motorola for 26 years. All were excellent workers, and I know that for a fact. Obama did manage to pull us out of that, and he actually did it faster than I thought would be possible. (I lived through smaller downturns in the economy that lasted 12 long years). By the time Obama left, the Stock Market recovered fully (and hit record highs) and unemployment was at a rate considered “better than good.” Every measure of the economy was positive, when he left office. In fact, nobody was even bothering to discuss the nation’s economy, in an election year, for the first time in my life. I go back to Eisenhower. Nobody can dispute those things.Two wars. Gulp. When Obama took office, we were knee deep in the midst of two wars, and even worse, they were both obviously unnecessary wars. That was like two Vietnams, at the same time. We were not fighting because we had been attacked by foreign governments. We were fighting because 1) this is a nation where a bunch of new terrorists who attacked us trained. 2) We think they have “weapons of mass destruction.” (They did not, and we were misled.) Really. Both wars were very tricky, ugly, and the kind of war that it is tough to get out of, especially politically… And, the mid East is a nightmare, period. There are often no clear friends, and no clear enemies, anywhere in the Mid East.

3,Was it the intention of the 2nd Amendment of the U.S. Constitution that any weapon the government has be permitted for civilian use?,Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Thanks for the A2A. The question was: Was it the intention of the 2nd Amendment of the U.S. Constitution that any weapon the government has be permitted for civilian use?This is such a loaded question, isn’t it? If I answer yes, the immediate response will be that I want every man, woman, and child to walk the streets with a submachinegun, and nuclear warhead missiles in every back yard. If I answer no, the response will be that I think the Second Amendment only applies to smoothbore muskets and spike bayonets, and possibly infantry swords.I think that the intention of the Second Amendment was to enable the people of the United States to be able to raise a militia, independent of any government agency or oversight. That’s sort of built into the first half of the amendment. You’ll notice I said “enable the people”, not “require the people” to raise a militia. The militia is raised in the same way that a bucket brigade is raised for a fire — at need, on the spot, and for a well-defined and self limiting purpose. That purpose may be to oppose an incursion by an unfriendly power, which would have been hostile Indians or a foreign nation in the 18th century, and might be a drug cartel today.But the Second Amendment never said that the people had to be part of an organized militia to keep and bear arms. The right to keep and bear arms ALLOWS the people to be able to raise a militia at need, and that’s why it’s important.That militia needs to have the weapons necessary to undertake the task for which it was raised. For some things, rifles are sufficient. For others, more powerful weapons might be called for. But even if I said that ownership of nuclear submarines, stealth bombers, hydrogen bombs, and long range artillery should be permitted to individuals, these things are self regulating due to the ruinous cost of acquiring, manning, maintaining, and deploying them. Those aren’t militia weapons. Fully automatic rifles and machineguns ARE militia weapons, although I’m willing to see some controls on those — which we already have. (Although I oppose the 1984 manufacture cut-off date, and the 1934 act that regulated fully automatic weapons was passed for purely political reasons.)So, should individuals be able to own ANY weapon of war? That’s a debatable question, but let me ask you this: Suppose I find a few billion dollars in loose change in my couch and buy an aircraft carrier and air wing. Cool! How am I going to maintain it? Where am I going to put it? It’s a little too big to put on a trailer in my driveway, and the US Navy isn’t going to tolerate it cruising in US waters — too much of a threat! Where am I going to find a few thousand kindred spirits to man it, and how am I going to train them? It’s a full time job, so how do I pay them? Oh, and how do I buy ordinance, since there are exclusive contract agreements between ordinance manufacturers and the US government? (That’s just how business works.) The bottom line here is to stop being ridiculous.The Second Amendment confirms your right to keep and bear arms. It doesn’t force you to keep and bear arms, nor does it say that you are guaranteed to be able to afford them.",305,5,60,524,0,0
3,Was it the intention of the 2nd Amendment of the U.S. Constitution that any weapon the government has be permitted for civilian use?,Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"The simple answer is….Okay, there isn’t a simple answer. If the question means personal weapons, the answer is “Yes”, because the term “bear arms” referred to the common weapons of the ordinary soldier, so if an ordinary soldier carries one, the Second means a citizen can as well — after all, the only reason that a solder can carry any given weapon is because the citizens have assigned a portion of their right to the soldier, so if the citizen has no right to a particular weapon, then neither does the soldier.But there are weapons individuals don’t get to have — yet that doesn’t mean citizens can’t have them, because the term “bear arms” also applies to groups (teams, crews, etc.) of weapons because there are weapons utilized by groups of soldiers, and again the soldiers can only have the authority to use such weapons because the citizens have that right and assign its exercise in part to the soldiers.Then there are weapons the Founding Fathers would have considered just plain immoral, such that no one should have them. Today we call those “weapons of mass destruction” — and in a reasonably rational world no one would have such weapons, as their very existence is offensive. Unfortunately, we don’t live in anything approaching a reasonably rational world, and sometimes the only way to keep irrational folks from using weapons of mass destruction is to be able to hit back with the same or worse.Speaking of reasonably rational, the concepts in the Second Amendment contain within them the idea of appropriateness: the weapons citizens are expected to have are those appropriate to a likely purpose. Since in the colonial era the constabulary would commonly call on armed citizens for assistance, then rationally citizens everywhere ought to have weapons suitable for assisting the police if asked. A situation quite similar to the colonial era is the matter of business, its property and equipment, which can need to be defended. The FFs would find it strange indeed to see merchant ships sailing in the Persian Gulf area without weapons sufficient to drive off or eliminate any pirates that might assail them, or ranchers on the border not armed sufficiently to tidily put an end to criminal trespass on their lands — indeed they would find it offensive that citizens on the borders aren’y allowed to organize, acquire sufficient weaponry, and train with it, to eliminate any danger from drug cartels (although they would find laws against recreational drugs more than a bit perplexing).Of course the ultimate application of the Second Amendment is to make happen what Jefferson suggested ought to occur every generation or so: a revolution to trim back government and maintain liberty. So in times when it begins to look to many citizens as though the government needs that trimming, whatever citizens determine they might need to achieve that becomes appropriate.",64,3,56,"1,055",0,0

Why on Earth would anyone attempt to shoehorn our massively larger and more complex nuclear-armed world into the concepts worked with by the good people at the start of the United States of America?Do you honestly believe that Washington, Jefferson, John Adams, etc., would have wanted every household to have its own nuclear weapons, in case their neighbors got too loud on Saturday night?

This was because the “natural militia” was considered the first level of defense; the natural militia being all able bodied men of age 17 and over who were expected to arm and defend themselves, their family, property, and neighbors against attack. Very few citizens of the time could actually afford to own and maintain a mortar or a cannon, but if they wanted one no national law prohibited it, neither did it require any citizen to own one. Many frontier privately owned outposts did have artillery, as did private ships, for the purpose of self-defense.By proper interpretation, it was the intent of the first amendment for a person to own the necessary armament to insure their own safety. It was also expected, and quickly defined by (usually) local laws, that firearms were to be used in a responsible and safe manner. So if a person were indiscriminately firing in a populated area they would be arrested and fined or imprisoned. That same founding attitude would most like apply today such that a person could own and bear a fully automatic weapon, but would have to use it properly and safely.Dynamite, bombs, and other explosives have been subject to state and local laws for centuries in the US, and now also are federally regulated. So this would also preclude owning grenades, rocket launchers, and armed nuclear submarines or ICBM’s.

The response was a yes.Now, I haven't seen or read these records, but it is my opinion, as a protector of the Constitution and a former soldier, that it indeed does apply to all arms technology, not just muskets, like some people want to claim.You see, at the time of the Revolution, and the Civil War,too, the military did not have enough guns to supply everyone. So, many soldiers provided their own. Muskets were the technology at the time, and both civilians and military alike had them. It was written about muskets and cannons, but it is meant for the current level of technology.Another way to look at is very simple. The vagueness of the ammendment is the answer for any question regarding weapons, whether it's about possession (to keep), open or concealed carry (to bear), technology, or specific weapons.

The intention of the second amendment was to allow states to raise their own militia, and not have all military under centralised federal control.Federalism was a big issue at the time, and states were afraid they would lose all their power to the federal government. The second amendment ensured that individual states could raise their own militia, and thereby ensure that people from that state would be represented in the armed forces. It was really a states’ rights issue.Of course that could still mean that the second amendment allows military weapons. But it’s up to the individual states, not individual citizens.Obviously it’s been thoroughly reinterpreted since then. The modern interpretation of the second amendment has little to do with its original intention.Edit: A couple of commenters take issue with the focus on the original intention, and claim that the modern interpretation can be the only correct one. I’d like to point out that the question asks about intention and is in the past tense, so I’m taking this to mean that it’s about the original intention. That means looking at James Madison and his contemporaries, and not at how we would interpret this today.

2,What's the best and worst thing about America?,Being an Adult,The Best Thing,The Worst Thing,1!,1!,1!,"The best thing about the United States of America is the Bill of Rights limiting the power of government. Many nations have what claims to be a Bill of Rights - but when one looks at the actual texts, they do not really limit the size and scope of government as the terms of the American Bill of Rights would do.The worst thing about the United States of America is that much of the Bill of Rights IS NOT ENFORCED. For example, the 10th Amendment has been rendered almost a nullity by Supreme Court decisions. The “general welfare” (from “the common defence and general welfare” in the preamble to Article One, Section Eight of the Constitution of the United States) has been declared by the Supreme Court a catch-all general welfare spending power - meaning that the government can tax and spend for any scheme or benefit that it considers for the “general welfare”. This makes a nonsense of the rest of Article One, Section Eight, where the specific spending powers of the Congress are listed, and of the Tenth Amendment of the Bill of Rights seeking to limit the spending powers of the Federal Government. The Supreme Court (during World War II) also declared that the Federal Government could control the production and sale of goods and services that were NOT sold over State lines - this “interpretation” of the words Article One, Section Eight that the Congress may “regulate interstate commerce” again makes a nonsense of the Tenth Amendment.Both the 4th and the 5th Amendments of the Bill of Rights have been undermined by Supreme Court decisions allowing government (Federal, State and local - remember the 14th Amendment makes clear that the Bill of Rights applies to the States, not just the Federal Government) to freeze or confiscate money or property without proof (beyond reasonable doubt) that the money or property is the profits of crime, (thus turning the principles of the Common Law on their head) and have allowed the existence of “crimes” without proof of individual guilt (RICO and so on). Various justifications have been made for all this (such as the “War On Drugs” and the “War on Racism” and the“War On Organised Crime” and the “War On White Collar Fraud” and on and on), but the fact remains that all this is an assault on the 4th and 5th Amendments of the Bill of Rights.The First Amendment (Freedom of Speech and of Religion) and the Second Amendment (the Right to Keep and Bear Arms) are also under threat - with Freedom of Speech under threat by the idea that it does not apply to “Hate Speech” (i.e. speech the left does not agree with), and Freedom of Religion is under threat by the “anti discrimination” doctrine of “Civil Rights” (which turns the old view of Civil Rights, that they were LIMITATIONS on government power, on its head - with Civil Rights now being used as a excuse for government power). The Right to Keep and Bear Arms is also under threat - with the legend being pushed that it was about hunting, when it was actually about people having the right (and moral duty) to oppose government tyranny by force of arms.All the above being said - the American Bill of Rights (in spite of all the attacks upon it - in spite of the various ways it has been undermined and is now threatened) still exists - and no other country has anything quite like it (many countries have texts that look like the American Bill of Rights at first glance - but when looks closely they are not really based on the same principles). Even in its undermined and threatened condition - the American Bill of Rights is still the best thing in the United States of America and the best thing in the entire world.The United States of America is not really lines on a map or a particular racial or ethnic group - the United States of America is the Bill of Rights (as British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said - the United States is an IDEA, the idea of LIMITED government), the fate of the Bill of Rights will determine whether the United States of America stands of falls.",324,0,97,"1,368",0,0

But many Americans have a hard time looking beyond the “Me, myself, and I” to the “we”. Even the type of question that runs ‘why should children be able to _______ in society’ is indicative of this. “It takes a village to raise a child” is an axiom that is true.

They accomplished this by creating fake social media accounts (with a large staff of Russians creating content and a software army to make it seem like their voice was much bigger). They even organized actual campaign events.Then the Russians illegally purchased ads on Facebook. US law prevents foreigners to spend money in the US to influence a US election, but the Russians dropped $100,000 on ads.Of all the Russians did, probably the most effective at influencing the election was poisoning the relationship between Clinton and Sanders supporters by way of hacking Democratic National Committee (DNC) emails and passing them on to WikiLeaks, who leaked them on the eve of the Democratic National Convention. The DNC emails showed that the national committee had favored Clinton over Sanders, a clear violation of policy. Some outraged Sanders supporters could not bring themselves to vote for Clinton and just stayed home or voted for a third party.Speaking of FacebookCambridge Analytica claimed that they had the technology to influence people’s opinions. A wealthy Republican donor paid the company, one whose directors was Trump Campaign chief Steve Bannon, $50 million to do just that; however, Cambridge Analytica lacked the data to feed into their mind-twisting process, so they fraudulently obtained detailed personal information on 50 million Facebook users, and used that data to create manipulate opinion. Facebook’s market capitalization dropped by billions of dollars after the disclosure.Then there was ComeyHow many times have you heard someone from the government say “we cannot comment on an ongoing investigation”? So exactly why did the whole country find out that the FBI had reopened the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email server? It came from FBI director James Comey in a letter to Congress just 11 days before the election. It is certainly ironic that Trump fired the one man who perhaps was responsible for winning the election for him.And the Tweeter in ChiefDonald Trump lied a great deal during the 2016 election campaign. That’s why I added “misconduct” to the title of this story. It’s not illegal for a candidate to lie during an election campaign. Even Clinton occasionally got things wrong.

Here’s another list.Pointing the FingerI’m not going to say that one of the things in this article caused Trump to win a tight election. I can’t prove that all of them together swayed the decision. What I will say is that the Republican campaign benefitted from illegality and misconduct in a way that the Democrats did not. From what is publicly known, the forces of crime and deceit were on the Republican side.

Probably not. I’d reserve that spot for the “reopening” of the email investigation for what turned out to be nothing. (Although in Wisconsin, I’d give the top spot to voter-suppression efforts that wiped 200,000 votes off the books.)But I do think Russia was successful in exacerbating the rift between Hillary and the progressive/Bernie left, and if that played a role in 70,000 people staying home or voting third-party… there’s your horse race.Follow along with the logic:Russia was behind the DNC/Podesta email hacks. The waters have since been muddied between “who did the hacks?” and “did Team Trump collude/have knowledge of them?”, but the initial conclusion that Guccifer 2.0 = Russia was pretty definite and bipartisan.The DNC emails in particular were designed to be released at a time to cause maximum disruption to Hillary’s campaign, right on the eve of the convention.(OK, Hillary’s decision to hire Debbie Wasserman Schultz to her campaign less than a day after she was removed from the DNC was face-palmingly stupid and didn’t help matters. Point granted.)The interpretation of those emails was a place where Russian propaganda probably played a tremendous role. For every person calmly pointing out “look, most of the emails in question represent frustrated staffers blowing off steam at a time where Bernie was mathematically eliminated and was staying in the race anyway, and there’s no evidence that venting translated to action” there were probably 10 Russian bots screaming about how THE DNC HATED BERNIE, HERE’S THE SMOKING GUN.So is it possible that got 70,000 people to either stay home or vote third-party (Jill Stein, Gary Johnson, write-in Bernie Sanders, etc.)?

I wouldn’t agree that it’s the best reason to vote for someone, but I understand the feeling.After four years of Obama, I was kind of disappointed in his presidency. It’s been so long since that time that I can’t remember why exactly (I have a horrible memory), but I remember just this vast gap between what I expected out of him and what we all got. There were a lot of factors he had working against him, to be sure, but I always felt that he could have put a lot more effort into advocating for legislation at the least, and I think he missed a lot of opportunities in his first four years.Watching him on the campaign trail in 2012 was exhausting, because he was exhausted. It was flat out not inspirational. Mitt Romney was nothing special either, but he was a decent man, fired up to take over from an administration that he thought was pushing the country in the wrong direction. He had a hunger to win, and he was a decent man. I was almost convinced to vote for him. I really could have been persuaded either way, because I thought both of them were very capable of running the country safely.So, what pushed me to vote Democratic was something quite like the feeling you seem to be referencing here. It seemed like everyone on the Republican side couldn’t fathom us wanting to give Obama a second term. They seemed so sure that Obama had done a trash job and that we would ditch him in a heartbeat when 2012 rolled around. They insulted him so much that it felt like an affront to my decision making capabilities. It was as if they had taken away my choice before I had the chance to make it. And, to be completely honest, it seemed like 40% racism on their part.So, in the end, given a choice where I honestly didn’t prefer one candidate over the other, I decided to thumb my nose at everyone Republican who promised to make Obama a one-term president. Fuck y’all.Having said that, I’ve been preparing for two terms of Trump since the 2016 disaster. Why? Because the first thing my friends would say to me is “It’s only four years.” No. It’s fucking not only four years, especially if your dumb ass acts that way. You can’t cry your way out of acknowledging a full half of your country, stonewall a president as much as possible because you think he’s the Antichrist, insult his base, threaten to impeach him at every turn, and then come out 4 years later under the Bernie banner and pretend you’re going to have an easy win because “of course nobody wants Pussy Hound 2: Electric Boogaloo”. Like, we literally just proved that’s not how it works. Granted, the nicknames were different, but GAH! GET THE POINT! HISTORY! REPETITION! CYCLES!So, yeah. If you want to vote for Donald Trump for that reason, I get it. I really do. Especially if Democrats decide to roll up another Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders as your alternative. I get the hatred for them, for sure.But, please; if we get our shit together and pull a candidate whose decency you can see, who treats others with respect, who wants to reach out to you and yours and help lift up your way of life, please consider voting for them. Don’t vote out of spite if you can vote for the best person, trust me. Vote for spite if both candidates are shite, but I want you to know that Donald Trump is not a Mitt Romney or John McCain to me; he really scares me something fierce.

One of which is claimed to be liberal biased, another which is claimed to be conservative biased. In fact, the media is viewership driven, and is apolitical for the most part. Say, if Fox news found it more profitable to be more left-leaning, they would of course provide more liberal material than they currently do. Note the difference between Fox the television channel, which supports shows that are arguably left-leaning (i.e. The Simpsons, American Dad, Married…With Children &c.) and Fox news, which is largely of a conservative bent.Obviously, Fox does not make an underdog out of President Trump. In fact, a liberally-biased channel would be served politically by showing President Trump as a weaker, not a stronger candidate. This polarizes the viewers and drives up viewership. Neil Cavuto, a conservative reporter on Fox, recently dressed the president down and called him out on, what Cavuto sees, as baldfaced lies and absurdities. This may be a good move for Fox, although I don’t doubt the sincerity of Mr. Cavuto. This instantly drew a line in the sand for hardcore supporters of the president and Cavuto, possibly drawing viewership from the purportedly liberal channels.If the media is falsely making the president out to be the underdog. it would be to drive ratings rather than for political reasons.

0,Why are you democratic?,Democratic Party (US politics),Democracy,Politics,1!,1!,1!,"To some degree, my politics are inherited. My dad’s a Democrat. My mom’s a Democrat. My grandparents were all Democrats (though my mother’s dad voted for Nixon in 1972, which scandalized everyone). I have the obituaries of some of my great-great-grandparents, and all but one of those that listed politics, indicated they were Democrats. This was back in the late 1800s, when the parties were pretty different. My ancestors were northern Democrats, which were not the big slavery supporters. As I understand it, back then the big issue was the silver standard. Farmers, such as my ancestors, favored it because it made borrowing cheaper for them. The one exception to this was my father’s father’s mother’s dad, who was a Civil War veteran and a freethinker. There was not a Republican in the bunch that I know about.I was raised as a Democrat. I remember hearing about what a scumbag Nixon was in the car on the way to school in first grade. My dad used to be a fairly big deal in the local Democratic Party. In 2008 and 2012, he canvassed for Obama and got to meet him. At family gatherings, we can talk politics without much fear of argument.Having said that, it doesn’t mean I’ve never considered other points of view. I remember back in the Reagan era when I was in college and just about everyone I knew at my school was Republican, there were definitely things about the GOP I liked more than the Democrats. All of my college roommates were Republicans. When I was an expat in Taiwan in the early 1990s, I lived with a moderate Republican and a fairly lefty Democrat and I often agreed with the moderate Republican more on issues.But when I came back to the U.S., the first thing that really made me turn against the Republicans was the way they treated Bill Clinton. It seemed pretty clear that, after 12 years of Republican presidents, they imagined the presidency was theirs by divine right. They slandered the living Hell out of Clinton beyond anything I’d ever seen in politics before (still do), launched investigations against him that even they knew would turn up nothing, and tried to impeach him basically for a sexual affair that was less scandalous than those that many of their leaders were carrying on at the same time.That moved me back into the Democratic camp, but that didn’t prevent me from considering voting for moderate Republican candidates. The thing is that, as time has gone on, moderate Republicans have almost completely ceased to exist.Meanwhile, the behavior of Republicans and Republican politicians has gotten worse and worse. There was the 2000 elections where Republicans had zero interest in finding a fair way of determining who actually won the election and only cared about making sure their guy did. Then their candidate gave away the budget surplus to rich people, built up another budget deficit by invading Iraq under false premises, sanctioned torture by our government, got us into two military quagmires etc. etc. . Bush was an amazingly bad president, but still they voted for him again in 2004.When Obama won the presidency in 2008, they openly declared that they would block everything he tried to do, thereby making it very hard for him to solve any of the country’s problems that he was elected to address. When he used a few executive orders to get around Republican opposition, they called him a dictator.Then in 2016, Republicans elected the least qualified, least suited president for the job in the history of the country and it’s just gone downhill ever since. Ultimately, I guess a lot of the reason I’m a Democrat is that, flawed as they may be, they haven’t become as thoroughly corrupt and as contemptuous of facts, logic, common sense and decency as the Republicans.",123,1,68,726,0,0
0,Why are you democratic?,Democratic Party (US politics),Democracy,Politics,1!,1!,1!,"I live in Georgia's Sixth Congressional District. The Washington Post described this area as “the Great White North, a Republican pollster’s dream, a sprawl of affluent suburbs as far as the eye can see, a Lexus in every driveway and a Lean Cuisine in every microwave.” This is Newt Gingrich and Tom Price country. I guess you could call it the birth place of the 1994 Republican Revolution.It's tough being a Democrat here. I've had yard signs stolen and bumper stickers scraped off my vehicles. I've been given the one finger salute more times than I can count for daring to have those stickers that showed my support for Clinton, for Gore, for Kerry, for Obama, and for Clinton again. I'm not the most popular guy in my neighborhood. Some have asked me why I subject myself to it all.""Why are you a Democrat,"" they inquire.The answer is simple. Principles.But believe it or not, once upon a time I thought I was a Republican. I grew up in a lower middle class home where my parents were more concerned with feeding and clothing three growing boys than they were with politics. I was an exception to the ""you are what you're born as"" rule. My parents weren't big church goers so I didn't carry a religious preference into adulthood. My parents weren't overtly political so, again, I didn't carry a party preference into adulthood. However, as a somewhat impressionable high school boy in the 80s, I was taken in by Ronald Reagan's charisma and machismo. To me, he was what a leader should be - a tough talker and very personable. I didn't understand the Republican party's policies until I was in college and, after agirlfriend dragged me to a College Republicans meeting, I realized I had very little in common with them. When she dumped me like a stone in a pond some months later, she accusingly called me a ""Democrat!"" GASP!Moi? A Democrat? I'd watched those campaign commercials where GHW Bush called Michael Dukakis a ""liberal."" I wasn't one of them. Was I?Well, on paper, in regards to the issues, I was.And as I went through college, I realized I arrived at my political state through an evolutionary process. Coming from a working class family and racially diverse school system, I developed a firm belief that the government's role is to protect its citizens not just from foreign threats but from domestic threats and economic hardships as well. I also cultivated a passion for the First Amendment, guaranteeing intellectual and religious freedom.All hallmarks of the Democratic Party.The Democratic Party promised higher wages, shorter work weeks, overtime pay, and unemployment benefits for American workers. All opposed by the Republicans, I might add.The Democratic Party promised a revolutionary economic package that lifted the country out of the Great Depression. Opposed by the Republicans, I might add.The Democratic Party promised equal rights to all, regardless of race and gender. Opposed by the Republicans TO THIS DAY, I might add.The Democratic party promised to defeat fascism and totalitarianism in World War II. Opposed by the Republicans, I might add. And now, the Republican party seems to fully embrace fascism. Hmm.The Democratic party WILL offer state funded health care to our country. It is immoral that in the richest country in the world, people have to put jelly jars and coffee cans on the counters of 7-11 stores begging for pocket change so their baby can get a life saving operation.Why am I ‘democratic?’ To answer this, I’ll use quotes from President John F. Kennedy and Senator Mark Warner.If by a ""Liberal"" they mean someone who looks ahead and not behind, someone who welcomes new ideas without rigid reactions, someone who cares about the welfare of the people-their health, their housing, their schools, their jobs, their civil rights and their civil liberties-someone who believes we can break through the stalemate and suspicions that grip us in our policies abroad, if that is what they mean by a ""Liberal"", then I'm proud to say I'm a ""Liberal.”I am a Democrat because the greatest and most noble political experiments of our time had their birth in our party.I am a Democrat because the New Deal literally saved the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans.I am a Democrat because a generation after a Democratic president started the Peace Corps, you can still find faded photographs of John F. Kennedy on the walls of homes from South Africa to South America.I am a Democrat because fighting for working men and women is always the right fight.I am a Democrat because many in our party led the struggle for civil rights - in the tough places like Virginia and Mississippi - and because we recognize that discrimination and bigotry are not dead - and that we must continue to seek equal opportunity for all.I am a Democrat because despite our failures, our missteps, and our excesses - we know that waging a war on poverty does not mean fighting the individuals who are poor.I am a Democrat because we know that today's battle is about the future versus the past - and it's time to put aside yesterday's battles of us versus them.In fact, I think the Democratic Party is the party of the American Dream.

I’m a Democrat for a lot of the reasons others have described.I was “raised” a Democrat. My mother was actively involved in politics and my first political action was helping her campaign for John Kennedy when I was 13 years old. I lived in Florida then, and everyone I knew was a Democrat. Mom was friends with the Mayor of our city, our members of Congress, and our State legislators. She was a precinct committee person for about 20 years. You might say I cut my teeth on democratic principles.In 1980, I was married, living in a small farming town and a military base, the mother of 3 children, and was surrounded by republicans. I soon fell under the spell of Ronald Reagan, and changed parties. (I never told my mom.) My world was very small and everyone around me was like-minded. It was easier to be a republican than to struggle against the tide.In 2000, I cast my last republican vote for a reason I’m not very proud of: Al Gore was boring; G.W.B. seemed more charismatic. I was soon disillusioned - by his getting us into a war (“Mission Accomplished”), by his response to Hurricane Katrina (I had been through Hurricane Andrew and knew how important help from D.C. was), and by his strutting and preening. I switched parties, put my activist hat on, campaigned for Kerry in ‘04, Obama in ’08 and ‘12, and Sanders (and then Clinton) in ‘16. I’ve never looked back, and have never been tempted to vote republican again.As I watch republicans in Congress try to turn the clock back to the lily-white ’50s (I was there; it wasn’t that great), watch the current occupant of the Oval Office continually demean the office he holds, watch his appointees rape our public lands, separate families, excoriate people of color and other nationalities, lie repeatedly, praise white supremacists and belittle the First Amendment, get richer from his office (along with innumerable other arrogant and bigoted behaviors), all while republicans remain silent, I can’t imagine that any of these actions uphold the principles of democracy, nor can I imagine ever again in my life voting for a republican.The Democratic Party could be more progressive, IMO, but for now, they’re better than the other options.

Israel is our major ally in the middle east. Many foreign governments, for purely political reasons having to do with not annoying the Muslims in the region, have maintained embassies in Tel Aviv, as has the United States, even though Israel has ALWAYS considered Jerusalem to be their capital city.Israel would appreciate other governments recognize their right to choose their own capital city and it is customary for those foreign governments to establish their embassies in that capital.George W. Bush and Barrack Obama both indicated that the United States would move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, but for 16 years did nothing to actually accomplish this move, knowing it would be controversial and that Israel’s neighbor’s would disapprove.So the ONLY thing that Trump has done as POTUS is what two previous presidents promised to do but did not have the balls to go through with.

3,What ever happened to civility toward police officers? Why is racism always to blame?,The Washington Post,Racism in the United States of America,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Oh racism is not always to blame but sometimes it is a factor in incidents. I did the job and can admit it happens. Why do so many people go to the knee jerk defensive position and deny, deny deny? It reminds me of a kid sticking his fingers in his ears and saying, “La, la, la, la, I'm not listening!” By the way, I didn't look at the linked video and won't be commenting on any specific incident on it.With the era of handy video a lot more people realize that there are police officers who are professionals and who give and receive basic civility, and there are the others. The others were around when I was in law enforcement decades ago, but the public was far less aware of them unless they had the misfortune to encounter Deputy Rude or Officer Aggressive or Constable Clueless. Their coworkers knew about them, and often had to smooth things over that these clods made into an unnecessary mess. I hated responding as back up for those types because I would be looked to for the solution after they had created a problem worse than existed before they arrived. Those were the times that I had to physically fight to get someone into custody or chase them on foot or calm a victim who was hysterical because of an officer.I worked with several officers who in my opinion never should have worn a badge or should have been weeded out during training or invited to find a new career after a very short time of being on their own on patrol. They are the tiny percentage who create problems for everyone else. One of the problem people that I dealt with while I was in Communications was arrogant and quite rude to coworkers, so I suspected that he was equally unpleasant to the public if not worse. He had a poor attention for details, did not listen to the dispatchers and blamed his errors on others. There are people like him in many jobs, but they don't hold the power of life and death in their hands.When someone like that guy does have a badge and a gun, it is a genuine problem. Add any racial bias on top of his other problems and it can exacerbate an already unfortunate situation right into the tragedy zone. It isn't always about race, but if you think that some problems are not made worse because of racial bias you are only fooling yourself.Police officers come from the general population of their society, and I'm unaware of any place on this planet that has learned to live in harmony with all and have no biases against any. The first step in not making decisions based on one's biases is acknowledging that one has them. I went through bias training at my police department in the 1980s. I believe it should be mandatory for law enforcement.They don't try to make you love everyone, but they do teach you how to recognize if you might have preconceived ideas about certain groups that could influence your decisions and cause you to treat people differently based on your assumptions. We learned to make decisions based on the person's actions not merely how they look or what we might think “those people"" are likely to do. What has this person said or done?Dealing with a diverse population at a major university with well over 20,000 students just on the main campus plus staff, faculty and visitors from many cultures, one had better get oneself sorted or there will be a bad incident eventually. The university has alumni clubs in more than 30 countries around the world. Therefore, having an unacknowledged bias against “foreigners” or Asians or Muslims or whatever was not added value for any of our officers, faculty or staff.In my opinion, there are some real problems in police hiring and training and some unprofessional conduct that we have seen played out in incidents that were avoidable in the US in recent years. I think that acknowledging it as an issue and examining it would be more beneficial to law enforcement and the public instead of everyone getting defensive immediately. The style of policing has changed in many areas from a community policing to something more aggressive that I'm not sure what the appropriate word for it would be. I have encountered it as a law abiding citizen who is a judge who just happens to be a woman of color.Was the officer aggressive and rude because that's his usual and quite unfortunate demeanor? Was it my color, gender, apparent age before I stopped coloring my gray hair? I will never know, and quite frankly it doesnt matter because it was unnecessary in each case and left a bad impression for no good reason. Those officers were not scaring me straight or teaching me a lesson or doing anything except making me debate in my head if I wanted to take more of my valuable time to write up a formal complaint detailing everything done incorrectly or even unsafely.It is that type of useless behavior that can antagonize the public. I'm not saying that members of the public cannot be total donkeys because they can take it a level that is mighty bad. Add alcohol and some people act like they were raised by wolves. I was cursed, spit at, bitten, kicked and all manner of other unpleasantness while I was in uniform, so I don't excuse the public at all. Some people are looking for a confrontation, a fight or whatever. The difference is that they have not been given the special powers that a society entrusts to their police. I expect the professionals to behave professionally and the criminals to behave however they choose. I don't entrust the good order of my society to the criminals.",537,33,1.4k,"4,004",0,0
3,What ever happened to civility toward police officers? Why is racism always to blame?,The Washington Post,Racism in the United States of America,1!,1!,1!,1!,"I think economic inequality plays a big - and frequently overlooked - role in worsening relations between the police and the public. As the US continues to devolve into an oligarchy, more people are discovering what Lisa Simpson knew in the 90s: the police are essentially elites’ private security forces.Just consider that whenever there’s a movement that challenges the corporate state - be it Occupy Wall Street or #NoDapl - cops are always there to crack skulls and help maintain the status quo.None of this should be surprising. After all, people tend to forget that professional policing is actually a fairly new phenomenon, and that policing was designed by and for elites. Indeed, certain progressive scholars argue that the police were created during the Industrial Revolution to keep the working classes in line.The Police Were Created to Control Working Class and Poor People, Not ‘Serve and Protect’David Graeber similarly argues that, contrary to popular perception, the police do not spend most of their time fighting “crime.” Instead, their main job is to use violence or the threat of violence to force compliance with administrative rules.Ferguson and the Criminalization of American LifeCome to think of it, I do find it strange that not having an up-to-date registration sticker is grounds for an encounter with an armed cop.Now, before the resident Quora cops or other police supporters brand me some nutty cop hater, I acknowledge that cops are necessary. We need cops to stop violent criminals, impaired drivers, and other dangerous people. Also, none of what I say is meant to attack the integrity of most individual police officers. I understand that the average cop isn’t some horrible brute.All in all, I don’t deny that cops do good things. However, doing those good things is not the primary function of the police. It’s important to keep in mind that when the chips are down, cops don’t protect and serve you; they serve the oligarchs.Since racism was mentioned, one also can’t forget how slave patrols shaped the development of American policing.Policing and Oppression Have Long Gone TogetherAgain, I’m not embracing radical positions such as the abolition of the police or saying that the majority of cops are pigs. I’m just saying that we need to be cognizant of the police’s true role in society. As growing numbers of people recognize the real nature of policing, I suspect that fewer will be inclined to think highly of cops.Unfortunately, since the US’s inequality keeps getting worse, I don’t think that police-public relations will improve anytime soon. Perhaps one day, the US will be a more egalitarian society and community policing will be the norm; but until then, cops will remain a necessary evil - and there will be more confrontational YouTube videos to come.Edit: Having watched the video - I tend to answer questions before checking out links, since I believe that questions should be addressed based on their merits - it’s a nothingburger as far as police vs. citizen confrontation videos go. That woman was clearly nuts, and the most courteous and professional officer in the world would have had a hard time getting respect. That said, my response still stands.",142,3,7,65,0,3

I voted for Jill Stein, I voted for Cynthia McKinney, I voted for Ralph Nader. It was all meaningless, the democrats don’t care. But Trump, Trump could bring them to their knees.It was a flight of fancy but I couldn’t do it; I couldn’t vote for Trump. Revolutions mostly don’t go the way anyone intended. Trump, to my thinking is too dangerous. He’s like a 14 year old Mussolini who is mostly obsessed with the goomara. I’m pretty sure there is a serious personality disorder lurking in Trump and he should never have been entrusted with the nuclear button.Trump is president and thanks to him, any naive notion of the left that the US is a democracy or is in anyway exceptional has been dispelled or more like shredded. That is actually good because I do believe that the US could be a great country but we have to be realistic about what we are and where we’ve come. So thanks President Trump, you were the one ironically to pull Lady Liberty’s dress up exposing her dirty little secrets. No democracy under here! What we got to see is a plutocracy run by greedy little men who think only of themselves.Now everyday we watch the shitshow. It’s like driving by the scene of a horrific accident and not being able to look away. The stress of each day waking up and finding some new outrage has to be resisted less Trump wins and we all go down the path of a fascist little twerp of a dictator.What do I like about Trump?

1,What are the rights of states within the United States and what is the differences in understanding of them between Democrat and Republican platforms?,Democratic Party vs. Republican Party,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"What are the rights of states within the United States and what is the differences in understanding of them between Democrat and Republican platforms?The US Constitution defines and delimits the powers of the Federal government, specifying that the powers not delineated are reserved by the states.The first ten amendments of the US Constitution listed specific protections for the people. These 10 amendments are collectively called the “Bill of Rights.” There were a lot of questions in the early days of the republic regarding whether the state governments were constrained by the protections afforded by the Bill of Rights.The 14th Amendment, which freed the slaves, also settled the question of the rights of states versus private citizens, declaring that“No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”According to this doctrine of equal protection, state governments were also constrained by the Bill of Rights, and by extension, states were constrained by all constitutional federal regulations.Applying the Bill of Rights to state governmentsDemocrats are generally in favor of a strong federal government, and usually have the opinion that all federal regulations should also apply to the states. Republicans generally prefer to limit the power of the federal government, thereby reserving more power for the states to exercise. Neither party is particulary consistent about this division, and depending on the specific issue, might find themselves paradoxically on the “wrong side” of the party lines.Marijuana legalization and drug prohibition are one broad category of legal contention where the parties find themselves at odds with their general philosophies. Many states controlled by the Democratic party are clearly leading the way in defying existing federal law, by legalizing marijuana. Republicans find themselves supporting the federal restrictions (charitably ascribed to their penchant for “law and order”) and generally unwilling to reconsider the laws which create these prohibitions, despite the widely-recognized irrationality and destructiveness of these laws.Abortion is another flashpoint, where Republicans are seeking strong federal prohibitions while Democrats have promoted strong federal protection for individual rights, similar to those being provided for the rights of trans-gendered people. The Republican party does not want federal protection extended to the trans-gendered, and believes that the rights of an unborn child are equal or superior to the rights of a pregnant female. Both sides agree that, in the absence of federal law, the states are free to establish any standard they choose, unless the standards affect interstate commerce.The federal government has total jurisdiction over interstate commerce, and can nullify states’ laws which affect interstate commerce adversely. This is the premise on which the NRA wants to make permits to carry concealed weapons (CCW) issued by any state to be valid in all states, but they want to do this without first establishing a federal standard for such CCW permits.",85,4,71,412,0,1
1,What are the rights of states within the United States and what is the differences in understanding of them between Democrat and Republican platforms?,Democratic Party vs. Republican Party,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Oh boy, this is a classic!Here’s how the game works.A Republican President is in office. A Democratic state will claim states’ rights to counteract federal power (we can see this happening right now in California with the governor vowing to go against Trump’s crackdown on sanctuary cities).A Democratic President is in office. A Republican state will claim states’ rights to counteract federal power.Usually, states’ rights claims are just a big middle finger to the White House.However, for the sake of understanding this long-held American debate further, I’m going to bring you back to an old history tale from the eighteenth-century.In the beginning there was Washington. After the ratification of plans (a.k.a. the Constitution in 1787) for the new country, Father Washington retired to Mount Vernon and left two squabbling ”angels” to fight over his throne.One of the ”angels” was named Alexander Hamilton. To many Americans (except Nothern elites), Hamilton was the devil. They claimed that he only valued industrial growth and the expansion of federal powers.Then there was the other ”angel” named Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson was loved by common folk and believed in expanding democratic values through states’ rights. Also, he was very pro French Revolution.The two ”angels” couldn’t agree on politics and by the beginning of the nineteenth-century, they had formed two political parties. Hamilton formed the Federalist party and Jefferson the Democratic-Republican party.The two factions split the nation into two opposing camps. The Jeffersonians were pro liberty and believed in states’ rights (similar to the model under the Articles of Confederation). Jefferson and another Founder named James Madison, went on to draft the Virginia and Kentrucky Resolutions which argued that states had the right to disobey federal decrees.The Hamiltonians were pro government and stressed its importance in developing the nation’s trade and industry. Hamilton’s financial plan was pro tariff, pro Northern industry, and pro British (As a side note, Hamilton was a British fanatic. The guy adored the Brits more than anything).Eventually, these two parties - along with their respective leaders, passed away; but the debate between federal and state powers continued to grow stronger by the day. In fact, the struggle between government authority came to a climax during the mid nineteenth-century.The period is 1840–1870. We begin with president Andrew Jackson - a staunch states’ rights advocate. Most notably, Jackson vetoed the rechartering of Hamilton’s national bank - which had recently expired. He instead favored the distribution of money to several “pet banks” across the states as a way of expanding wealth towards backcountry farmers.Ironically, a couple of years later during the Nullification Crisis over the 1828 Tariff (also known as the Tariff of Abominations by Sounterners) states’ rights leader John C. Calhoun led a movement in South Carolina to nullify the tariff. Jackson, despite his pro state views sent the federal military down South to force Calhoun to comply with the tariff. Jackson even said that he would lynch Calhoun himself if he refused to cooperate. This just goes to show that states rights claims are just a way to fuss about federal provisions and executive orders.But way! There’s more to this exciting tale!Enter Abraham Lincoln. On the night of his election, South Carolina secedes from the Union - again claiming states’ rights triumph federal power. Fast forward past a bloody war and Lincoln attempts to pass the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments but is shot and killed by John Wilkes Booth (again claiming states’ rights).Here comes Andrew Johnson - Lincoln’s vice-president. Like Andrew Jackson, Johnson is also a states’ rights advocate. However, he absolutely despised Southern planters and wanted revenge on them after the war. So, despite his prostate views, he pursued federal ratification of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments AND declared martial law in the South to enforce them!The parties continue to seesaw back and forth about federal versus state powers. They have both preempted states’ rights at similar rates (although the Republicans have done so slightly more than Democrats between 1999–2016 according to the Washington Post).You see kids, the moral of the story is that states’ rights are only good when you need them to be. Once you’re the president of the United States, states’ rights are old news.",104,0,23,54,0,0
1,What are the rights of states within the United States and what is the differences in understanding of them between Democrat and Republican platforms?,Democratic Party vs. Republican Party,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"(A2A) Let's address those in reverse:Ignore platforms, because neither party abides by them. They are bait.Party members themselves have different degrees of association to individual planks of their platforms, so on and so forth.This is going to get confusing so let me define a couple terms:“Statist” is someone who wants strong centralized government (in the US, this is the federal government in Washington, D.C.). In Europe, a country is also a nation is also a state. In America, each individual state is supposed to function individually with a core set of rules (US Constitution). So that's why a “statist” is one that wants central focused in D.C.“Federalist” is someone who wants states rights under a federal umbrella (again, the US Constitution). Although, the terms “Federalist"" and “anti-Federalist” got bandied about, mixed, stirred, and swapped in the 1800s whereby maybe a “Federalist” is really an “anti-Federalist.”At any rate, the terms are backwards from how they appear.“Liberals” appear in both political parties, wanting their lifestyle to be forced on others. So “Liberal” (in the current iteration) doesn't mean “liberal,"" either.“Conservatives” are trying to maintain something. There are “Constitutional Conservatives,” “Social Conservatives,” and “Fiscal Conservatives.” When someone just throws out the term “Conservative,” you have to look at context what kind of conservative is under attack. Many Conservatives are all three, however. The problem is that in America, the Modern Conservative is the “Classical Liberal” (wanting freedom and equality for all) and gets lumped into hastily generalized straw man ad hominem attacks by Liberals who minimize everything to party politics and identity politics.Clear as mud?That said, neither party gives two whits about state's rights. Both parties want their rules to apply to everyone else.Outside of pure party affiliation, Liberals are generally Statists and Conservatives are generally Federalists, but even those lines get blurred as a Statist Liberal suddenly loves state's rights if they feel a personal issue is under attack and Federalist Conservatives are often too eager to forget the people who disagree have the right to live as they please, too.",14,0,24,362,0,0
1,What are the rights of states within the United States and what is the differences in understanding of them between Democrat and Republican platforms?,Democratic Party vs. Republican Party,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"This is a great question and I’m enjoying the answers. This generally falls into two camps—all rights not detailed in the Constitution belong to the states and, all rights not detailed in the Constitution might belong to the Federal government. This falls apart because so much can get stuffed into the Commerce Clause (Article One, Section 8, Clause 3) That link is to Cornell’s Legal Information Institute which is a great resource.Historically GOP has been the party of limited government and so tends to advocate for state’s rights where the Dems tend to be for ensuring consistent rights across the states and tend to be more for more power to the national government.Currently both parties change their views based on what gets them what they want. My personal view is for national-level requirements for things like voter ID. When it comes to national elections national requirements make sense When it comes to what’s on the driver’s license test, it makes sense to vary by state because of the differences in weather, terrain and, amount of traffic.

As others have pointed out, putting it simply (there are many variables within the parties), Democrats are more accepting of federal power OVER the states and Republicans are more likely to accept states as having final say. That said, both will flip flop as issues are brought up.Regardless of which side it is, ALL states must abide by the US Constitution which supersedes any state Constitution. States rights are somewhat of a misnomer at this point, as the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments have effectively reduced state constitutions worthless. Now, people on both sides will dispute this. The originalists will expound on the Founders NOT wanting a strong central government centered in DC and the ‘other side’, mainly liberals, will state while this is true, all US citizens have constitutional rights which cannot be abridged by any state constitution. This is the side I believe to be correct. AND may be contradictory to the intent of the constitution. Especially in matters for which there is no BOR specific protection. A prime example is gay marriage, There is nowhere in the constitution that addresses marriage as a ‘right’ or protected status. It is now in the legal code primarily to address tax and property ownership issues. SCOTUS addressed it and afforded protection based on the equal protection clause, as some states opposed to gay marriage, redid state constitutions to address marriage directly and make it legal only if between a man and woman. Since this would cause conflict if a gay couple married in one state and moved to another that didn’t recognize gay marriage it would put them in a legal jeopardy. SCOTUS declared this to be a untenable situation and made gay marriage legal in all states.Basically, the debate continues.",40,1,44,807,0,0
1,What are the rights of states within the United States and what is the differences in understanding of them between Democrat and Republican platforms?,Democratic Party vs. Republican Party,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"States are granted the right to regulate all things which are not outlined in the constitution as a listed power of the federal government. This is explicitly and unequivically stated.How do Democrats understand this? They believe that the commerce clause within the Constitution allows them nearly every power they want to be applied at the federal level. This was their argument for Obamacare: people travel between states, therefore the feds need to regulate health care at the federal level as it affects every single person. This is the part that the republicans are very much against. They have chosen to say that the commerce clause does not allow the feds to regulate this and it is up to each state to figure it out at the state level.I can't think of many, but I'm sure that the republicans have their own slew of partisan issues where they rely on the commerce clause to boost the size of the Federal government, too.What Democrats don't seem to understand about Republicans/libertarians/trumpists wanting to dismantle the EPA and the DoEdu is that there is nothing stopping each state from doing whatever the hell it wants once the power to regulate is handed back over to them.One of the most beautiful things I've seen that proves this to the skeptical is the recent push to form an interstate pact to bypass the electoral college by requiring EC reps to vote for the popular winner. There's nothing illegal about it, and each state gets to decide if it wants to be part of that. There's nothing stopping every state in the union from joining the Paris climate Accord, as has been proven by the numerous states and counties which has said it will abide by it despite Trump pulling out.Trump doesn't care if we all follow the paris Accord.. I'm sure he sees it as valuable in many ways…but as a more Libertarian valued politician than Obama and Pelosi, he wants people to have the decision over it…let local politicians who are much more bound to their local populace implement such policies and back out of them if it negatively affected it's people. Therefore, if I don't like it, I can move to another state. Over time, each state will come to truly have it's own identity again. I love that idea.This is why libertarians generally identify with Republicans more than Democrats. Dems are always trying to use the commerce clause to justify making the whole country follow one rule (usually created by California or New York). Libertarians are generally more Jeffersonian… one of Trump's favorite presidents, and I'm sure Ted Cruz's as well.Someone needs to answer with the ways in which Republicans are alike in terms of amassing federall power despite the explicit limits of the Constitution. Certainly, I think the idea of trying to regulate marriage is a big stupid one, but not too harsh on the economics, which affects more people more fully than little social issues.

The President also stated he didn’t know about the payments. If this were true, it might amount to an illegal campaign contribution by Cohen, but since then the lawyer and the President have both admitted they were lying initially.Another 1.3 million dollars was paid by the President’s lawyer, who has essentially no clients besides the President, to another Playboy Model to be quiet about her affair and subsequent abortion. This was ostensibly for a different Republican politician/activist who gave large amounts of money to the Trump campaign.Russians with connections to organized crime then paid the President’s lawyer large sums of money ($500,000 in the investigation you reference) even though the lawyer didn’t do any work for them.

5,Who are some of the potential viable Democratic candidates for US President in the next election cycle?,US Presidential Elections,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"The first means to determine viability is to look at which candidates grassroots Democrats will be willing to vote for.I’ve been doing semi-monthly instant runoff surveys of my fellow NYC grassroots Dems since late 16; I’ve now conducted 25 such surveys. I conduct them at large get-togethers of Dem activists, such as candidate appearances, Democratic club meetings, etc. etc. I’m not interested in average Democrats; I’m interested in high-information high-involvement Democrats, because these are the thought-leaders who will influence average Democrats. In 05/06, these surveys of mine predicted a two-way Obama/Clinton race with Edwards nowhere, while all the analysts and pundits were saying Hillary was the favorite, Edwards was her chief rival and Obama would be an also-ran. Obviously my surveys were right and the pundits were wrong. So I’ve come to trust my surveys over the years.This time around, they’re telling me that this race has already gelled; support is not scattered, folks are not unsure. There are four candidates who consistently receive majority support/approval, and only four. In order of preference, they are Warren, Biden, Booker and Harris. That’s it.So, from among those candidates, which ones are viable?I’d eliminate Booker first. He’s very close to Wall Street and the establishment, an association that was the kiss of death for Hillary. He’d lose big in a general election.That leaves Warren, Biden and Harris.Warren has very solid support. She has support not only from those who liked, but are no longer supporting, Sanders (Sanders is doing terribly in my surveys, by the way; I suspect his fifteen minutes are over and done) but also from many less liberal Dems who think she has eloquence and an edge as a woman (not everyone has swallowed the Koolaid that, since the terrible candidate Hillary didn’t win, a woman can’t win). I mentioned that I’ve been using instant runoff in my surveys which yields a far more complete and accurate picture than the pathetic first-past-the-post polls. And Warren’s great strength is not only that she attracts strong first-choice support but also a healthy complement of second, third and fourth choice votes. That is why she has retained the lead in my surveys since I started conducting them.All of which means that she would be a strong favorite if she got the nomination. But would she win the general election? The air is replete with screams that Warren is too liberal and middle America will never accept her. Well, I heard those same screams when Barack Obama was running to Hillary’s left in the 07/08 campaign. And he won. He won because he energized, enthused and inspired the base, and also got just enough blue-collar white votes in the heartland states of Iowa, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin to win the election. No, he didn’t win a majority of the latter. No, he didn’t win a majority of independents in 2012. But he won enough of both of them to win, because he had the base behind him, and behind him solidly. Warren can win because she too will have the solid base behind her, and because people are underestimating her ability to hold her own in blue-collar areas that will be receptive to an anti-Wall Street pro-Main Street message.Close at her heels is Joe Biden. Biden is trusted and liked by most people, with very low negatives. After experimenting with a know-nothing no-resume man-child, the country will buy Biden as the sort of experienced leader we now need. And he has strength in those states which Obama won and Hillary lost, like Iowa, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Moreover, as an elder statesman, he will also be able to pick a young veep who can plausibly run for president in 2028 (that was one of Obama’s mistakes; he should have picked a younger person for his veep, someone, unlike Biden, who would have been a logical, and more charismatic, successor).Finally there is Kamala Harris. Harris is a wild card. She has started playing footsie with Clinton Inc. since she got the promotion from CA Attorney General to senator. That may be a mistake. If she’s setting herself up as the Hillary successor, good luck with that. The party DOES NOT WANT another Hillary, I can virtually guarantee that. If she does that, she will either lose the nomination big, or, if the establishment rigs things to give her the nomination, we will see a repeat of the Hillary disaster, where the base simply won’t turn out and vote in the general election. On the other hand, she’s charismatic and she’s young. If she decides she’s got some ovaries, and runs as her own person, she could be the Barack Obama of 2020, and take it all. The choice is up to her. Right now, I’d say it’s 50–50 whether she decides to be a woman or a tool. It will be interesting to watch her and find out her decision.So that’s my answer: Biden and Warren are both viable, though Warren’s greater appeal to the base makes her the stronger candidate, I think. As for Harris, there’s no way of knowing yet, because Harris has not yet decided who she is. If she makes the right identity choice, she too will be an effective and viable candidate.No point in talking about anyone else, since all other candidates have insufficient support to win the nomination.Do I think these are the very strongest candidates Dems can run? Nope; there are others I prefer. But people who are just as plugged in as I am, just as knowledgeable, just as involved, just as active, have rejected all the other roughly three-dozen candidates in my surveys, and it’s not because of name recognition; these respondents know damn well who Chris Murphy is; they know damn well who Tulsi Gabbard is; they know damn well who Sherrod Brown is. And they’re simply not buying them, that’s the bottom line.I think we have to get used to, and accept, the fact that Booker, Biden, Harris or Warren will be the nominee. No one else need apply, unfortunately.",134,0,13,64,0,0
5,Who are some of the potential viable Democratic candidates for US President in the next election cycle?,US Presidential Elections,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"There’s a long list of possibilities, but the point is you’d think they could elect a ham sandwich if it would point out the unsustainable deficits Trump’s budget is causing; how his tax cuts for the wealthy are going mostly into the pockets of CEOs and investors, while wages remain stagnant; how Trump’s tariffs are already costing good jobs and will cost many more; how Trump doing Putin’s and Kim’s bidding and Congressional Republicans failing to call it out amount to treason; how deregulating pollution of air and water is harmful (duh!); how ignoring climate change — not just ignoring, but suppressing the science — is suicidal; how attacks on journalism, fair voting, and public education threaten the most basic protections against despotism.It’d be nice for the sandwich to point out why the current, always-failed, Reaganonomic approach to government spending is inimical to thriving capitalism: moving even more money out of the hands of middle class people, workers, retirees, means fewer people with the means to buy stuff. Increasing yacht production is fine and dandy, but it’ll only float boats, not the economy.Sadly, Democratic leadership is brilliant at stepping on their own message, and too many of their voters demand an impossible level of purity and, therefore, rationalize not voting, or voting for a silly third party choice (Jill Stein! OMG!!)Between that, and red-state voter-roll purging, cynical voter ID laws, and general laziness on the part of non-voters, it probably doesn’t matter whom they pick. And if Congress remains in Republican control, and if Trump is reelected (like Buddy Cianci, from prison?), the taking down of our republic by Republicans in the thrall of big business, fossil fuels, and Russia, will be complete.

5,Who are some of the potential viable Democratic candidates for US President in the next election cycle?,US Presidential Elections,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"It’s July 16, 2018, which means that anyone seriously contemplating running for the Democratic nomination in 2020 is getting to work now, though mostly behind the scenes. So this is mostly guesswork! Just keep that in mind.Joe Biden will be too old by 2021 (77 by the time he’d take office) to be a credible Democratic standard-bearer. He’s also run several times before, which means he’s a bit of old news.Bernie Sanders is in something of the same boat - he’d be 78 by January 2021 - and though he’s got lots of appeal among progressives, I suspect there’s still a lot of anger at him over the results of the 2016 election. Quite a few Democrats seem to blame his supporters for not showing up and voting for Sec. Clinton.Cory Booker is an interesting possibility, but his resume’s a little thin for the Presidency - before becoming a Senator in 2013, he was the mayor of Newark. Nothing against Newark, but a mayorship isn’t typically seen by voters as tremendously helpful experience for the Presidency.Elizabeth Warren is another interesting prospect, but one whose age makes it a challenge. No one doubts Sen. Warren’s cachet with liberals, but she’d be 71 by January 2021. That’s not to say it’d be impossible for her to win the nomination, of course, but my suspicion is that the Democratic activists that will decide the primaries will be more appreciative of a younger progressive candidate.Which is what leads me to…Kamala Harris.Sen. Harris (D-CA) is a rising liberal star. She represents a massively populous state with a dominant Democratic Party, and thus she can tap untold millions in fundraising, especially if she can get Silicon Valley’s attention early. She’s younger than most of the competition - she’ll be 55 in January 2021 - but has won statewide elections in California three times now. And along with the others on this list, she seems to be taking some necessary steps - endorsing candidates, fundraising, and otherwise raising her national profile.There’s a long way to go before the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary, but I wouldn’t be surprised to see Sen. Harris’s campaign catch fire with progressives.",11.5k,117,9k,"3,522",1,0
5,Who are some of the potential viable Democratic candidates for US President in the next election cycle?,US Presidential Elections,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"From what I’ve seen the most ambitious and viable option is Bernie Sanders. He is an outsider, ruthlessly critical of Wall Street and big banks, an economic Nationalist and the most likely candidate to push universal healthcare.This combination makes him attractive to the suddenly energized hard left but also to a not insignificant portion of the Trump Bloc Of Voters, the grievance column. The downside is that he very likely scares the moderate Republicans who will covertly vote against a presumptive Trump re-election bid.Sanders has National name recognition and it would be laughably easy to restart his ground operation. In the last election he proved to be the most effective fund raiser in the bunch and his fund raising was all in small donations from individual citizens.The second most obvious candidate is Joe Biden. VP Biden is honestly retired but President Trump visibly pisses him off. Enough so that he might actually run just to fight with Trump directly. He won’t run if Trump doesn’t run though. Biden is extremely popular on the Left and with moderates. He’s not a Bank darling and he has one of the better labor records in Washington. He is very attractive to the older, Pre-Clintonian Democrats who’ve been marginalized by the Corporatists and some of them flipped to Trump.Sanders and Biden are old though. Age matters here. Biden would be, by far, the oldest President ever sworn in. He is realistically a one term option. This is actually a tactical advantage because that makes him even more palatable to moderate RepublicansThen we have to acknowledge the 300lb gorilla in the room. Hillary Clinton still looks like a candidate. She has not officially retired. She would be a disaster but does anyone in the DNC have the gonads to sit her down and tell her NO?Once we get these 3 out of the way the field opens up a bit.Three governors are optionally attractive.Gov. Hickenlooper from Colorado has a stellar record of managing a polarized electorate and effectively managing a cash strapped budget. He’s not bad on camera and he seems genuinely likable if a little nerdy.Gov. Jerry Brown of California has run California off and on for Decades and at this point we have to acknowledge he’s actually good at running a massive economy. He has a tangible record to run on. He is also the oldest option in the country. Despite this he still manages to pull off old guy cool.His Lieutenant Governor is a runaway Abercrombie and Fitch model who sounds great on a microphone and looks like the modern technocrat. Gavin Newsome. He’s the youngest option and only a Lt. gov but he’s the LtGov of the world’s 6th largest economy. He’s had lots of time with Jerry Brown and the media is going to fawn over him. If the Democrats want something different, he’s different.Massachusets has a pretty good Governor too. He is also good with media and has a decent record to run on. He’s an insider but not a Clintonian loyalist. He’s the most mainstream option.The Senate has some other options, Senators struggle in Presidential elections typically but this is a weird year.Elizabeth Warren is a liberal darling but I’m not seeing it. Her manner of speech doesn’t lend itself to swaying undecided voters. She is a viable hard left grab for VP but she just isn’t good as an attack warden.Kirsten Gillibrand has less liberal bonafides but her voice is lyrical and attacking her will be much more difficult since she seems to remind everyone of their childhood best friend’s mom. She started her political life as a Republican but she got swiped by the New York Clintonians and that’s gonna be a hurdle. The amount of New York in the current administration could be a challenge but it could also be an asset, for her, in tactics. She’s been pushing purging the Democrats of handsy men and in that she is part of a cultural phenomena that is transcendant of Politics. When the old boys in the Senate have tried to out maneuver her she has typically won because she is the only democratic politician at that level who has mastered the “mom act” which Republicans are strangely vulnerable too. Trump is not a normal Republican though.Cory Booker wants to be President. I’m not sure if he can pull it off yet. He’s not Barack Obama, that hurts and he won’t escape the inevitable comparisons.Kamala Harris is running. I won’t believe she isn’t until the conventions are over. She has the double barreled shotgun of Identity Politics, she’s black and a woman. She is tougher than most of her male counterparts and her tongue is a tomahawk when necessary. She throws shade better than Michelle Obama. She has been judicious in her media appearances and that discipline will serve her well in a campaign. When she chooses to answer questions her speech pathology is not Political gobbledygook and she conveys all of the necessary intent. That’s powerful. She was a DA and an Attorney General and an aggressive prosecutor so if she doesn’t secure the nomination she’s going to be a top choice for VP because when you need an attack dog she has all of the tools to savage your opponents. If she gets to savage the obsequious Mike Pence in a debate, the highlights will live forever on YouTube because his BS deflections will get eviscerated. Likewise there is no chance that Trump gets to intimidate her like Clinton in the townhall because she looks like the type to execute a Randy Savage Elbow drop.Sherrod Brown. He’s boring but competent. He sounds great in sound bites and looks like a teamster. So in a tough guy vs toughguy square off I give him an edge over Trump. He’s quite popular in Ohio and that means he probably wins Ohio and that’s a major strategic advantage in Presidential elections.You know Tim Kaine is thinking about it but I don’t think he looked that great in his last outting. He is potentially attractive since Virginia is a part of the New South that Democrats will need going forward.I don’t think it’s Adam Schiff’s time. I know Democrats like him but he is no less politicized than Devin Nunes and that stigma will carry baggage.Ted Lieu on the other hand might be a nice change of pace. He represents Beverly Hills which is a Con but he’s also an Air Force Colonel with a solid military record, he an eternal optimist and he’s been trolling the President playfully on Twitter for more than a year. He always looks surprised on TV but that isn’t as big a negative as it should be. He’s an Asian American and that might help since the racists in this country seem to have accepted that North Asians are smarter and with Lieu as a Vet he secures a typically Conservative bloc. He’s really new and that’s inexperience but I don’t think that matters with the electorate like it did. Lieu is the most congenial politician on the Democratic side and that’s a big Pro.Then there is Tammy Duckworth. Now ordinarily I wouldn’t put her in as an obvious choice but she’s a vet, a wounded vet, with small kids working two effective jobs. She’s loud, opinionated, bawdy, cantankerous and overworked. So she’s perfectly representative of regular America. I’m not sure if she can pull off the polished world leader look but I also suspect she wouldn’t try and that’s a big advantage with getting Trump voters. She’s also strangely ethnically neutral in a way where she will subconsciously appeal to a wide cross section of voters and since getting blown up with an IED didn’t slow her down, at all, the chauvinist view that women aren’t tough enough to be President will collapse under her withering gaze. All of that said, I don’t think she will run in 2020 but is a potential in 2024, when her kids are a little bit older.The real question is the spoilers. The Democrats might run a celebrity. Oprah is openly discussed but George Clooney looks like a President, has more foreign policy experience than most of Congress and the wider country just likes him.Then there are the Mark Cuban types who might get folded in on a Democratic ticket. He’s not a Democrat but neither was Sanders. Cuban could be a dangerous candidate, if he’s willing to blind trust his massive portfolio of assets.Trump broke s glass wall between capitalists and presidents and while he’s been pretty ugly in this regard the Duopoly might have a devil of a time getting this genie back in the bottle. More billionaires and near billionaires are going to run and they will bring that Trumpian swagger of certainty that career politicians lack.",1.4k,3,275,"1,378",0,0

It remains to be seen if Sanders will endorse King.However, Sanders does champion ranked choice voting which would allow for the political landscape to change and give Independents and third-parties more sway.But Sanders does not endorse the Democrats current position and the Democrats have no love for Sanders[1], so he has all the right in the world to be an Independent and to support the candidates he believes in, even if they are Democrats.Sanders is trying to influence the politics of the country, that includes some tactical endorsements, but more championing policy he believes will help the working people of this country.Footnotes[1] Bill Clinton to Tom Perez: Don't Let the Party Go to Bernie Folks",39,0,140,"2,333",0,1

UK Liberals are stubborn, but overall are still jolly nice, intelligent & rational.US Liberal Progressives are closer to the UK Labour Party, both include many closet racists, anti-Semites, anarchists & Islamist's, along with defending the position of illegal immigrants over the nationals, simply to garner more support/votes.And so whilst our Conservatives are more liberal than US Conservatives, their leaning should not be confused with much of Europe, which was Federalist Liberal. For me these Federalists are progressives aka neo Marxists in disguise, favoring dictatorial governance & make decisions that are contra their citizens wishes, primacy laws, security & safety, by open borders, un-vetted immigration & kow towing to Shar’ia , much of which should sound familiar if you reflect on US Democrat progressives.And as you know, that which the left call ‘populism’, or wrongly, but for a derogation reason ‘ultra right’, but I call the ‘mind set of true Democracy & Common Sense’, is on the rise, and will prevail, despite the Liberal censorship of their media.",49,1,27,417,0,0

We control a fair bit of oil and gas, but it’s mostly within British territorial sea and land areas, so we have less to fight over. Healthcare is universal and good.

Are they going to develop a platform? A platform that prioritizes our nation and our citizens? All political BS aside, our nation has laws. And laws are in place for oh so very many reasons. And, “resist anything and everything” is NOT a platform.I continually read democrats justify their current mantra likening said mantra to the republican position during the Obama administration. And that’s fair, to a point. To clarify, republicans chose to stand specifically against the ACA. Why? Because it was bad policy all around. I mean really, if in-part architect, Jonathon Gruber, bounced around from one lecture to the next talking about how the ACA’s language and construction had to be formed such that it required “the stupidity of the American people” in its deception of hiding what was a massive tax hike; and, implored Nancy Pelosi to so-excitedly exclaim that “we’d know what was in the bill AFTER it was passed”, one can only draw one conclusion (at least I did)…. SHADY!!!Look, I won’t say that the idea of providing healthcare to all isn’t a noble idea. It is, for sure. Unfortunately, the manner in which that was attempted, while it benefitted SOME, it FUCKED A WHOLE LOT MORE.So, personally, I believe there are other ways to go about providing access to more people such that the very least among us are as absolutely minimal as can be. It wasn’t Obamacare.There’s no perfect system; everyone WILL NOT win; there will always be the wealthy and ultra-wealthy, who combined, pay the overwhelming portion of our annual tax burden where most in our lower 50% of earners, after credits and such, pay nothing at all. Somebody somewhere is going to lose, something. That’s life. LIFE IS NOT FAIR!With these realities in mind, we saw what was becoming of and what will become of the ACA were it to move forward untouched. It is completely unsustainable.Further, while after 8 years of President Obama’s policies did ultimately show signs of improvement; however slow and painful to many, as “captain of his ship” (the USA) he will own that fact: his progressive, pro government, massive regulation policies stifled the private sector such that its ability to grow, flourish and expand was p a i n f u l l y slow. “HOPE & CHANGE WAS A FAILURE”. It sounded cute, but it wasn’t. THERE WERE NO SHOVEL READY JOBS. See, government doesn’t create jobs. The private sector does. And when the government needs revenue, revenue is sucked in from the private sector.ENTER PRESIDENT TRUMP: (I’m tired of keying all the improvements but a few are as follows)Decreased unemploymentDecreased welfare recipientsIncreased GDPHistoric low unemploymyment amongst our black communitiesMajor companies with cash combined in the trillions repatriating at a lowered corporate tax rate investing in America’s job growthMany regulations written by the Obama administration UNDONE freeing up the private sector to grow againGlobal terrorism, at a minimum, in complete hiding, but hopefully near exterminatedPolitics and media aside, our allies stand with us against Assad in SyriaPOTUS did IN FACT, bring the Korea’s together to talk and continue onward with denuclearizationPOTUS is absolutely working hard to see that America is no longer getting FUCKED on trade deals.So, what will happen to democrats if they lose the 2018 midterm? Nothing more than continue with their “resist this, that and any and all things” while working even harder to subvert our nation’s laws in aiding & abetting illegal citizens, insisting that we Americans, regardless of our heritage, should discontinue our American ideals and heritage to be more sensitive to those we may “offend”. They’ll continue to beat that dead ol’ horse of Russian collusion and dossier narritive which was IN FACT of their own making and doing, looking for anything possible to continue driving their wedges amongst us: rich & poor, young & old, white & black all alike.I laugh when I hear democrats say that today’s positive economic indicators are a result of President Obama. No, it took conservative policy to make this kind of turn. President Reagan did it too.Personally, I’m overly exhausted hearing the daily BS, conjecture and POTUS said this or that…blah, blah, blah. If things we say are qualifiers for attaining the presidency, NO ONE WOULD MAKE IT TO THE PRESIDENCY. And for that matter, we have a first amendment protecting speech. While some of what POTUS has said has been drawn far out of line from context and meaning, at the end of the day, what POTUS says means nothing to the improvement of our economy. Results do. And without question, POTUS is doing a helluva job! Frankly, I’m not sure he even goes to sleep.Anyone can throw all the mud they want my direction to my post but the results of POTUS’s policies are what tell the story. Had HRC been elected, Lord knows 2 things with all certainty:All the DNC corruption, true collusion with Russia, the dossier, CGI shadiness all would’ve been swept under the rug and buried.We simply wouldn’t be seeing the improvements in the economy as we are today.LITTLE FACTOID: this is in no way meant to serve as a lowering of expectations but it’s true that democrats will pick up seats this midterm.

Do they want to rule the world and remake it in their likeness? NO! Some of the subgroups that make up the democratic party base are ideological in nature; ncome distributionists, socialist etc. Others are there only there for the spoils of power, which in this case is plain “handouts”.A party made up of nothing but self interest will not be able to govern very well but it should be able to win power.

I would not be surprised at all if the disparate contingents of the party all break out in absolute anger at the people of America. Riots, violence and detestation of the other side will probably reach levels not seen since 1968.It was in that year that a youthful culture felt the country cheated them by first allowing JFK, RFK and MLK to be assassinated. Then they felt the country covered up their sins with the Warren Commission, which no one but a hick in Alabama believed in. And to take insult and ram it down your throat the country elected LBJ, a disgusting human being that was repugnant to most of the youth. To see the charismatic and youthful JFK replaced by LBJ meant this pot stank and stank badly. (Does it sound a bit like Obama being replaced by Trump?)So out came the banners, out poured the youth and the country entered a period of shock and disbelief. I would expect much the same reaction form the youth of today, even though they are far less interventionist and far far more self indulgent then their 1970s brothers. However there are many more subgroups that will join the armada, unlike in 1968.Women will be there in droves, they were by and large absent in the 70s. Blacks will join as well, blacks were again by and large absent except for the fringe violent fragments. And of course the students will be there leading them. There is a core of white students right now that are extremely violent. While they do not represent the majority of the “Katy Perrified”, “my brain is dead” group - they are extremists and very violent!How the violent subgroup will or will not be able to lead the “my brain is dead” majority remains the quotient under which America might burn or feel a tremor that rapidly goes away.

1,Why do Republicans hate Democrats?,Democratic Party vs. Republican Party,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Sometime during the Reagan Presidency, many Republicans started feeling that their party had a God-given right to rule the government, and whenever Democrats took over, it was unpatriotic, because Republican rule was the natural patriotic order of things. It didn’t matter if Democrats had more votes, it was still unnatural (according to many Republicans) for Democrats to rule, because it didn’t feel right to them.If felt so good to them when Reagan was President. Surely, it couldn’t be right for anyone to take that good feeling away.Bush-I didn’t feel as right as Reagan, but that was because he was a Republican-In-Name-Only because he raised taxes. He didn’t count.Clinton was an abomination, mostly because he wasn’t a member of the Republican party. His policies (other than a tax raise) were not THAT different what a Republican would have done, but his big crime was not having an R beside his name, because that besmirched the memory of the blessed Reagan. It didn’t matter that Clinton cut welfare down to the bone and into the bone and drastically increased the number of black people we sent to prison - how dare he be President and not be a Republican? It was insulting.At the beginning of his Presidency, Bush-II didn’t really seem like he completely knew what he was doing, but he had that wonderful Dick Cheney to tell him, and he grew in the office when he decided to bomb Iraq in response to 9–11. Then he was a gift from God. Bush-II was literally proof of God’s love of America, because a Democratic President wouldn’t have had the spine to bomb a country that didn’t really cause 9–11, but should be bombed anyway because it was full of Arabs (and oil). God truly blessed America by giving us Bush-II.But then Obama stole the Presidency, and not only was he black, but even worse, he was not a Republican! He couldn’t really be an American, and that must mean God did not love America any more (probably because America had aborted too many babies).And that’s why Republicans hate Democrats - it is because they aren’t Republicans.",61,4,979,"3,479",0,0

I can think of at least two good answers:All rejections of nominees in the past have been based on something other than “We don’t like the president.” For many years, it was difficult to block a Supreme Court or other judicial nominee without finding some kind of dirt — they were unqualified, they were corrupt, etc. Only a few were blocked for political reasons alone. Later, Democrats, frustrated with Jimmy Carter getting no Supreme Court nominations, but Reagan and Geroge H.W. Bush getting several each, finally decreed that they would reserve the right to reject nominations who were too far “out of the philosophical mainstream” of American jurisprudence.But even such an assertion of power—which Reagan objected to at the time—implied that the Democrats would consider any nominee and have a real discussion over whether that nominee was acceptable BEFORE turning that candidate down. That, in turn, invited the President of the opposting party to hold out a “compromise” appointment.The latest Repuoblican maneuver went far, far beyond any earlier Senate declaration. What they said was that because Obama was in opposing party, they would deliberately lock the president out of the process entirely, hoping to elect another president, though Obama had almost a year to go.Another thing that was absolutely unprecedented was that the Republican Senate would not even give Obama’s appointment the dignity of having hearings to consider him.In short, I think this move by the Republican Senate to be one of the saddest days for our Constitution. To pursue a different political and judicial philosophy is one thing, but to lock the president completely out of the process (even though the Constitution makes the president the primary source of appointments) and then use an upcoming election to “game the system,” comes very close to a willful overturning of the Constitution.",20.2k,333,1.7k,"4,628",0,0

There was also the Bork filibuster during the Reagan administration.The difference there is that they were given their hearing and were blocked using the rules of confirmation in the Senate (at the time). Garland wasn’t even given a hearing. He wasn’t filibustered by Republicans. Obama didn’t get the chance to submit a different nominee. That’s how the process is supposed to work. If two-thirds of the Senate can’t approve, then the President submits a new nomination; hopefully one more likely to be approved. What was different with the Garland situation was that he was not even given a hearing. He wasn’t filibustered. They simply refused to consider the nomination which was unprecedented.UPDATE 07/09/18Respoding to a couple of points raised in the comments.It appears that there were some instances of similar things happening in the 1840’s. My mistake. I guess that changes everything. So I suppose it is not truly unprecedented. But the last time it happened in a manner similar to this was before the Civil War. The last time it ever happened was immediately after the Civil War. But that instance involved Congress reducing the number of justices thereby eliminating the need for a hearing. I will concede that this does demonstrate that underhanded tactics have been used in the past to prevent a President from making a court appointment. I don’t support those maneuvers either. Whether or not this was truly unprecedented isn’t terribly important to me. I think it is still an unfair, albeit technically legal, move. It might be within the letter of the law (or rather simply not blatantly illegal) but it is certainly not in the spirit of the law. More importantly, the particular question of Bush vs Obama is still relevant. There is still a clear distinction here.The so called “Biden rule” was never executed in ‘92. That’s just something Joe Biden said. That doesn’t make him right or wrong or set an actual precedent. More importnatly though, he also said that appointments should be delayed until after the election at which point they could be confirmed before any new President took office.

Someone who encourages the fringe nutjobs need not be elected to higher office.

The Green Party decided Jill Stein was worthy of office. I may agree with many items on the Green Party platform, but that means I approve of policy positions.

The Republican Party exists to give tax cuts to billionaires and is willing to placate the racist xenophobic white nationalist fringe in order to get those tax cuts. There was a time when Republicans had a platform and candidates worthy of high office. That time has long expired. The Democratic Party is the coalition that is most capable of defeating the Republican Party. The Democratic Party will not defeat the Republican Party without my vote.

In our form of ‘democracy’, it takes the largest plurality to win. If we split our votes, some voting for Independents, some voting for Democrats, some voting for Greens, some voting for Socialists, some voting for Libertarians, then what ends up happening is the Billionaires For Tax Cuts and Rabidly Racist Fringe and the Religious Reich all vote together and they pass their despicable agenda.In short, voting for the Green Party is like looking at the Green Party platform, shitting on it, and then setting it on fire, because that’s what you’re doing to the ideas contained within that platform.There is less than zero chance they’ll be enacted if you vote for the Green Party.The Green Party is basically a ruse.

It has less infrastructure than it did, but it has some.The US Green Party as actually exists is a ballot line option by cranks and charlatans for the gullible protest vote. That’s all. It is not a social force of any substance or structure, it has no story or organization. There is nothing “there” to support, and that’s because no one has legitimately built it into anything. That only happens with a lot of social effort, a lot of organizing and planning, most of it offline where the point is not, “cater to me”. That only happens when you build something that others want to join, a language that others want to learn to speak.“Just vote Green because you don’t think the Democrats are catering to your personal political taste” doesn’t change that basic reality.If you want to get something done right now the way to do that is involvement with the Democratic Party.

What I have observed here in Kansas City, seen and heard in the media, and experienced here at Quora does not, for the most part, come across as “anger”.Democrats:Are stunned by the results of the 2016 Election. Too many of us trusted too much in the idea that “not like Trump” was a strategy for victory.Are baffled and vexed by the tacit acceptance of the Electoral College’s intrusion — by the idea that an 80,000 vote super-minority from a few counties should outweigh a 2,900,000 vote super-plurality nationally.Are horrified to see — in the Republican Base — the flowering of decades of conservative moves to create divisions between Americans, to cast certain groups as bogeymen, to sow deep distrust of government, and to weaponize fear-talk and dogwhistle language.Are disappointed, dismayed, exasperated — perhaps even disgusted at times — at the changes we have seen in family, friends, and other regular folks. We wonder how they could support an agenda — derived from nothing but fantasies — that has proven itself toxic in Michigan (Flint and Detroit), in the entire State of Kansas, and which played a major role in the Recession of 2007–12.Are at once both worried because they see that the progress made in America from 2008 to 2016, along with what remains of New Deal and Great Society Government For The People, has clearly been the sole target of the Ryan/Trump wrecking ball, and grimly determined to apply ourselves to clean up a mountain of mess here and around the world that has not been so high, wide, and wrecked in most Americans’ lifetimes.Those things are what I see and hear from Democrats. I do not see or hear “anger”.And Republicans? I suspect that much of their ranting, chanting, and authoritarian belligerence is not genuine “anger”, but rather the posturing that comes from fear, and from a suspicion that liberals and progressives actually know a thing or two, are close to 100% right in their assessment of Trump, and might be a whole lot better at loving not only their own children, but also at loving everybody’s children, including all those being raised by Republicans.Similarly, though a subset of conservatives seems to be genuinely indifferent to the misery and struggles of anyone outside their own immediate “tribe”, I also think that many conservatives might now — or soon — come to suspect that “It” is indeed “The Economy, Stupid”, “The Climate, Stupid”, “The Science, Stupid”, and “The Future, Stupid”….and I doubt that they want history to remember them as the “Stupid”. Some of that may already have happened with “former Republicans” such as Steve Schmidt, Jennifer Rubin, Joe Scarborough, Evan McMullin, George F. Will, Norm Orenstein, and David Frum — though I cannot determine how deep, lasting or uniform their reassessments have been.I have found that conservatives are less “angry” than they are fearful of change and terrified of being proved wrong — fears stoked by their media echo chamber. While the sum of their behaviors might appear to be “anger”, and occasionally veers into road-rage, conservatives are no better at withstanding the toxic effects of real chronic anger than are those of us who are liberal/progressive.“Anger” — the accusation — is most often used as a step toward claiming a moral high ground as part of an ad hominem attack.“Anger” if it exists should be the conclusion of a well-crafted analysis, and not an initial assertion or assumption .Thus, while this Question has been useful, it needs to be re-stated to give us a more thoughtful conversation and to avoid false equivalence.",291,6,76,321,0,0

Obama spent years attempting to negotiate in good faith with the Republicans. Turns out, there is no such thing as a good faith Republican. Take the 2011 budget…Republicans initially wanted $32 billion in cuts.[1]So Obama gave them $33 billion in cuts.[2] Not merely everything they asked for, but an extra billion on top.To which the Republicans then immediately demanded $61 billion.[3]They finally got $38 billion in budgets cuts in a bill that passed an hour before the deadline.[4]These are the kinds of things that are forgotten easily, but shouldn’t be. Obama literally gave the Republicans more than they asked for and they immediately rejected it to stall for another month.You can’t be civil towards people who are not making any sort of good faith effort. This is all on Republicans. If you look at the Obama administration, he bent over backwards to cater to Republicans. The largest single portion of the stimulus package was tax cuts. Specifically Republican tax cuts.The stimulus got zero Republican votes. To quote Obama…[5]Probably the moment in which I realized that the Republican leadership intended to take a different tack was actually as we were shaping the stimulus bill, and I vividly remember having prepared a basic proposal that had a variety of components. We had tax cuts; we had funding for the states so that teachers wouldn’t be laid off and firefighters and so forth; we had an infrastructure component. We felt, I think, that as an opening proposal, it was ambitious but needed and that we would begin negotiations with the Republicans and they would show us things that they thought also needed to happen. On the drive up to Capitol Hill to meet with the House Republican Caucus, John Boehner released a press statement saying that they were opposed to the stimulus. At that point we didn’t even actually have a stimulus bill drawn up, and we hadn’t meant to talk about it. And I think we realized at that point what proved to be the case in that first year and that second year was a calculation based on what turned out to be pretty smart politics but really bad for the country: If they cooperated with me, then that would validate our efforts. If they were able to maintain uniform opposition to whatever I proposed, that would send a signal to the public of gridlock, dysfunction, and that would help them win seats in the midterms. It was that second strategy that they pursued with great discipline. It established the dynamic for not just my presidency but for a much sharper party-line approach to managing both the House and the Senate that I think is going to have consequences for years to come.Footnotes[1] G.O.P.-led House Panel Proposes $32 Billion Budget Cut[2] Budget deal close with $33B in cuts[3] Republican Budget Hard-Liners Get Support from Tea Party[4] Congress Passes Budget for 2011, Sends to Obama for Signature[5] Barack Obama on 5 Days That Shaped His Presidency",863,32,437,421,1,5

Rather, the opposition, manifesting their Progressive Indoctrination at every opportunity, tend to form ever-smaller herds and factions and to also prefer strong feelings over knowledge about how to use the political system to promote their priorities into the political sphere.It is inevitable that the leftists will win in the long run, temporarily, before collapse and rebellion that their oppressive goals must ultimately result in.Nothing any of us prefer, desire, need, promote, defend or create is immune to the consequences of the continuous acceleration of the growth of oppression that is inevitable in the leftist world view.The splintered factions of individuals who ostensibly value freedom, which is merely another term for lack of oppression, must one-day abandon their self-righteous political self-marginalization and begin to intelligently use the tools available to them, today, to attempt to impose limits on the perpetual growth of oppression.

Is it realistic that one of those two parties goes away or becomes a footnote? Absolutely. Is it liklely that we effectively have a monopoly on political parties? In a free market for political parties that is doubtful. If the republicans fell away for example something would take their place.

There just aren’t really examples of 1 entity having a stranglehold on anything. With 4 trillion in other people’s money on the table I guarantee something would fill the gap on behalf of crony capitalists, unions and other special interests if nothing else. That said I am not sure we would have a free market in political parties if one party became dominant because that party would not want to allow it.The real danger of single party dominance is the same one we have in the economic world that is the political process can be used to prevent competition through legislation. This is what happened with cable companies as one example. There is also precedent for this in the political world. Both the democrats and republicans work the legislative process to prevent third parties from participating. It is certainly possible and perhaps probable that a single dominant party would try to change the laws to ensure they remain the dominant party.The only question is would the voting public allow it?

From Jan., 1933 to Jan., 1939, the democrats in Congress were so numerous, that they had enough members just by themselves, to pass a Constitutional Amendment on anything. Meaning each house of Congress had more than two-thirds of its members being democrats. In the House of Representatives, that is enough to ignore the rules, and pass laws by any means desired. It took the court packing fiasco of Roosevelt, in 1937, for the people to be enough incensed to remove the two-thirds in the House.

I think that the grassy knoll is bullshit and I grew up in Texas. My parents met and drank at the same bar that the Secret Service went to the night before the murder. It was called “The Cellar”. Dad fell off a bar stool and pissed on a case of beer, thinking that it was a bathroom and that is how I was born, 20 some odd years later. My parents were pee eyed drunk and had some difficulties with breeding but here I am!I lived less than a mile from Oswald’s grave for many years. Rosewood Cemetary.My credential is a joke. I am only a “propagandist at the deep state” as much as my dog is a propagandist for all things canine.Fake news is all news nowadays and I pay little to no attention to it.I like to play with credentials, Louis and make up silly ones and see which ones stick, simply because my actual strengths are frequently rejected by what I can only assume are bots.I have no idea why Kennedy was killed or his brother either except that there are some crazy motherfuckers out there and for some reason, Catholics were an anathema to fundamentalists and people could get away with being bigots then. I’m not a Kennedy lover and I hate seeing legacy presidents and all of that.I’m sure you selected me because of my credential which isn’t really serious but some would consider it as such.

He lived with his mother 3 blocks from my mom’s house. Here’s a picture for ya! Jimmy Gant will probably enjoy this. This is at Lily B.

He may think so, but no.Oh, but he wrote a long article for National Review!True, he did. But that doesn’t make Murdock’s views to be on point.As a former opinions page editor for a college’s student newspaper, let me say, as nicely and respectfully as possible, that this is a good opportunity to explain the difference between an opinion piece and a news story.Having written more than my fair share of opinion-based content, I instinctively can tell when an article in a newspaper or a magazine is a “news” piece or an “editorial.”This is a news article:(From: Spotify moves against R. Kelly; Robert N. Hall, whose inventions are everywhere, is dead; more in U.S. news)NationSpotify moves against R. KellyR. Kelly’s music will no longer be promoted by Spotify and has been removed from all official playlists and recommendation features, the company said Thursday, adding its voice to the growing chorus attempting to hold the singer responsible after decades of accusations of sexual misconduct. ""We want our editorial decisions — what we choose to program — to reflect our values,"" Spotify said. Last week, the Time’s Up organization, which formed around the #MeToo movement to support victims of sexual abuse, joined a grassroots #MuteRKelly campaign that has called on his record label and concert promoter, as well as venues, radio stations and streaming services, to cease its support of the platinum-selling R&B singer. R. Kelly, who for years has faced lawsuits and news reports alleging sexual coercion and abuse of young girls and women, has denied the accusations. He is not facing any criminal charges and was acquitted in 2008 in a child pornography case. His management team claims the Time’s Up campaign an ""attempted public lynching of a black man."" Spotify also debuted a new policy regarding ""hate content and hateful conduct."" It has ""thought long and hard about how to handle content that is not hate content itself, but is principally made by artists or other creators who have demonstrated hateful conduct personally."" The chart-topping rapper and singer XXXTentacion, who is facing charges in Florida that include aggravated battery of a pregnant woman and witness tampering, was also removed from playlists.This news article basically tells the What, Who, Why, Where, When, and How of Spotify’s decision to remove R. Kelly’s music from its official playlists. It does not reflect the writer’s opinion on the Spotify decision to remove two artists from its playlists or about Mr. Kelly’s personal issues. The tone is detached, factual, and simple.Now, let’s see an opinions piece.Murdock’s piece begins thusly:What will Democrats do once their entire “Resistance” narrative collapses around them, like a termite-ridden dormitory? Since Donald J. Trump’s upset victory, Democrats have “resisted” him at nearly every turn. Why? Trump, they argue, is an economically illiterate bully controlled by Moscow.But what if President Trump emerges as an economically adroit statesman, untethered to the Kremlin? He increasingly resembles the latter.Just by looking at Deroy Murdock’s article in the National Review, a reader can tell the “slant” of the column. It’s not objective in tone or intent, and though Murdock cites statistics and other data (and not in a neutral tone, either), it’s clearly a pro-Trump opinion piece aimed at a like-minded reader.Last but not least, let me make this perfectly clear:The National Review is not an unbiased publication with a mission to simply inform readers.From the magazine’s own website, Frequently Asked Questions | National ReviewNATIONAL REVIEW, INC., FAQWhat is National Review?National Review was founded in 1955 by William F. Buckley Jr. as a magazine of conservative opinion. The magazine has since defined the modern conservative movement and enjoys the broadest allegiance among American conservatives.Today, National Review publishes a magazine 24 times a year in several formats, including print and digital. National Review also produces a 24/7 website, www.nationalreview.com, which publishes a significant amount of content in addition to what’s found in the magazine. This online content includes articles, blogs, videos, podcasts, and slideshows. (For more information see the National Review website FAQ.)Deroy Murdock is giving his opinion about the Democratic Party’s reaction to President Trump and the possible effects of what may happen if the Administration’s entire agenda produces positive results.That’s all this is…opinion.Nothing more, nothing less.",4.8k,129,505,416,0,4
4,Is Deroy Murdock of the National Review on point when he indicates that Democrats have been wrong about Trump?,Democratic Party (US politics),Republican Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"Question: Is Deroy Murdock of the National Review on point when he indicates that Democrats have been wrong about Trump?Yeah…no.While he does have some valid points, he loses them rather quickly by clearly ignoring Trump’s numerous deficiencies as the POTUS and as a leader. His points really only make sense if you are a Trump supporter, you choose to ignore the man’s actions and statements as well as the history of Trump’s term in office. If that’s the case, then Trump’s been a raving success and all of the allegation- no matter their sources or accuracy- can be dismissed out of hand.Let’s review:Nearly half of the people who started with Trump are now gone from his administration…and we are only 18 months into it - That means that he not only picked a group that could not do their jobs, he picked people who he couldn’t get along with at a time when that was most important.The economy was improving under Obama -While things have been going well so far, they would have gone well regardless of who was sitting in the White House. Crediting Trump for the economy is logically similar to crediting Vladimir Putin for the current rise in oil prices: It only works if you need to link the two together. It doesn’t when you perform even the barest of due diligence.Trump’s incompetence is recorded historical fact, not an invention or the imaginings of the Democratic Party - The USFL, the Atlantic City casinos, the New York real estate market and even the failure of his single greatest achievement The Apprentice all demonstrate that he was (and is) a subpar businessman. He certainly isn’t the billionaire that he claims to be (his failure to release his tax records confirms that) and his inability to obtain loans from US banks make it clear that only his supporters believe him to be capable of doing more than screwing up in similar manners as he has done so in the past.The Mueller investigation exists because of Trump actions - Trump fired the head of the FBI, James Comes and thus necessitated the implementation fo a special prosecutor who could not be influenced by him or his action, as per US law. Worse, in less than a calendar year, Robert Mueller and his staff have obtained guilty pleas from former Trump associates and has also received their cooperation. Had Trump left the investigation or used other methods to stymie it besides blabbing about it on Twitter and Fox News, it’s likely that there would have been no action on the matter until much later in his first term. He built the fire in which he is now roasting.The Democrats are simply pointing out his flaws which, as the opposition, is what they are supposed to do - The article seems to believe that the Dems should be “on board” with Trump which is actually the opposite position of what they are supposed to be. They didn’t vote for Trump, they don’t think that he is qualified for the role, they suspect that he is involved in one or more criminal activities and they are interested in replacing him with one of their own who actually CAN do the job. To imagine that they would come around to seeing things “Trump’s way” demonstrates a keen misunderstanding of American politics.This article is so flawed that it really shouldn’t have passed the editor’s desk, much less have been printed.

This process will totally abrogate all things Reaganomics by the 2020 Presidential Election and re-elect Trump in a historic turn-out and a massive majority in the popular vote of 65 - 80%, usher in a new era of Sovereign Democracy in the United Nations and open a Trump property next door to a United Nations Space Force: Peace Keepers base on the moon,He probably won’t do that because he has to roll it out before he meets with Chairman Kim and, if he doesn’t Kim is likely to cancel the summit.Korea doesn’t need Trump to do shit. Trump is not only trailing Kim by about 70 years, he is just barely in the loop.Korea, like Vietnam, has always been a United Nations Peace Keeping, Stability Operations and Nation Building project. It’s why I went to Vietnam when John Bolton joined the Nation Guard because he was scared shitless of going to Vietnam but claims his cold-blooded estimate that it was a waste of his time.That’s where Trump and Bolton have a common valance. As a Vietnam vet, everybody in America blames the draftees for the way the war turned out in the Oliver Stone version of Vietnam and Vietnam-era National Guard pukes were some of the worst abuses of vets. Remember, they were at the point in their careers where they were doing the hiring and firing in corporate America and anything that reminded them of the 6 years thay had to endure with short hair when all the long-haired freaky people were getting laid triggered their various prejudices arising out of their generally GOP crypto-Nazi white supremancist antpathy towards Vietnam vets as nigger.Remember, the conventional wisdom is that we needed an All Volunteer Militay because of draftees. The All-Volunteer Military is a monument to the utter moral collapse of the political leadership and senior military command of the Department of Defense after Tet ‘68. I cannot begin to overstate how totally fucked up the US Army was at the Secretary of the Army/Chief of Staff level when I was in Vietnam and the All Volunteer Army is one consequence.And all those people are already on Trump’s side and that’s the people he has around him and the people who keep money flowing into Trump properties to keep the apperance of financial integrity intact. Trump won’t change because he is afraid that the cash flows coming out of the GOP Deep State supporting the illusion of economic substance in all things Trump wei dry up and everything associated with Trump will blow up .So, he’s not likely to turn his back on the National Review as a proxy for all things crypto-Nazi in America. He’e absolutely correct: if he was to re-boot Nixon’s domestic program, the criminal elements in the Deep State who want another war to suck cash out of the American middle class will turn off the cash because this pivot will expose the criminal elements in the GOP Deep State to Mueller in a very RICO kind of way (and Jeff Sessions has installed a hair-trigger on RICO seizures, hoping to catch Obama and the Clinton’s in anything Nunes, Meadowos and Gowdy could cook up like Gingrich and Delay did with impeachment but forgetting that Mueller was actually zeroing in on actionable intelligence Trump inherited from Obama.Another irony is that collusion with Putin is the one thing which can buffer all things Trump from RICO exposure because the criminal conspiracy between the GOP Deep State and the Russian Dark Web, on the one hand, and the Sovereign Democracy agenda Putin inherited from Nixon-Breznev “Detente” by way of Gorbachev and Yeltsin, on the other hand, are antagonistic agendas, Trump had to be mobbed up to do 24 property projects in Manhattan but those connections don’t connect to Putin’s Sovereign Democracy. Putin is getting ready to pull the trigger on his enemies in the Russian Dark Web, and, when he does. the truly evil criminal elements in the GOP Deep State are going to light up for Mueller and the United States Attorney’s in all jurisdictions like the 4th of July on the Nation Mall and depending on what Trump does between now and 12 July will determine his fate, one way or another.So, if Trump turns his back on the National Review. as a proxy for all things crypto-Nazi in the GOP, DeRoy Murdock of the National Review will be exactly on point with what amounts to the obituary of the National Review, as a proxy for all things crypto-Nazi in America.12 June 2018 will tell the tale.",69,1,395,"1,072",0,0

1,Why do politicians deny climate change despite having evidence of it?,Climatology,Democratic Party (US politics),Climate Change,1!,1!,1!,"Great question.Many people deny climate change, and not just the politicians, however some politicians have a vested interest in denying climate change because their political supporters want them to deny climate change. Their political supporters could be lobby groups that represent special interests. A study by Princeton University suggests that most laws in the U.S. are proposed and passed for special interests and not for voters: this is good evidence.My interpretation is that there are three key factors in climate change denial: (i) education, (ii) worldview, and (iii) vested interests.The factor of education may be obvious: if a person living in an isolated place and never reads about climate science, then he/she might not believe that the climate could change. Also, if a person strongly denies climate change, then this denial can cause confirmation bias in the interpretation of new information. Climate science is quite a sophisticated topic, and so there is plenty of scope for people to question or challenge the standard interpretation by experts.The factor of worldview is more complicated and troublesome, because a person’s worldview is shaped by personal experiences. We all need a worldview for orientation, otherwise the world is just too confusing. A person will begin developing their worldview from a young age and based on first-hand experience. Only until after 2012 did global temperatures rise so much (due to climate change) did it become obvious to the public via the media. The pre-2012 muting of climate change was because of ocean mixing that buffered temperatures for a while. This was called the ‘global warming hiatus’, and it fuelled climate change denialism.Detailed look at the global warming ‘hiatus’ again confirms that humans are changing the climateIt is not a good idea to criticise people simply because their worldview is scientifically inaccurate or wrong. We, as a species, develop our worldview based on experience. A challenge is to “see” climate change that is based on long-term data records. Climate change is not obvious when standing outside and looking at the sky. Although, in some places in the world, people can see that climate change has occurred during their lifetime (e.g. people living in the Arctic circle).A feature of the worldview is that most people absolutely hate it when their worldview is challenged. Studies show that people will not change their worldview just because of new information. It takes a lot of social pressure to change a person’s worldview, and it cannot be guaranteed to happen. For example, try convert somebody’s religion… It just can’t be done by logical arguments.The third factor is vested interests. Vested interests include commercial interests, such as fossil fuel companies. Large firms employ experts to influence public policy and tax regimes that favour them. They employ marketing people who use the media and education system to push their agenda. From the perspective of the vested interests, it would not be too difficult to find a politician who already has a worldview that is anti-climate science. The obvious strategy is to reinforce these politicians’ worldview with financial incentives and political power, and presto—an abundance of politicians who deny climate change for vested interests. This is a symbiosis between the anti-science worldview and the vested interests of commercial enterprises.This creates a viscous cycle, because these climate-denying politicians are very good at scaring people away from carbon taxes and other similar policies. Voters do not like taxes, and voters are easily scared and manipulated by political rhetoric.I hope that answers the question.D.",413,13,30,64,0,1

We saw this most recently in 2010 with the Republican absorption of the Tea Party.The Tea Party was a potential 3rd Party insurgency. One that Dick Armey neutered by enveloping it with the GOP’s hard Right Wing.If Mark Meadows becomes Speaker of the House or is voted in as minority leader what we will have seen is the Tea Party overtake the GOP. So there is some danger in subsuming a 3rd Party.There are several prominent 3rd parties in America. The Libertarians have a presence in all 50 states. The Greens in perhaps 30. The Constitutionalists in at least 5. None can seem to crack into the major positions because their most talented players get poached.Ralph Nader was the last legitimate 3rd Party challenger who refused being drafted by a major and that’s 20 years ago.The Democrats brought in Bernie Sanders to prevent a possible 3rd option challenge from a potentially spoilerific candidate.Sanders could organize a 3rd Party of Progressives.

The Tea Party theoretically organized around public debt but the money thrown at candidates eroded any principled discipline on debt among those members.So the first question to ask is what issue could coalesce a functional party around it?In what way would this theoretical party approach this issue from a policy standpoint that differs from the current Duopoly?Can this issue generate a grassroots organizational structure that will sustain a nascent party?A few years ago a couple of moderate to liberal Republicans founded a modern Whig Party for moderates of both parties. So far it has gained no traction but radical moderation is possibly a viable path to a 3rd Party insurgency.The current Campaign Finance structures make manifesting a 3rd Party difficult but in my opinion, Campaign Finance is exactly the issue to found a party on.

2,"Historically, the Democrats and Republicans have dominated politics in the US. Do you see a third party being as significant as these two in the near future?",Current Events in U.S. Politics,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"No, I don’t. But I think how the Republicans became a successful third party in 1854, and how they overpowered the Whigs without losing out to the pro-slavery Democrats, is worthy of investigation. Because that was the only time in our history when a third party rose to prominence — by drawing its members from both of the other parties.“The Republican Party began as a coalition of anti-slavery Conscience Whigs and Free Soil Democrats opposed to the Kansas–Nebraska Act, submitted to Congress by Stephen Douglas in January 1854. The Act opened Kansas Territory and Nebraska Territory to slavery and future admission as slave states, thus implicitly repealing the prohibition on slavery in territory north of 36° 30′ latitude, which had been part of the Missouri Compromise. This change was viewed by Free Soil and abolitionist Northerners as an aggressive, expansionist maneuver by the slave-owning South.“The Act was supported by all Southerners, by Northern ""Doughface"" (pro-Southern) Democrats and by other Northern Democrats persuaded by Douglas' doctrine of ""popular sovereignty"". In the North, the old Whig Party was almost defunct. The opponents were intensely motivated and began forming a new party.”“The new party went well beyond the issue of slavery in the territories. It envisioned modernizing the United States—emphasizing giving free western land to farmers (""free soil"") as opposed to letting slave owners buy up the best lands, expanded banking, more railroads and factories. They vigorously argued that free market labor was superior to slavery and the very foundation of civic virtue and true republicanism—this was the ""Free Soil, Free Labor, Free Men"" ideology.” ~ WikipediaObviously, the sentiments in the nation were reaching a flashpoint, a flashpoint hot enough to set off the Civil War.The money machines we call the 2 political parties are today private""talent agencies"", that vet and approve candidates for corporate and Pentagon compliance, yet they masquerade as public institutions.""Political parties may now and then answer popular ends. However, they are likely, in the course of time, to become potent engines by which cunning, ambitious, and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people, and to usurp for themselves the reigns of government, destroying afterwards the very engines which have lifted them to unjust dominion.""~ George Washington",51,2,62,182,0,14
2,"Historically, the Democrats and Republicans have dominated politics in the US. Do you see a third party being as significant as these two in the near future?",Current Events in U.S. Politics,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Not in the near future. It would take significant changes to America’s political infrastructure to do this, and I doubt we’ll see that any time soon.The two major parties are heavily established in American political culture to the point that most people don’t give much consideration to the other parties at all. Every now and then, a third party makes a bit of noise, but these parties usually don’t last all that long and often fade away. Often the more serious political actors in these parties end up joining the larger parties, and the smaller parties often end up breaking down. This is hardly a uniquely American phenomenon either- loud, vocal minor parties in other countries often have a tendency to make some noise for a while, then deteriorate internally and fade away.The other thing to note is that the US electoral system is very non-conducive to third parties, partly due to the “spoiler” and “tactical voting” effects. The USA operates very heavily on a “winner takes all” type of system- to win a seat or a state in the USA, you need to have a plurality of votes in whatever jurisdiction you are campaigning in. If you win that, you win. If you don’t, you get nothing at all. The result of that is that it tends to encourage voters to vote for major parties, as these parties are often the only ones that have any chance of winning, which disproportionately favouring larger parties.I’ll demonstrate this with a somewhat simplified example. Suppose that in the 2020 presidential race, the breakdown is about 50–50 for left vs right. Most people support the major party on each side, but a small minority prefer the more extreme parties. So for instance, we have about 5% of voters who want to vote for the Constitution Party, about 45% support the Republicans, 45% for the Democrats, and 5% for the Greens.Now you might think that if that was the breakdown of which parties people supported, they’d vote in a roughly similar distribution. That actually usually doesn’t happen! The reason for this is that those voters who support the Constitution and Green parties will usually know that even though they prefer those parties, there’s virtually no chance that those parties will win, so they will usually vote for the major party that more closely lines up with their viewpoint (so a lot of the Green supporters will actually vote democrat). This is sometimes known as “tactical voting”.The other effect of note is the “spoiler” effect, which also often reduces the impact of minor parties. Suppose those 5% of Green supporters actually go and vote Green instead of democrat, but the right-wing voters mostly all vote republican. What you now have is that the Republicans get nearly 50% of the vote, the democrats get 45% and the Greens get about 5%- Republicans win. Basically, it’s very difficult for third parties to get anywhere, which reduces support for them and reinforces major parties. The result is a very strong two-party system.Some countries use different systems to avoid this. For instance, some European countries use Proportional Representation, which basically means the seats in that country’s legislature get distributed according to some formula that aims to more accurately reflect how people voted. So for instance, if 10% of voters in the USA voted Green under such a system, then about 10% of seats in Congress would go to them. These systems have their own advantages and disadvantages.",69,0,96,836,0,0

Some of these are ranked (such as Instant Runoff Voting aka Ranked Choice Voting), others don’t require the voter to rank their choice between preferences (such as Approval Voting). Whichever way is chosen, these at the very least allow you to specify choose your preferred candidate and your “lesser of two evils” candidate without sabotaging your vote for either one.But changing out voting system alone may not be enough, and that’s were changing our single district/single winner system comes into play.

In short, crime should pay for no one. And if someone gets rich by housing criminals, it only makes sense that they would want their hands in the big government pie to make sure we can create more criminals in our society. Private prisons are the WORST side of capitalism.However, if we are talking about removing private companies from the medical field in order to make it a single-payer system, I think there is almost nothing I’d resist more than that.

It should make public common “essential” natural resources and make private the means of getting work done EXCEPT in the case of housing criminals; which is a necessary evil of keeping any government functional.And if our society is honest about its desire to let the cream rise to the top; then we should revisit our laws regarding inheritance, adopting more sane policies that enable the best and brightest of our society to decide how best to apply their fortunes to the good of society when they leave this world [i.e. if they set up their own public trust to finance a pet-project, so be it] but limit substantially their ability to perpetuate wealth with no achievement by putting a flat number on it—-say $1 million dollars to their progeny. If they have 100 kids, let them leave $100 million dollars behind spread out to each of them and see if they achieve the greatness of their forefathers WITH that major head start—-no loopholes; no hidden clauses to circumvent the law of the land—-and this will enable the rest of society to benefit from their clear genius in accumulating massive wealth in ways we might not otherwise expect; while moving toward a more merit-based system of capitalism.

Politics in the US is changing fast … but not really the Democrats, it’s the same factions as past decades.The elites in the party tend to be quite centrist, and the upstarts and edge candidates are actually liberal (think Clinton and Sanders — Clinton could easily have been an Eisenhower-era Republican.)The whole country has moved more to social and wedge issues rather than talking about economic issues, since the late 60s and Civil Rights and other social justice issues, the Vietnam War, and the overall cultural shifts. This hurts the Democrats — they mostly believe that if people would vote their economic interests, the way unions and working people in the 50s would vote for the pro-worker party, they would win more. It’s the Republican-initiated Culture Wars and Southern Strategy that moved us here, with Democrats whining (and losing elections).So; money has hijacked all our politics.

The Democrats say that the people doing the actual work do the actual work, and much wealth comes from a mix of hard work and luck, but once you’re earning maybe ten times what a doctor makes, it’s likely to be more luck or market imbalances or flat out inheritance than you really contributing that much more than the people working for you.

This is new for the GOP.The Democrats, perhaps in response, have ruthlessly excised the guilty from public office. Setting the stage for a moral showdown in races to come.Hypocisy is nothing new in Washington but Trump represents something else. A new era in Republican politics where marital infidelity and perhaps sexual misconduct in general become nonissues.

McCain has taken some unpopular positions but that’s not unusual, he’s always done that. Trump’s on again, off again rivalry with McCain has filtered down into the rank and file.McCain’s healthcare vote has lingered with the members. Few have acknowledged that the plan offered would have been catastrophic for Arizona’s State Operating Budget. In truth I’ve wondered if a few of them are bright enough to even realize the trouble they were trying to introduce.Rhetoric has overridden pragmatism. Paul Ryan is retiring, he cut taxes but exploded deficits, the very thing his entire career has theoretically been built around opposing. Many of his members have utterly failed to provide oversight on the Executive, the only thing they had actually accomplished over the last decade. This is a failure.So part of this silence is shame. McCain has far less visible compromise in his career. He has voted his conscious. He has voted for Arizona. He has spent decades breaking ranks with the party but only when it mattered. His failures were well fought and things he need not justify.This President doesn’t abide maverick operatives in his party. So in the era of Trump we may not see another Principaled legislator with the courage to make the correct, but unpopular vote.There will never be another John McCain. Just like we never had another Henry Clay or Daniel Patrick Moynihan. McCain was Goldwater’s physical heir like Jeff Flake was his intelectual heir. If both are gone the era begun by Goldwater may be over.Its fitting that the Democrats are so much more respectful. There is nothing more deserving of respect than a worthy adversary.

1,Why don't liberals use an organized propaganda like conservatives do with Fox News?,Fox News (cable news network),Propaganda,1!,1!,1!,1!,"I too originally thought this was a troll question. But I think it’s important to answer. It is VERY IMPORTANT that we pay attention to our news sources and attempt to get some sort of measure of fact vs opinion, and not paint everything with the same brush. Some comments here compare PBS/ New York Times, etc. with FOX. I challenge everyone to check Media Bias/Fact Check - Search and Learn the Bias of News Media and see how your favorite news sources score, not just on left vs right but on reliability of factual reporting.Full Disclosure: I am a Progressive. So, just my opinion, but I would say that the Left tend to be more intellectual than the Right (hence the Right accusations of “Latte Liberals” and “Liberal Elites”, even though Corporate Execs, who tend to be “Right” would be the actual financial “elites”. So perhaps they create and read more news sources, as a generalization, than the Right, and so are less susceptible to propaganda. And, I think that many in the media see so many news stories that they may become more tolerant of people and so lean a little to the left. The actual curiosity and interest in people involved in journalism tends to lean to the left, I think. The Left seems more focused on analyzing, while the Right seems more focused on DOING. Combining these two attributes (analyzing and doing) could work well for the country, but right now it seems toxic.But, to go into detail:People often make the mistake of mixing up the entire FOX network with FOX news, but they are not the same. Fox news THEMSELVES do not make the differentiation clear, but some of their shows, like Chris Wallace, are actual reporting, while others are commentary. However, the network as a whole is rated as “RIGHT BIAS” with “Factual reporting: Mixed”. Right biased means: “These media sources are moderately to strongly biased toward conservative causes through story selection and/or political affiliation. They may utilize strong loaded words (wording that attempts to influence an audience by using appeal to emotion or stereotypes), publish misleading reports and omit reporting of information that may damage conservative causes. Some sources in this category may be untrustworthy. Additional Notes: “Fox News Channel, also known as Fox News, is an American basic cable and satellite news television channel that is owned by the Fox Entertainment Group subsidiary of 21st Century Fox. Fox News Channel has been accused of biased reporting and promoting the Republican Party and has been deemed the least accurate cable news source according to Politifact. (7/19/2016)”The PBS News Hour, on the other hand, is listed as “LEFT CENTER BIAS” with “Factual reporting: HIGH”. Left Center Bias means: “These media sources have a slight to moderate liberal bias. They often publish factual information that utilizes loaded words (wording that attempts to influence an audience by using appeal to emotion or stereotypes) to favor liberal causes. These sources are generally trustworthy for information, but may require further investigation.” Additional Notes: “The PBS NewsHour is an American daily evening television news program that is broadcast on the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), airing seven nights a week on more than 300 of the public broadcaster’s member stations. As the nation’s first hour-long nightly news broadcast, the program is known for its in-depth coverage of issues and current events. PBS produces high quality journalism that is sourced and factual. They have a left-center bias in reporting. (5/18/2016)”The New York Times and Washington Post are similar. So people are comparing Apples and Oranges when they compare PBS/ NYT/ WP to FOX. An equivalent “Right-Leaning Bias” source would be the Wall Street Journal.CNN on the other hand, could be considered an equivalent of FOX, in that they are “LEFT BIAS” and “Factual reporting: MIXED”. However, the comments modify this more favorably: “Overall, we rate CNN left biased based on story selection that often favors the left. We rate them Mixed for factual reporting due to misinformation and failed fact checks from guests and pundits. However, CNN’s straight news reporting would earn a High rating for factual reporting. (5/16/2016) Updated (4/27/2018)”MSNBC is in a similar boat to CNN, however “Update 7/29/2017: MSNBC has been hiring numerous conservative journalists, reporters and writers over the last year. MSNBC will be re-evaluated to determine if they have indeed moved more toward the right in reporting.”There is a “LEAST BIASED” category at Mediabiasfactcheck, which includes: Amnesty International, Big Think, Christian Science Monitor, Consumer Reports, Cook Political Report, C-SPAN, Factcheck.org, Harvard Business Review, Kaiser Family Foundation, PEW Research, Politifact. Reuters, The Economist, USA Today, Wikipedia, to name a few. Always double-check your sources, however.",86,1,25,278,0,4

Then I read some answers from people who agree that there is no equivalent mouthpiece for the Left, and seriously proffered reasons.If you take this question seriously, I believe I know why. It is because nearly every other mainstream source of programming is a mouthpiece for the Left, such that those who hear only this echo chamber do not realize much of it is left-wing propaganda. Once upon a time we had a clear division between news and opinion, but nowadays opinion often comes dressed as fact.The cure is to incorporate the point of view of some right-wing news sources. From the standpoint of straight news (and some of that still remains on both sides), there are differences between left and right leaning outlets, if only in what stories they decide to cover. By hearing from both sides, a truer picture will emerge.It’s also a good idea to expose oneself to some right leaning programming. Compare that to what the left leaning outlets are saying. The truth is usually somewhere in the middle, but at least a well-informed consumer has the relative context to understand the issues.If everyone would do this and make it a part of how they consume news and current events, it would be harder to be angered by one side or the other, harder to demonize those who don’t think like you, and they would be a more informed and contributing part of the process of being a good citizen.

That became even more likely when Trump started talking about his victory as some sort of landslide of historic proportions — an upset does not a landslide make.And Trump and his supporters care about the popular vote too — it’s no coincidence that the number of “fraudulent” votes they discovered in the ether was just enough to put him over the top.Of course, those who support some sort of electoral college reform will also continue to highlight any election where the winner came in in 2nd place in the popular vote.",1.1k,20,28,86,0,0
4,Why did Hillary Clinton supporters focus on winning the popular vote when only winning the Electoral College matters?,Electoral Systems,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"In any election, it is a foregone conclusion that the person who gets the largest number of votes is the person who should hold office. And most of the time, that is what happens.In this case, the electoral college was set up to prevent the election from being decided by the electorate. The folks in the electoral college can see clearly when a mistake has been made, and they can vote for the better person, and can block an unsuited person from being elected. That’s what they are supposed to do.However, over the years, the electors have increasingly been required to abide by newer standards, completely defeating the purpose of the College. This was very clearly demonstrated when the electoral votes hypothetically went to one person who is demonstrated to be utterly unfit to hold pretty much any public office, let alone the Presidency of the United States. The entire purpose of the Electoral College is to stop an unfit person from being elected. This was precisely the situation with Mr. Trump, but as we know, nobody in the Electoral College was willing to do the obviously right thing.Since the College did not do what it was supposed to when confronted with a person transparently unfit to hold public office, it is useless. We need to eliminate the Electoral College and make the election subject to popular vote, period.They way you phrase your question, I get the impression that you are not unhappy with the present person in the office of the President.

(When you can tell a citizen of California that the value of his vote is substantially less than the value of the vote of a person from, say, Montana, you know that if you try to explain that, you will not be able to avoid insulting the person whose only crime was to vote in a state which has a large population.

2,Will Democrats get a majority in the Senate in the 2018 mid-term elections?,U.S. Senate,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"There is a relatively small chance of this happening.Right now, it’s 51–49, so Democrats need to win a net of two seats to make it 51–49 the other way. A 50–50 tie means Mike Pence would break the ties, because one of the few actual jobs the Vice President has is to break ties.Senate terms are six years, so the seats up for reëlection in 2018 are those that were up in 2012 and 2006. Both of these years were very strong for Democrats. There are 100 Senate seats, so 33 (or 34) of them are up each time, plus any seats where someone retired or died and they need to have an election, even if there is a temporary replacement.In 2018, the Republicans have 9 Senators up for reëlection, while the Democrats have 26.There are two seats the Republicans have which they could definitely lose: Arizona and Nevada. There’s talk of Tennessee not being totally safe. Some people say Ted Cruz could be beaten in Texas, but I imagine Cruz pulls out a victory.So from the above, it would seem like the Republicans could lose two or three seats, so the Democrats have a pretty basic road to majority control. Except…The Democrats have 26 seats up, and some of these could likely flip to the Republicans. These include:Joe Manchin, West Virginia. Trump’s best performance in 2016 was in West Virginia. While Manchin often bucks his party and votes with the Republicans, the Trump brand is pretty strong in West Virginia. There were primaries in West Virginia on Tuesday, and it looked like the Republicans were on track to nominate a candidate with very serious flaws (he had been a coal mine CEO, and had ignored safety precautions which resulted in workers dying and him going to prison). However, this candidate came in third place, and the Republicans have a good shot at winning West Virginia.Joe Donnelly of Indiana. Pence’s home state. Hillary didn’t even get 40% of the vote here. In 2012, Donnelly got 50.0% of the vote, while the Republican got 44% and a Libertarian picking up the rest. The Republican had beaten popular Senator Lugar in the primary, and then went on to make a bad gaffe, saying pregnancy from rape was “something that God intended.” The Republicans should have a better candidate this time.Claire McCaskill, Missouri. In 2012, the Republicans chose Todd Akin (who was an alumnus of my college, but many years earlier), who made a ridiculous statement about “legitimate rape” in regards to abortion, a gaffe that was a guarantee to lose the race. Republicans should nominate someone better this time, and Missouri is a pretty red state.Jon Tester, Montana. Another Democrat in a deep red state. Remember, in these states, Trump is well liked.Heidi Heitkamp, North Dakota. She’s also bucked her party leadership a few times, but North Dakota is a deep red state.Bill Nelson, Florida. He’s being challenged by Rick Scott, the governor of Florida. Scott has won state wide races, as has Nelson.Republicans won’t win all of the above, but it’s more than likely they win one or two at least. So if Democrats have two pickups (NV + AZ) and the Republicans have two pickups from the above, it’ll be status quo in the Senate.Democrats have to run the table and win these races in red states, and pick up both Nevada and Arizona.",115,1,203,"1,149",0,0
2,Will Democrats get a majority in the Senate in the 2018 mid-term elections?,U.S. Senate,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"Yes, if they gain 2 seats without losing any of the 26(!) they are defending, which includes 2 Independents who caucus with them. The large number (26/49) is due to the wave elections of 2006, in which control of the Senate (as well as the House) shifted from Republicans to Democrats and 2012, when these seats were up for re-election which coincided with the successful re-election campaign of President Barack Obama. Additionally, a special election is being held in Minnesota alongside the regularly scheduled Senate election to complete the term of Democratic Senator Al Franken, who resigned prior to the end of his second term, due in 2020.The best pickup opportunities for Democrats are in Nevada, which is the only one of the 9 Republican-held seats on the ballot that is in a state won by Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Arizona, which is an open seat in a state President Donald Trump won by less than 4 points. However, as earlier stated, they must hold all of their current seats, which is a tough task. 10 of the 26 - Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Florida, Ohio, North Dakota, Indiana, Missouri, Montana and West Virginia - are in states won by Trump, and the latter 5 were won by double-digit margins. A bad night for Democrats would result in the loss of one or more of these 5, but they could still win control of the Senate by winning Republican-held seats other than Nevada and Arizona.In Tennessee, which also is an open seat, the Democratic nominee is Phil Bredesen, a two-term former Governor and former Mayor of Nashville who won a landslide (40 points) re-election in 2006 while carrying all 95 counties, the first statewide official to do so since then-Senator Al Gore, Jr.’s re-election in 1990. Incidentally, Gore is the last Democrat elected to the Senate from Tennessee, which has not elected any other Democratic Senator since 1994. The state has become significantly redder in the 24 years since then, but if any Democrat can put this into play, it's Bredesen.Mississippi plays host to a special election to complete the unexpired term of Senator Thad Cochran, who resigned on account of ill health. This takes the form of a primary, to be held alongside the regularly scheduled Senate election, in which no party is identified on the ballot and the top-two vote getters advance to a runoff if no one receives 50% +1 of the vote on the first ballot. The likely Democratic nominee is former U.S Agriculture Secretary and Congressman Mike Espy, who starts off as an underdog against appointed Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith, who has already won a statewide election to office as Mississippi’s Agriculture Commissioner. However, the presence of a fellow Republican - State Senator Chris McDaniel, who narrowly defeated Cochran with a plurality in the 2014 primary, but narrowly lost the subsequent runoff - may complicate Hyde-Smith’s path towards making the runoff, creating an opportunity for Espy - the only Democrat on the officially non-partisan primary ballot.Finally, there is Texas, which Clinton lost by a much closer margin - 9 points - than Tennessee and Mississippi. However, no Democrat has been elected to the Senate since 1988, when Senator Lloyd Bentsen was winning re-election while simultaneously losing the Presidential election as Vice-presidential nominee, including in Texas. Democratic Congressman Beto O’Rourke of El Paso is facing off against Senator Ted Cruz, famous for his role in the 2013 government shutdown and as runner-up to Trump in the 2016 Presidential primaries. Cruz is not a particularly popular incumbent - on either side of the divide - but Texas has not elected any Democrat to statewide office since 1994, making this a much harder lift than Tennessee, which has twice elected Bredesen since then, and Mississippi, whose last Democrat elected statewide - Attorney General Jim Hood - has served continously since 2003.",442,2,18,23,0,0

Many fly in on legitimate visas, then simply stay after the visa has expired.It’s worth noting that there’s already a border fence in place. It hasn’t stopped immigrants from entering the US.The wall is not a one-time-only expenditure. In addition to having to cough up funds for maintenance, it also needs to be manned at checkpoints, and patrols kept up to look for damage or possible covert entry. Put bluntly: the wall won’t reduce the current funds expended on border control.Drug smuggling continues unabated, and the Cartels have dug tunnels beneath the border fence for decades - do you really imagine that they’ll be put off by a wall?And, yes, again, let’s reiterate: Mexico will not be paying for the wall, contrary to what Trump promised during his campaign. The taxpayers will do that, and even stopping aid to Mexico would take the better part of a century to obtain the 20-billion dollars required to build the monstrosity. That’s before maintenance and repair costs, by the by.Realistically, the reason for much of the illegal immigration between the US and Mexico is because the Mexican economy is worse than the US one, and therefore immigrants needing employment and higher living standards are willing to chance the border in order to obtain that. Improving economic standards in Mexico would reduce this, and make it far less likely that Mexicans would want to come to the United States.A wall simply won’t alter that - again, most of those entering the US and staying illegally will enter legally at first.",1.2k,31,1.4k,"1,931",0,0

We have done a myriad of things over the years including radio free Europe broadcasts into Russia and even paying for American campaign managers and consultants and advertising to help Yeltsin win in 1996, we even sent secretary of state Hillary Clinton to Russia several years ago on the eve of the previous Russian election to talk about how bad Putin was and how good the opposition was. US Politicians have even been accused of asking for Russian help to unseat the opposition, when the USSR fell in the early 90's and then KGB and diplomatic archives were open to foreigners and researchers for a few years, the soviets had diplomatic cables from their ambassador in Washington about secret conversations between Ted Kennedy and the Soviet Ambassador asking for help to unseat Reagan in the 1984 election (the Russians say they refused).

7,What is the real reason that Democrats want draconian gun control and Republicans do not?,Gun Control Debate,Democratic Party vs. Republican Party,1!,1!,1!,1!,"I’m a former Republican, but I didn’t leave the GOP over its current gun fetish, nor does the Democratic Party’s stance on gun legislation scare me, and I still have my pro-RKBA beliefs.Gun ownership (or sharing a house with a gun owner) has been falling steadily for Democrats and currently stands at about 25%, while it’s been holding steadier for Republicans at close to 60%. That means the ratio is much closer to 2:1 than what many “They want our guns!” people might believe. As others have pointed out, Americans support — by large margins — many common sense laws.The current belief that Democrats just want to take all the guns started about 25 years ago. Ironically, Ronald Reagan came out in support of “sensible gun laws”, and he had enacted a variety of reasonable gun control laws both as Governor of California and President.What changed was the NRA’s opposition to any and all attempts at sensible, rational, and common sense gun legislation. Many NRA members, myself and former President George H. W. Bush included, quit the NRA over the behavior of president Wayne LaPierre. The result is that any laws that are proposed are grossly twisted out of proportion.In short, “What is the real reason that Democrats want draconian gun control and republicans do not?” is a figment of NRA fanboys overactive imagination.",11.1k,571,251,225,0,0
7,What is the real reason that Democrats want draconian gun control and Republicans do not?,Gun Control Debate,Democratic Party vs. Republican Party,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Before outlining the reason Democrats (at least, progressive liberal/leftist Democrats, which is the vast majority of them) support Draconian gun control, let’s first establish that, contrary to their pathetic and transparently insincere denials in this thread and elsewhere, Democrats do, in fact, not only support, but enthusiastically demand truly Draconian gun control policies. Their assertions to the contrary are based entirely on empty claims that the gun control policies they demand, aren’t really Draconian, they’re “reasonable”, and “common sense” - and that anyone who dares oppose those controls, is “extreme”, and/or an “NRA gun nut” or “gun manufacturer” who “wants no controls at all”. It’s much like the virtually universal progressive liberal/leftist Democrat conviction f that slaughtering a perfectly healthy, fully-developed human being, up to and including (and in some cases, even after) the moment it emerges from the womb, is simply “women’s health care”, and that anyone (including women) who makes the observation that there’s another human being in the equation, is a “violent troglodyte who wants to strap women down to tables and force them to bear children of rape and incest”.Let’s begin with the fact that at least 85% of Democrats support bans on almost 90% of all currently-owned firearms in the US. This is because 85% is the percentage of Democrats who advocate bans on “assault weapons”, whose definition they’ve made so insanely broad, that it covers virtually all semi-automatic rifles, shotguns and handguns, which comprise about 90% of all firearms in the US. It’s important to note that these people know they want to ban the latter; the “assault weapons” euphemism is merely another distraction, used to again demonize as “extreme” anyone who might oppose or challenge their position). For those who might doubt this, take a look at HR-5087, the Democrat’s latest and greatest “Assault Weapons” ban, which is currently supported by all but a handful of US House Democrats (to confirm this, simply read the list of Democrats on the first page who formally endorsed the bill).Predictably, Democrats assert that banning “assault weapons” isn’t really “draconian”, but simply “common sense” and “reasonable” = often citing unnamed “polls” which they claim supports their position. However, when one examines the bill’s definitions of what constitutes an “assault weapon”, and the firearms logically covered by those definitions, it’s obvious that, in fact, the ban applies to virtually all semi-automatic firearms - rifles, shotguns and handguns. Only a (progressive liberal/leftist) Democrat would assert that this isn’t Draconian, but of course, if you ask them why they don’t consider such a widespread ban “Draconian”, they’ll again parrot undefined and circular emotional euphemisms such as “military grade” and “weapons of war” and “only good for killing people as quickly as possible”, along with the tired, circular and equally meaningless “reasonable”, and “common sense” accolades.Next on the list is their beloved “Universal Background Check” (UBC), which is in fact a euphemism for banning all private firearm transfers. Anyone who’s thought about this issue for more than a nanosecond or two realizes that the UBC, like all other Democrat-supported gun control proposals, would have absolutely no effect on criminals, who don’t get their firearms through lawful channels in the first place, and would never submit to a background check which they knew they could not pass. Virtually the only people who voluntarily submit to background checks under the existing National Instant Check System (NICS) are law-abiding citizens who know they can/will pass such a check. Further, Democrats ignore the fact that the UBC is in fact literally unenforceable without a national gun registry, which is currently prohibited by federal law (to say nothing of the 2nd Amendment). This quickly reveals the reason that Democrats support the UBC so passionately, which is that it begs the creation of a national gun registry, which is a necessary prerequisite to widespread confiscation of privately-owned firearms. And of course, since over 2/3 of Democrats enthusiastically classify as “reasonable” and “common sense” what they refer to as “Australian Style” gun control, which is based on exactly the former sort of widespread confiscation, the question isn’t whether Democrats support Draconian gun control policy - which has now been shown to be inarguable - it’s how they believe they can insist otherwise, while maintaining some semblance of a straight face.On top of all this, over 50% of Democrats (and that’s just the ones who admitted being enthusiastic about it) support repealing the 2nd Amendment entirely. And once again, they’ll insist this isn’t “draconian”, claiming that the 2nd Amendment is really only about “regulating the National Guard”, and that it never applied to the “people” in the first place (the USSC Heller and McDonald decisions notwithstanding) - and predictably accompanied by the classic Democrat canard of classifying their position as “mainstream”, by labeling as “extreme” anyone who dares to hold a different perspective.Thus the issue isn’t whether the Democrats support Draconian gun control policies - it’s that Democrats want people to believe that bans of 90% of lawfully-owned firearms, followed by widespread confiscation of those firearms which aren’t turned in voluntarily, isn’t really “Draconian” at all - it’s merely a “common sense” and “reasonable” effort to “save lives”. Which of course is why Democrats invariably drape their calls for Draconian gun controls under the banner of “gun safety” (never mind the fact that the policies they embrace most passionately, have the longest and most sordid history of producing the exact opposite results in terms of crime rates and public safety.Democrats virtually unanimously support what they refer to as “Gun-Free Zones”, which is a euphemism for guaranteeing deranged lunatics intent on slaughtering as many people as possible, a large population of powerless victims who have been legally prohibited from defending themselves with a firearm - the single most useful and effective self-defense implement in existence. And when endless data shows that mass killings invariably take place in these “gun free” zones, Democrats predictably call for (you guessed it !!) widespread confiscation of lawfully-owned firearms from responsible, law-abiding citizens, coupled with even more restrictive prohibitions on self-defense – a classic example of the famous “reasonable” and “common sense” controls virtually unanimously supported by Democrats.So, to return to the original question, as to why Democrats support Draconian gun control policies, the reason is that Democrats ultimately and invariably trust government control over individual liberty and property rights, and the myths of entitlement, identity politics and social justice over the tenets of personal responsibility and accountability and individual autonomy. Their ultimate goal is a massive, police/welfare state over which they can permanently exert total and unfettered control over an unarmed and dependent populace, and the latter’s property and important life choices. Having an armed populace that has the will and the means to resist and potentially cast off that control (the original historical basis for the 2nd Amendment), is a clear and present threat to the very existence of that police/welfare state/plantation. This is why cities with high crime rates, extensive violent crime, extensive drug abuse, high unemployment and widespread dependence on the welfare state structure, extensive illiteracy and illegitimacy rates, you will invariably see (a) strict gun control laws, and (b) a long and corrupt history of total and uninterrupted Democrat control.",413,33,50,370,0,1

If five years for a clerical error over owning something that is ""scary"" isn't considered draconian, I'm not confident an attempt at a rational discussion is worthwhile.And, of course…while ""no one is coming for your guns""…guess what happens if you make the tiniest slip and violate one of the 30,000 gun laws? You'll be arrested, and they'll certainly take your guns.Then there is the warning issued by the commonwealth of Massachusetts threatening a life sentence (LIFE?!) for being caught with a bump stock.But, back to the question:The real reason is because of ""sports team"" politics. Neither side puts any more thought into it than someone choosing between the Steelers or the Eagles. That's why Democrats can spend thirty years fighting to end the War on Drugs and release dealers from prison, yet claim with a straight face that guns should be banned to protect the community. It'd why Republicans can fight abortion as if it were domestic genocide, yet callously shrug off disease and hunger affecting children who are already born.Neither gives a crap about doing anything positive. They just care about ""winning"" the next election, as if elections had ""winners"" instead of ""applicants hired by the people"". They treat politics like a game show. They don't care who gets hurt in their legislative warfare crossfire, just so long as their ""team"" is in the lead.Republicans want gun control, but Democrats want a little more. The nature of the twisted two-party system means each side eventually continues to escalate, until one is proposing mandatory firearms ownership and lifetime militia service, while the other side bans all guns, knives, metal flatware, and anything else the nanny state thinks you shouldn't have. The escalation of rhetoric between the two can only be stopped by occasional crushing defeats and reversing control, and allowing the other side to hold power long enough to make the previous incumbents snap back into reality.Unfortunately, third parties are no help. The Greens repeat the Democratic platform louder; the Libertarians are Republicans who are embarrassed about it. Ballot access is a major handicap to them, anyway.Democrats don't want gun control; they just want to harass/annoy/defeat any demographic that votes Republican, like gun owners.Republicans don't care about gun rights; they just know they can't win metropolitan areas.Take a closer look at the background of incoming NRA President Oliver North's past views on assault rifles after the Branch Davidian disaster at Waco TX, or the reason outgoing President Pete Brownell is resigning in frustration.",386,13,58,540,0,0
7,What is the real reason that Democrats want draconian gun control and Republicans do not?,Gun Control Debate,Democratic Party vs. Republican Party,1!,1!,1!,1!,"What is the real reason that Democrats want draconian gun control and Republicans do not?First, the question, as asked, is insincere; the Democrats have not proposed nor advocated anything that any reasonable person would call “draconian gun control.” Here is a link to what the Democrats have actually proposed:Democrats Turn Trump’s Gun Control Rambling Into a ProposalSo, before we can approach an answer, let’s recast the question as:What is the real reason that Democrats want some form of gun control legislation and Republicans do not?Now that we have a question devoid of sensationalist and inaccurate rhetoric, it will be easier to provide a meaningful answer. There are many reasons that Democrats want gun control legislation; 136 of them in fact just since the beginning of this year: Mass Shooting Tracker. Mass shootings, while not a uniquely American problem, are much more of a problem in the U.S. than in other industrialized nations. U.S. has the most public mass shooters in the world, study shows. Democrats believe that legislation which protects the 2nd amendment rights of law-abiding citizens while making it harder for criminals or the mentally unstable to commit mass murder would be good for all of us.Republicans, whether or not they believe that legislation limiting access to guns would help save lives, are opposed to the Democrats legislative proposals for two reasons:It was proposed by Democrats. For years now, Republicans in congress have opposed anything and everything that Democrats introduce. It is not because they don’t believe in the legislation, some of the things Democrats have proposed were actually first developed by Republican allied groups, but it is because for far too many Republicans, politics has become tribal. Whatever the other tribe wants, we will oppose and whatever we want we will try to get without ever enlisting help from the other side.The NRA. The National Rifle Association works on behalf of the gun and ammunition makers in the U.S. and they spend a lot, a whole lot, on congressional campaigns and lobbying efforts. In other words, the NRA owns a very large number of congressional Republicans. The NRA doesn’t want any kind of gun legislation because it is bad for business. Any Republican that so much as winks toward legislation that might make it somewhat more difficult to buy firearms will not only loose their NRA backing; they will also face a challenger backed by the NRA next time they’re up for reelection. Why the NRA is so powerful on Capitol Hill, by the numbersSo, Democrats would like to make it a bit more difficult for some people to obtain weapons because they believe doing so would reduce the number of homicides in the U.S.; particularly homicides related to mass shooting incidents. Republicans are opposed to such legislation because it is being proposed by their tribal enemies and it is opposed by the NRA, to whom they are beholden.",282,11,379,847,0,4
7,What is the real reason that Democrats want draconian gun control and Republicans do not?,Gun Control Debate,Democratic Party vs. Republican Party,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Here’s what I’ve noticed about the “commonsense” gun control laws that the Democrats (or more accurately, liberals) like to propose: they’re anything but commonsense. They’re commonsense only if one doesn’t understand the first thing about firearms, or is willing to ignore any number of inconvenient truths to keep the ol’ echo chamber intact.First example, the assault weapons ban. It is anything but “commonsense” for several reasons: Heller vs DC affirmed a right to privately own firearms that at least (in the words of the majority justices) applied to the most common firearm of the era. Today, that would be the autoloader pistol. These weapons are not any less deadly than an AR-style rifle. They are semi-automatic. They typically hold ten or more rounds in an internal magazine. They can be outfitted with a variety of attachments. And Seung-Hui Cho used them to kill 32 people and wound 17 others at Virginia Tech. He didn’t use an assault rifle - he used the most common firearm of the day.A week ago, one city over from where I live in Santa Fe, Texas, there was a school shooting. Ten dead, thirteen injured, and the shooter used firearms that were designed almost 150 years ago. But the liberals are fixated on banning assault rifles…Second example: beating the dead “militia” and “well-regulated” horses. They seem singularly unable to accept that Heller vs DC is a thing, it really happened, and their opinions on the definition, interpretation, or intent of the Second Amendment does not matter (nor does mine). For the foreseeable future, individual Americans can own firearms. Deal with it.Third example: a belief that legislation will make 300 million of anything just go away…especially a popular commodity that people can and will turn to getting from the black market if worst comes to worst. Fun fact: the compliance rate of the SAFE Act is less than twenty percent.Fourth example: liberals insist that the Founding Fathers would not have included the Second if they could foresee how deadly modern firearms are. Never mind the fact that no part of the Bill of Rights has ever been interpreted or applied differently based on technological change. NEVER. The First applies to hand-printed broadsheets and this post in a media that did not exist when I was born. The government cannot search a modern hi-rise condo without a warrant any more than they could search a log cabin two hundred years ago. You get the idea: there’s a precedent that was set long ago and repeatedly. The Second should not be an exception. There shouldn’t be any exceptions.Finally, the belief that it’s okay to hold millions of otherwise law-abiding, peaceful people responsible for what a few have done. We don’t make all drivers take a breathalyzer to start their cars because a few drivers have hurt or killed people in DWIs. We don’t fine all doctors when one doctor is convicted of malpractice. We don’t punish people for what they *might* do…but apparently gun owners are an exception.Why pass laws that won’t save any lives, are fundamentally unjust, and based on willful ignorance? The feels, man. Nothing more.",125,8,89,545,0,0
7,What is the real reason that Democrats want draconian gun control and Republicans do not?,Gun Control Debate,Democratic Party vs. Republican Party,1!,1!,1!,1!,"This question is not really a question but rather an extreme statement: that Democrats (and the vast majority of Americans, according to several recent polls by Fox and Quinnipiac) want “draconian” gun laws.Let’s examine this rhetoric: Draco was a Greek leader who established severe written laws that were applied equally to all; for instance, the penalty for stealing an apple was death. That is what draconian means.What are the basic reforms that Democrats want?Universal background check to keep violent criminals from obtain guns in private sales without any id, records, background checks, or monitoring. Such a law in no way infringes on the rights of law-abiding gun owners and that is why Quinnipiac found 97% of gun owners support such a law and pro-gun Fox polling found 90% support. Four polls show that even NRA members support UBC by 74% (as the NRA opposes). There is nothing draconian about this law, which in most formats, would provide penalties (moderate jail time) for violating it by selling guns to violent individuals or buying them under a straw buyer or false id.Ban on new semi-automatic assault weapons (the terms used by the expired 1994 Ban), while leaving existing as legal but registered. The 1994 Ban and current state bans do not ban existing weapons or confiscate but ban NEW weapons and require registration. The Quinnipiac (an A rated polling firm, based on historical accuracy) found that 2/3 of Americans support an overall ban on such assault weapons, but the proposed laws wound not confiscate or make illegal existing weapons.Time delays, a few days in most cases, which mitigates against hot-headed and impulsive purchases to settle a score. Waiting a few days to obtain your weapon does not infringe on your right to own one.The penalties for buying or selling weapons where prohibited would be moderate; the penalty for not registering an existing assault weaponHere is the existing Connecticut law on registering pre-existing banned weapons: ““If you fail to register a banned assault weapon and you can prove that you legally owned it before the ban took effect, the maximum penalty is a misdemeanor, not a felony,”There is no draconian death penalty, even for illegally selling a weapon to a terrorist or violent criminal. Misdemeanors are not enforced with draconian punishmentsI hope I have explained what the actual gun law reforms most Democrats and the vast majority of Americans support and shown how inflammatory and hysterical it is to call such laws draconian.One last thing: why do Republicans not want even moderate common sense gun regulations that the vast majority support? In 2016, the NRA, which represents the gun makers (who largely fund it) gave 30 million to Trump and another 30 million to Republicans……legalized bribes are the norm. In fairness, a handful of conservative Democrats who vote with Republicans on guns (ie keep bills holed up in committee so they never actually come to a vote) also receive funding.",368,27,187,560,0,0
7,What is the real reason that Democrats want draconian gun control and Republicans do not?,Gun Control Debate,Democratic Party vs. Republican Party,1!,1!,1!,1!,"If there is a non-verbal reason for the Democrats to want “draconian” gun laws, I wouldn’t know, as I am neither a Democrat or afraid of guns being in the hands of citizens.I don’t think Democrats generally want draconian gun laws at all, though…little they’ve said as a group has been “draconian”. But if you take a difference between the Citizenry and the Officials of the Democratic party, I think it’s quite obvious that the democratic followers are simply frightened people that know very little about guns, mental health, bureaucracy, computer science, etc. There are already numerous laws, many of which are useless due to the fact that the bureaucracy can’t get their crap together and build a cross-department system to even effect effective background checks (whether a single computer database or just a system of handshakes/requests/responses to easily ascertain background info from the numerous sources which might have relevant info)So many democrats want a longer hold period…. for what?? Holding something out of reach longer doesn’t make a background check any more accurate if the background check itself is incomplete. I’d have to look at the numbers, but I don’t see where the kids from Columbine or Sandy Hook or any of those places would still be alive because the shooters had a week longer to think about what they were doing. Hell, the planning of each shooting probably took longer than the background checks. I’m not seeing the connection in the democrat solution. I think it is based on a very incomplete understanding of Systems engineering.As far as motives, Democrats are angry, frightened people that have a very romanticised version of humanity where all poor people are downtrodden, and all violent people aren’t really violent and wicked people just need a hug. Their rhetoric about gun control is 100% reactionary, with no real solutions or understanding of the root of the problem being displayed. Banning bump stocks is a useless bandaid, as the concept of it is ridiculously simple and buildable on a 3d printer from specs publicly available on the Internet. Bandaids are not solutions. More effective solutions would be removing guns entirely and puting to death anybody dealing in them (like Singapore with drugs) or tweaking the overall environment such that people no longer want to ravage a bunch of innocent people (which has nothing at all to do with gun control)As for the OFFICIALS pulling all the Democrat strings - Nazi’s removed guns before taking over the land, I think I recall Russia doing the same. Could you imagine Kim Jong Un arming his own people outside of the military structure? If there was an ulterior motive there, it would be to make the country more docile. But I don’t think there is…our system is too big and diverse for such things. I think Democratic officials are just democrats who need something to spearhead in order to be relevant. Inciting mobs based on hearsay and half truths is certainly a way to be relevant when your party is a mob of overly excitable people.AS FOR REPUBLICANS, I can speak far more directly about that: There is no conspiracy. Everything you hear on TV or read in articles about what the NRA wants and what the Founding fathers espoused and that the survivalists long for is exactly what they think. Republicans in general don’t generally have ulterior motives. They think too much with their heads (in all of their minds’ flawed glory, and lack of certain compassions or understanding of the root causes of certain problems). They have biases like anyone else, they’re not perfect, they are xenophobic just like the rest of the world, and their understanding of the ways of the world is incomplete, but their hearts are only in a few places: 1. Don’t screw with me and I won’t screw with you. 2. Don’t keep me from raising my kids in the way I want to, and I won’t stop you from raising yours. 3. Remember your history, because it is violent, greedy, undemocratic, bloody, oppressive, etc. A well armed citizenry can stop even the thought of a lot of bad things, as deduced by the opposing fact that taking away guns is a demonstrable first step to takeover of a people. 4. Hunting is really fun, and in many of the non-urban communities it is a badge of honor, a rite of passage, and a way to maintain good stewardship over the environment, which the city folks are wrecking every day with their suburban development and industrial/commercial wastes. 5. They hold their religious ideals pretty close to their chest. They’re afraid of a lot of things unfortunately that make them forget their true libertarian nature when it comes to homosexuality, for example.There is only one motive of Republican OFFICIALS that I can tell - They’re also afraid of their government. Especially in this environment where the bleeding hearts are crucifying people left and right, the executive branch is becoming a tool of the elite to secretly go after conservatives and libertarians and bypass the normal congressional process (as we all know, it is broken and divided and unable to effectively stop a lot of things that a President can currently get away with). They want to be able to defend their homes, the men want/need to be the last line of defense between their wives and daughters and mothers getting raped. They want to work hard for what they have and have a way to defend that investment of their time when somebody comes to try and take it. Texans in particular want Texas to be where Texans call home (as opposed to just THE U.S.). Because of all the other things I said about their history, they watch a lot of historical shows, read a lot of history books and they’re damned afraid of what they’ve seen. They don’t want the American government to be hijacked by an oligarchical elite and have innocent citizens start to be punished for their beliefs by a liberal government. We’ve already seen some of that actually happen with the numerous Obama scandals with the IRS and what not. That scares the crap out of republicans - and guns are part of a solution to hedge against it. Texas essentially has a standing army that the federal government would have to go up against…you think those young boys/girls in the military are going to want to fire on their own people - their own neighbors? We saw that in Oregon a couple years back, clearly the answer was NO THEY DO NOT.So there you go… Not a greatly organized thesis. But generally there is no ulterior motive. What people are saying on TV is actually what they feel and think, for pretty obvious reasons once you understand the mind that makes a republican or a democrat. It’s that simple.Democrat = fear of others humans with guns, thinks the world should be safe and everybody wrapped in bubble wrap so they invest in bubble wrapRepublicans = fear of other humans guns, thinks there’s not enough bubble wrap in the world, invests in weapons for self defense.",287,10,39,203,0,0

4,"Why did the Whig Party die out, and why won't Republicans and Democrats do the same?",Democratic Party vs. Republican Party,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"The Whig Party died out because its primary consensus was being the anti-Democratic Party with a nominally conservative platform. When it came to the major issues of the day, particularly slavery, there was no consensus. On top of that, there was no substantial national leadership. They elected two military generals to the presidency, both of whom died in office and were replaced by not so faithful party members. (While not a Democrat, Tyler sided with them more than with his fellow Whigs; Fillmore went on to join the Know-Nothings.) Their primary leadership were sectionally divergent with Henry Clay representing the West, Daniel Webster the North, and sometimes ally (Democrat) John C. Calhoun the South. This lack of consensus and leadership, led to a splintering of the party. Some upheld slavery. Others wanted immediate abolition. Some favored protective tariffs, others did not. Many were staunch nationalists, other remained sectionalist.The weakening of the Democratic Party at this time (ironically) didn’t help them either. With a weakening opposition, the Whigs began to lose the little consensus (being anti-Dem) they had. By the 1850s, the Whigs were merely one of several anti-Democratic parties, except they had no solid agenda. The Know-Nothings absorbed a major portion of their electorate. The new Republican Party absorbed their abolitionist bloc. The remaining Whigs either joined them or the Democratic Party or joined the Whigs’ rump Constitutional Union Party based in the South. Unable to rival an increasingly fractured, but still viable Democratic Party or the nascent Republican Party, the Constitutional Unionists, along with an increasingly irrelevent Know-Nothing Party eventually allied themselves with their political cousins, the Republicans to oppose the Democrats whom they saw as supporting secession, slavery, and immigrants.After the Civil War, this coalition held as all these factions had become one and the same with the Republican Party. Since the Democratic Party was severely weakened, the Republicans essentially held on to national dominance, with few major interruptions, until the Great Depression. During this time, Democrats were attacked as the party of “Rum, Romanism, and Rebellion” [Republicans increasing supported alcohol prohibition, anti-Catholicism, and continued to accused Democrats of instigating the Civil War with Republican candidates “waving the bloody shirt” during elections].Despite this Democratic weakening, left-leaning liberal Republicans grew disenchanted with their party, causing a gradual exodus to the Democratic Party early on and even through the Progressive Era. While it’s not likely this saved the Democratic Party outside of the South, it’s not easily dismissed as being an overall benefit for Dems, especially since many Dems were growing increasing left-wing and Populist in the North and West. The new focus on economic and political reform issues at the height of the Gilded Age, also helped keep Democrats viable. The Progressive Era and the following New Deal Era would solidify the lines in the economic debate with Democrats adopting the progressive line and Republicans adopting the conservative line.This ideological polarization likely kept both parties viable in a way the Whigs never could achieve and has allowed Democrats to maintain a consistency with their Jeffersonian origins and allowed Republicans, born in the fires of fracture and civil war, to maintain a stream of consensus in a way that the Whigs, which lacked the leadership pedigree of liberal political giants such as Jefferson, Jackson, or FDR of the Democratic Party and the pro-business conservative ideological coherence of their successor, the Republican Party.If either party loses these characteristics, particularly in terms of leadership and consensus, it would be likely that they will “go the way of the Whigs,” but that’s unlikely to happen anytime soon. The two-party system is extremely resilient and with their increasing political polarization, the two parties are likely to become more enduring going forward, especially as the voters seek “a national champion” to be president and increased ideological coherence within their parties of choice. For better or worse, it’s best to assume that our politics will hold onto the Democratic and Republican labels for the next few decades, likely the rest of the century.",40,0,10,238,0,0

Charged with lying to the FBI.Michael Flynn - Pled guilty in perjury trap - there is speculation the judge may throw the case out as he did not actually lie.Rick Gates - 1 perjury charge/1 conspiracy charge. He pleaded both out to avoid having to pay the enormous legal fees.Paul Manafort - an insane amount of charges dating back 20 years. He is fighting all of them including Mueller’s ability to go back 20 years and charge him with things unrelated to the Russia investigation. This one is interesting because the judge may side with him.Richard Pinedo- charged with identity theft.Alex can Zwaan- charged with lyng to the FBI about knowing Gates13 Russian nationals and 3 Russian companies: Charged with crimes relating to propaganda work done through social media. None of which will ever get convicted. The 13 nationals are beyond extradition and two of the companies have not responded. One company did.So out of 19 people indicted…..there has not been a single person who has pled guilty to a crime directly related with “collusion with Russia”. Not one. Many people fell into perjury traps but that it expected with any special prosecutor investigation.Now the 13 Russians/3 companies are a ‘show’ indictment. They were charged purely for the publicity and to give the investigation weight. It was never meant to make it to trial. Now that Concord Management (one of the three companies that Mueller charged but never expected to have to actually prosecute) is fighting back and demanding a court date, it gets tricky. They are asking for a speedy trial and immediate discovery. That is bad for Mueller. It means that if the judge grants their requests, the prosecution has to turn over their evidence, witness list, etc. All of the stuff they do not want out. So Mueller at that point will most likely drop the entire indictment to avoid having to release any information.So to answer your question, the media will always tout the 5 people who pled guilty in the Mueller investigation without pointing out those charges had nothing to do with actually conspiring with Russia. It won’t matter to the media.To be fair to the Democrats, Ken Starr was just a ruthless during the Whitewater investigation. He investigated everyone and got an insane amount of convictions.

A few strong candidates can and probably will pick up more momentum, and it will become more evident which candidates aren’t going to make the cut. We will also get a better view of this once we cross a couple primaries.That being said, at the moment I think it’s a tossup.We stand to lose a couple of seats in shaky territory, but I still (along with lots of other analysts) consider them tossups. I get that quite a few of these are “red states,” but the folks elected to these seats were also put there when 45 wasn’t in office. There is a bit more loyalty here for these individuals despite them being Democrats, and less incentive for the citizens of these states to go switching without a significant reason. It would have to take severe missteps on the part of these candidates in order for that to happen, which as far as I know, haven’t been made. I don’t think their chances of getting re-elected are going down necessarily.Heitkamp, McCaskill, Tester, Brown, Nelson, DonnellyYes, I get that this is a lot of vulnerable spots, but I think the prospect is scarier than the reality. I do think that we should expect to see Nelson, and Donnelly lose their seats, though.That being said, I think we have enough support from states that stand a good chance of losing a Republican seat to offset these potential losses.Of these I think Tennessee, Nevada, Texas, and Arizona are most likely to flip. With Nevada and Tennessee having the biggest chances. If we could squeeze out Arizona or Texas, then that would obviously be great, but I don’t think it’s far along enough in the game to tell right now if that’s a yay or a nay.I think Bredesen can take Tennessee.The primaries haven’t been held for the state yet, but Bredesen will get the nomination.He’s polling better[1] than the GOP favorite (Marsha Blackburn) who is trailing him slightly. While there is margin for error there, this is not a slam dunk for the GOP, and in a red state like Tennessee, this is not a good sign for them, and a very good sign for Democrats.I think Bredesen has the edge, being a familiar face (as he was twice elected Governor) and possessing a pretty large amount of crossover appeal. Which Blackburn doesn’t have. And right now, Tennessee really values that. I think this is his race to win. Blackburns to lose.Beto O’Rourke is outraising Cruz in a very large way. It’s kind of awe inspiring to watch.A native Texan. He’s created quite a stir. I think a close race is assured, and I think a win is very possible here.I think it’s too soon to say for sure, but give it a couple of months, and I think we will have a clearer picture.You may say “but, this is Texas.”And you’re right. It is Texas.So why is a Democrat outraising the Republican by millions without a PAC?Nevada is a blue state (voting wise), with a Republican senator, and not one they like very much. I don’t think Heller is staying in his seat.Not much more to say here.Arizona is really a bit too far out to tell. We won’t know until August. However, having three candidates for the GOP nomination is kinda making this one hard to predict. If McSally gets it, then were in trouble. If Ward gets it (still a possibility), were not. Arpaio is not getting it.

4,Why can’t the Left seem to grasp the fact that Hillary Clinton and the rest of the Democrats are what’s actually wrong with this country?,Democratic Party (US politics),Hillary Clinton,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Look here bud. I’ve lived through four presidents: Clinton, Bush, Obama, and now Trump. I don’t even remember Clinton (born ‘97). I barely remember Bush but I fully remember just how badly he bungled the war in Iraq and then how badly the economy folded on his watch. He was so unpopular by the end of his Presidency that even some of the most ardent Republicans had turned on him by the end.So for the sake of argument, let’s say that I’ve been conscious, meaning that I had a basic understanding their actions, of two presidents: Obama and Trump. There is no comparison in my mind. Obama could be maddeningly indecisive sometimes and under his leadership, the vast technocracy that was built up was often inefficient at the best of times. There were times when I wondered, where’s Obama when you need him and why did he do this when this would have worked so much better. There was even a point at which I got so frustrated with his activities that I considered changing my registration to Republican. But at the end of the day, I had enough faith in the man’s consistency to be able to go to sleep knowing that we had a diligent watchman in the White House and that I had a general idea of what he was going to do.Having put up with Trump for nearly three years by this point, all the way back when he first declared his candidacy, I see none of the traits that made me trust Obama. He is disinterested in the job, fails to learn from anyone or anything, and has generally spent the past three years behaving like a dick to everyone. His blithe attitude is absolutely terrifying and I have no idea what he’s going to do next. I have no patience for crazy like a fox. And as for his government, I’d take the Democratic technocracy with all its inefficiencies, red tape, and slowness over the much worse Republican kleptocracy. Under full Republican control: nepotism and cronyism are rampant, there’s more FUD, and the minute a real crisis hits this country, I have absolutely no confidence that Trump will be able to deal with it.So quite frankly, I don’t see any way in which the Democrats, Obama, or Hillary are the problem with this country. I find them maddeningly indecisive at times and their solutions often don’t work the way they intend. But I also know that they would never tolerate the current government the way Republicans are. They would never have allowed Betsy Devos to get out of committee let alone serve as Secretary of Education, would have effectively vetted Michael Flynn before making him National Security Advisor, and would most certainly not be turning a blind eye to the very real issue of a foreign power interfering in our electoral integrity. What you don’t seem to realize is that those of us who came of age or are coming of age, along with everyone else in this country, can see what’s going on. We can see what the President and Congress do everyday: Twitter doesn’t lie, live-streaming doesn’t lie, it is easier nowadays to catch someone in the act than at any point in history. And quite frankly, it doesn’t reflect well on people like you when you openly insist on something that very obviously never happened.",491,23,34,298,0,0
4,Why can’t the Left seem to grasp the fact that Hillary Clinton and the rest of the Democrats are what’s actually wrong with this country?,Democratic Party (US politics),Hillary Clinton,1!,1!,1!,1!,"The obstacle is liberals themselves. Liberals displayed an infuriating inability to understand both their own self-interest and the nature of the problems that faced the country — and the liberal/progressive quarterbacking is evidence that they still haven't learned their lesson.First, apropos of Paul Krugman, let's consider an alternate history that might have won Democrats the 2010 election. The moment Obama is inaugurated, Senate Democrats use their supermajority to pass a stimulus twice as big as the Recovery Act, plus 25 percent to be safe, plus additional triggers for more stimulus in case unemployment didn't come down fast enough, topped off with a big homeowner assistance package. They immediately fill empty seats on the Federal Reserve board with fervent advocates of monetary stimulus. They pass aggressively left-wing health care reform — what came out of the House, or universal Medicare.With the help of filibuster reform, all this could have been done at the same time. Indeed, this agenda could have been polished off in a couple of months, instead of wasting weeks of floor time letting cloture petitions ripen. This program could have easily gotten unemployment down to 5-6 percent. It would have inspired massive enthusiasm and turnout among Democrats.In reality, the stimulus was too small (which was painfully obvious at the time). Homeowner assistance was a colossal failure. ObamaCare, a bloated mix of conservative and liberal proposals, was caricatured as a commie assault on freedom anyway. By election month in 2010, unemployment was 9.8 percent, only two tenths of a percentage point from its peak in 2009.The reason all this happened is that Democrats, especially in the Senate, are a bunch of spineless porridge creatures, wholly owned by the financial sector, who continually failed to grasp that being cautious and timid in power during a huge recession was highly politically risky. They were obsessed with ridiculous Beltway shibboleths like the deficit, and got slaughtered at the polls as a result.Progressives have a lot to learn in the wake of Donald Trump’s astounding victory 2 years ago, and chief among those lessons may be this: the old ways don’t seem to work anymore. The tried-and-true formula of liberal success served reasonably well throughout the young twenty-first century and quite well throughout much of the second half of the twentieth. Yet this boiling stew of identity politics centering on race, sex, and sexual orientation failed the Democrats at precisely the moment it should have been their Excalibur. That means no more “war on women” hysteria, no more wild claims that Republicans are going to send black Americans back to the antebellum South, no more screaming that proponents of traditional marriage are morally and functionally equivalent to Nazis. Regarding the “narrower…highly charged” issues, especially “those touching on sexuality and religion.Many liberals have grown up in a toxic social-media-fueled stew of racial histrionics and paranoia: they have been taught that every police shooting of a black man is a modern-day lynching, every real or imagined “microagression” against an ethnic minority is an act of mini-terrorism, and every criticism of a black president is a hatred-fueled injustice. Knee-jerk beliefs like this are difficult to unlearn, particularly as mainstream liberals in politics and the media have more or less reinforced them for the better part of a decade.In schools under the direction of the liberal National Education Association and other like-minded state education associations and departments of education, the liberals have systematically dismantled our educational system over the past three decades or more in hopes of recreating it in their image.The quality of education has declined precipitously in all areas — math, reading, English, science, civics, history, etc. — under their direction, and has been supplanted in large part by such things as sex education, gender identity, political indoctrination, safe spaces for overly sensitive students, social and moral experimentation, etc., etc. But they would love to blame conservatives because It is typical of liberals to blame conservatives for the problems they create.Liberals do thier utmost to destroy free speech and we see this every day as campus agitators use identity politics to grant certain opinions authority based on the race, gender, etc. of those who espouse them, and insist that those with opposing points of view are committing “verbal violence” and that physical violence can be used to combat it. Social media platforms have become censors. Twitter, Facebook, Instagram et.al have all started censoring speech they find offensive. Normally that falls within the conservative realm.Is it all liberals..no..it isnt. But they own a large share of the problems. Examples are Political correctness achieves the opposite of its intent, Redistribution of wealth fails to achieve economic equality and prosperity, Centrally planned economies fail more people than they help, Private property rights protect the environment better than big government, Capitalism causes more wealth than big government, Equal protection under the law is impossible under liberalism, Liberalism cannot protect citizens while appeasing the enemies of the culture and last but not least The “safety net “ has no protection from wasteful politicians and will go bankrupt financially while simultaneously promoting a culture of dependence.Liberalism itself excuses irresponsible behavior by appeasing the mooching voters with redistributed wealth. And thus, perpetuates poor fiscal habits by denying free citizens the important freedom to fail from their poor decisions and to learn (and possibly to improve) from necessary mistakes. This denial of human nature and needed education in reality is a function of liberal inability to accept the proven self corrective characteristics of individual liberty and capitalism. Individually, sheltered children have an obvious and distinct disadvantage from children whose parents allowed their exploration of life’s trials and tribulations. Sheltered children grow into spoiled and dependent adults.",148,0,12,9,0,1

2,Do you think people who criticize CIA Haspel benefit from hindsight when she had to make the unpopular decision under uncertainty to get intelligence before another 9/11 terror event?,9/11 Conspiracy Theories,Central Intelligence Agency,1!,1!,1!,1!,"I answered a similarly-themed question, How likely is it that the U.S. government resumes torturing (specifically waterboarding) prisoners should Gina Haspel be confirmed as CIA Director? I believe my answer suffices here:There is a scene from the movie The Ghost Writer in which the former British Prime Minister Adam Lang, played by Pierce Brosnan, is confronted by his ghostwriter, played by Ewan McGregor. Lang has been accused by his former Foreign Minister Richard Rycart of aiding and abetting CIA to execute its extraordinary rendition program, under which a detainee was waterboarded and subsequently died—a war crime.The Ghostwriter accuses Lang of secretly working for CIA. An argument between the two culminates in Lang stating that he would have two flights: one on which no security checks had been done and no information had been obtained from detained terrorists using extralegal methods; on the other flight Lang would do everything within his power to protect the lives of everyone on board, including torture. Then Lang asks which plane would the Rycarts of the world put their children on?We are 17 years removed from 9/11. There is a generation alive today who regard the most heinous terrorist attack on American soil from the languor and distance of history. The exigency of that time, to thwart future attacks, is now viewed through a revisionist lens that questions the morality of CIA’s actions at a time when this country’s enemies viewed morality as America’s weakness.Extraordinary rendition, a limited program begun during President Bill Clinton’s administration, was expanded dramatically after the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.[1]“Foreign nationals suspected of terrorism have been transported to detention and interrogation facilities in Jordan, Iraq, Egypt, Diego Garcia, Afghanistan, Guantánamo, and elsewhere. In the words of former CIA agent Robert Baer: ’If you want a serious interrogation, you send a prisoner to Jordan. If you want them to be tortured, you send them to Syria. If you want someone to disappear -- never to see them again -- you send them to Egypt.’”[2]The program was intended to protect America; its effect, however, was to strip the detainees of their basic human rights. Was the program illegal? According to a congressional act and international treaties to which the United States is a signatory, the answer is yes.[3]There is no question that individuals given absolute power over others will abuse that power. Some men and women did indulge their sadistic fantasies, inflicting the most debasing punishment on the detainees.While some information obtained during these sessions was useful in averting future plots, most of what was learned was useless. In many cases the detainees simply said what their interrogators wanted to hear in order to stop the torture.It was with hindsight and a refocusing of this nation’s moral compass that President Barack Obama sought to look forward rather than to the past and outlaw waterboarding. Unfortunately, President Trump’s lack of morality, buoyed by his affinity for methodologies that dehumanize the individual, have raised questions such as the one to which I am responding.Time yields perspective, and sometimes wisdom. CIA and the American people, by and large, have learned from the past. In 2001, I believe CIA’s actions were consistent with the extant tenor of this country. Today, I believe Gina Haspel when she says CIA will reject any and all orders to implement torture—even if rendered by the president himself.[1] Fact Sheet: Extraordinary Rendition [2] Ibid.

2,Do you think people who criticize CIA Haspel benefit from hindsight when she had to make the unpopular decision under uncertainty to get intelligence before another 9/11 terror event?,9/11 Conspiracy Theories,Central Intelligence Agency,1!,1!,1!,1!,"I’m not sure where you are going with this question. I don’t intend to create a “strawman argument” so if I’m off-base on what I’m implying from the question, please correct me.Having said that, I can only see two ways of interpreting your “hindsight” remark. Either critics:Only now realized that torture is ineffective but didn’t know that at the timeAlso believed that there would be follow-on attacks which turned out to be false and therefore not warranting of tortureIn either case, I think this is a wrong view of the critics. And largely for the same reason.If your suggestion was point 1, that implies that the critics would not be critics now if torture had “worked.” And there may be some who believe that to be the case but the vast majority of people object to torture on moral grounds not effectiveness grounds. Those who do object based on the success rate of torture are probably just buying into repetitive memes about “torture never works” or that the “rapport” method is more effective.[1]But that’s not why you don’t torture people. You don’t torture people because it is morally reprehensible. You don’t inflict pain on someone who cannot defend themselves. The article you cite specifically references the “black site” in Thailand. The most notable “guest” at that facility was abu Zubaydah who was shot in the thigh, the testicle, and the stomach and was assessed by a doctor as “never before seen a patient survive such severe wounds.”And then he was tortured. That’s wrong.In “hindsight”, it doesn’t matter if torture works or not. You don’t do it.As for the second point, there were follow-on attacks being planned. KSM had another contingent of student-pilots preparing to repeat 9/11 on the West Coast. When he got captured though, the plan fell apart and focused instead on attacking targets within Pakistan.But there were still more attacks coming. In Madrid. In London.So speaking strictly of “in hindsight”, there were attacks to be stopped. Some were. Some weren’t. Regardless of how we treated the prisoners.So no, the critics are not benefiting from hindsight when they say torture is wrong or because they think now that there were no other attacks to stop.Footnotes[1] Brian K.

In addition, it should be noted that in 2008, superdelegates who had promised to vote for Clinton switched their votes to Obama once the people chose Obama.However, had Clinton actually been as bad a candidate as I believe that Trump would have been, the superdelegates would have voted for Sanders instead of Trump, if the primary choice had been Sanders and Trump.It should also be noted that, during the 2016 primary, there were a number of Republicans who stated how much they loved the Democratic idea of superdelegates. There were a number of RNC people who wished they had had superdelegates.Simple answer: No, the superdelegates do not dilute the power of the voters under normal conditions.

A few examples are: infrastructure spending, skilled trades education and training, and a compromise on migrant workers that would clarify legal status for everyone and reduce uncertainty and risk for employers.The problem is, the Democrat base is extremely stratified. The elite, donor base is highly protected professional workers, academia, entertainment, media, etc. They provide the funds and publicity for liberal candidates.But the voting numbers come from the dense urban cores of cities. They are disproportionately minority and they have felt the effects of globalism and stagnating economic growth. They don’t work in jobs that require a decade of university credentials.But the funds and publicity come from people whose biggest concern is carbon dioxide and boutique social issues like forceful enlistment of Mom and Pop bakeries. Any hint of cooperation with the president would fatally condemn the candidate from the elite network.The DNC realizes this and has been working assiduously behind the scenes to draft military veterans for races, and to force out progressive candidates. They’re trying to convince alt-left candidates not to run in the primaries so that their donor base doesn’t even have the option of a elite hero candidate to support.I think they did a lot to cook their own goose in the immediate aftermath of the 2016 election with all of the overwrought hysteria. Prominent media figures and politicians were seriously accusing Trump of being a dictator, of collaborating with a foreign government to get elected, and of being too stupid to handle basic governance. News organizations were predicting imminent market collapse, wars, and National Guard troops rounding up immigrants by the million.They set the bar so extremely low, but as it turns out, any neutral observer would have to conclude Trump has certainly been no less successful than Obama in terms of the economy and foreign policy. This primarily serves to weaken public trust in the media and the elite who got everything so catastrophically wrong.If the media and elite can’t explain why their predictions were so backwards, why would their current set of theories and warnings hold any water?The Democrat’s main advantage for the past 25 years has been a legacy media to serve as their mouth piece that still had trust from the general public retained from an earlier era.

As much as the Democrats can concentrate on things like these while avoiding the mention of Trump himself, I think they will be successful: “I want to focus, not on what has not been done, but on what we will do; not on promises broken, but on promises we will keep!”It would also be extremely important for them to court the 18-30 crowd, who are drowning in student loan debt, terrified of nuts with easy access to guns, and want the government to stay out of their private lives.

The critical issues will vary between each one: a rural Midwestern working class district and a coastal suburban professional class district will have different priorities.There’s a funny story I have to tell. On Wednesday, this was CNN’s headline: CNN poll: Democrats' 2018 advantage is nearly gone. What’s funny is that at the exact same time, they had this article: CNN House Key Race Alert: Four races move toward Democrats after Tuesday's primaries. Funny, huh? Why would CNN have two seemingly completely different assessments up at the exact same time? It all goes back to the problem of polling: too many people take polling as the exact outcome, so when its off, everyone immediately goes on about how the polls were wrong and how polling is useless. The truth is that polling is more of an average. Basically, you need to take all the polls at that time to have an idea of the outcome. The useful metric for what’s going to happen this November is not the generic polling: its how the rating metrics are shifting. So far, there has been a small but steady shift of seats towards the Democrats. Last July, Democrats were planning to target 25 Republican held districts where Clinton beat Trump. Now, that number has expanded considerably to 80 Republican districts where any of the following is true:Clinton carried the district in 2016.The Democratic candidate has proved an effective campaigner and fundraiser.There is no Republican incumbent.A previously bulls**t map was struck down by the state’s supreme court creating a significantly fairer map (Pennsylvania and maybe North Carolina).And at this point, its worth mentioning that while the Fox News poll found a narrow Democratic lead, other pollsters have continued to show a Democratic lead with an average of about 7 or 8 points that’s consistent with the past three to four months. Another factor to consider is that solid Democratic support has remained fairly consistent at about 47%-48% for the past three months whereas solid Republican support has seen greater variance from lows of about 38% to highs of about 41%.So as things currently stand, the Democrats are absolutely favored to take the House.

0,How did the United States expand politically and democratically?,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Since the term ""United States"" can have several meanings, according to the SCOTUS, and they are mutually exclusive, I will answer your question using one of the SCOTUS's meanings, the federal government.The term “United States”, unless noted, when singular is equal to the “territory of the Federal Government” or just the “Federal Government” when needed for clarification; when the term is plural it means the “Several States”. We can then substitute “Federal Government” and “Several States” for their respective term of “United States” per the second and third definitions given in Hooven & Allison co. v. Evatt, 324 U.S. 652 (1945).Let’s look at the 13th Amendment again substituting equal terms to clarify its meaning..Section 1. Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime where of the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the SEVERAL STATES, or any place subject to THEIR jurisdiction. (emphasis mine)The 13th Amendment states explicitly that: Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime where of the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the Several States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction popANDImplicitly states that: slavery and involuntary servitude shall exist within the Federal Government, or any place subject to the jurisdiction thereof. The punishment exception doesn’t apply here since it is negated by the implicit allowance of involuntary servitude.This problem of explicitly forbidding one thing and implicitly allowing others is common when people write laws to ban certain behaviors they find objectionable. They find a need to continually amend the law to cover more and more behaviors implicitly allowed because once you get too specific a lot of things can fall through the cracks.It’s similar to the commercial where a girl is talking to a friend over a “land line” because her parents had forbidden her to use her cell phone since she was grounded. As she stated, “loophole!!!”.The 14th AmendmentSection 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside…..The 14th Amendment states its area of law is “…THE United States, and subject to THE jurisdiction thereof…” The term here is singular, the jurisdiction, or else it would be their jurisdiction or the jurisdictions. Hence it refers to the territory of the Federal Government. It can be stated also as Congress or the District of Columbia.Remember that the U.S. Constitution and the State Constitutions are contracts in nature and as such should follow the “Four Corners” doctrine. Essentially, if it is not addressed within the four corners of the document it is not addressed and must not be assumed.""Privileges and immunities clause of Fourteenth Amendment protects only those rights peculiar to being citizen of federal government; it does not protect those rights which relate to state citizenship.""Jones v. Temmer, Federal Supplement, Vol. 829, Page 1227 (1993)The fourteenth amendment created citizenship of the federal government. This status is a privilege granted by the government.""We have cited these cases for the purpose of showing that the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States do not necessarily include all the rights protected by the first eight amendments to the Federal Constitution against the powers of the Federal government. They were decided subsequently to the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment...""Maxwell v. Dow, 176 US 598 (1900)And from the Slaughter-House Cases in 1873:""The first clause of the fourteenth article was primarily intended to confer citizenship on the Negro race, and secondly to give definitions of citizenship of the United States, and citizenship of the States, and it recognizes the distinction between citizenship of a State and citizenship of the United States by those definitions.The second clause protects from the hostile legislation of the States the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States as distinguished from the Privileges and Immunities of citizens of the States.The privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States are those which arise out of the nature and essential character of the NATIONAL GOVERNMENT, the provisions of its Constitution, or its laws and treaties made in pursuance thereof; and it is these which are placed under the protection of Congress by this clause of the fourteenth amendment."" (emphasis added)So if you are a citizen under the14th amendment you are not one of “We The People” but under the jurisdiction of the “National government”. Please remember that we are supposed to have a federal government not a national one. The 14th amendment allows the federal government to have it own citizens separated from the protections afforded state Citizens.America is supposed to be a Constitutional Republic but that term no longer is true. The term is now part of phrases that, while at one time were correct, are now just false assumptions. Among the false assumptions are: Innocent until proven guilty; Right to marry; Right to Travel, part of Liberty per SCOTUS; Right to Property, included in Pursuit of Happiness, per SCOTUS. There are more but this will suffice for now.The Republic formerly known as The united States of America died a quiet death in the 1930's following a mortal wound inflicted in the 1860's. In it's place, a feudal democracy was instituted. The presiding rulers lord over the domain from Washington DC with lesser nobles at state and local levels.Their subjects, all current Americans, are given the impression of being able to elect people who represent themselves but are simply choosing from a cast of preselected clones.This feudal democracy, known as the federal government, currently consists of 50 federal states created by the Buck Act. These can be recognized by their two-uppercase-case letter abbreviations: CA; NJ; AZ; etc. The former Republic's States had abbreviations such as: Ca. or Calif.; N.J.; Az. or Ariz.; etc.The insidious destruction of the Republic occurred during times of war and strife. The former free Citizens, being more concerned about security and well-being were seemingly unaware of the catastrophic consequences of their inattentiveness and trust in corrupt politicians.As meer subjects, Americans must pay their overseers for most of the things We the People did freely by Right. They can now have their property taken and given to anyone else by their overseers. They must pay yearly tribute to use their own vehicles on the, supposedly, public roads in the form of licenses and registrations. They must pay for the PRIVILEGE of getting married.Some of you will raise the canard of: ""Show me a better country"" or ""If you don't like it here then leave"". This is the same as two slaves sitting on a fence and one says,""I like my master because he only beats me three times a week while yours beat you five!"". They are still slaves but have been so for so long that they cannot think in other terms, like actually being free.This is how the United States (federal government) expanded politically and democratically; it overthrew the American Republic by capitalizing on social, economic and military upheavals most of which it created in the first place.",80,2,14,38,0,0

Democrats love clean energy and eliminating oil and gas pipelines which adversely affect the environment.Medicare for all, but only if they lie about having to raise taxes. Americans have a notorious aversion for paying taxes. It’s that whole American individualism thing; I’m more important than my community, why would I pay so others don’t die of disease, yadda-yadda.Taking marijuana off Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act, which allows medical research. A great deal of the veteran community currently suffering from combination of PTSD and Substance Use Disorder (opioids and alcohol) are managing the symptoms of both through illegal marijuana use. This is a good thing to run with to win public support, but Congress (no matter what color it is) will probably never go for it. They get too much money from pharmaceutical companies, who depend on opioid sales in order to make a profit. Decriminalized marijuana will mean a shift in pain management techniques, as well as eliminations of many medications prescribed for depression and anxiety, and pharmaceutical companies will never allow it.Opioid Crisis Solutions go hand in hand with this. Basically any Democrat with enough balls to go after pharmaceutical companies for the damage they’ve done with the so-called “non-addictive” opiates which have triggered the current crisis will have the popular vote. They probably won’t have as much money as those who decide to stay silent on the subject and let big pharma line their pockets, so they probably won’t win, but Democrats will love them.National Licensing and Registering of firearms. The majority of the public will love it, the minority will likely shoot up a few government buildings or schools. NRA will threaten to pull their funding from the representatives they’ve been buying off for years. It’ll suck, but Democrats will love it.Free college. This was one of Bernie’s most popular issues, and no matter how you feel about Bernie, don’t forget that he managed to run neck and neck with Hillary on an average donation of $27 and no corporate funding. Also, the changing demographics are showing that majority of democrats are more likely to have a college education vs majority of conservatives. That means Democrats are more likely to be carrying that $1.3 trillion student loan debt. Free college will win their votes in a heartbeat.Women’s rights. Me too movement. Pay equality.

If they do, he likely will either not complete his term, or he will not run. In either case, that would make it a cake walk for them.On the other hand, if all that comes out of years of investigations is that he paid some whore not to talk about a sexual liaison, then it is going to be Bill Clinton 2.0, and they will look like fools.But those are not “issues,” per se.In a normal election cycle (no carnival barker in the White House), I suggest that the following are “winning” issues for the Democrats.The debt and the recent tax reform. When even conservatives like myself recognise that the tax cuts were largely a solution looking for a problem - and a poor solution at that - that are going to balloon our national debt, I suggest that rolling back the cuts will be a winning issue.Climate Change. This is the opposite of gun control, which I am going to take a contrarian position and say is a losing issue for the Democrats. Climate change action is one of those things that the single issue voters support. Loudly. Most Americans I think see this (and more to the point, the solutions proposed) as kind of “meh” issues down the list. But for those who care a lot about it, they want the government to do something. The Democrats can push this issue and gain votes without the risk of losing many, which is the polar opposite of guns, where most people do not really think it is a core issue, but those who vote primarily due to guns, are second amendment types.Women’s issues. The Democrats simply need to win big among single women. And they need them to turn out. I hate to say it because abortion rights in my opinion are a distraction - no one is seriously going to reverse Roe v Wade. But for many younger women, putting a “war on women” front and centre will get them to show up. And if they do, they will vote Democrat.Free trade. I know it’s counter intuitive, but the Democrats made inroads in 2016 with suburban white professionals. They can continue to win this bloc by attacking Trump on protectionism and unilateral withdrawal from trade deals. The trade war that may come with China would be an issue.

If one home-state Senator returned a negative blue slip, no further action would be taken on the nominee.""2003: A return of a negative blue slip by one or both home-state Senators does not prevent the committee from moving forward with the nomination — provided that the Administration has engaged in pre-nomination consultation with both of the home-state Senators.""In October 2017, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced that he believed blue slips should not prevent committee action on a nominee.”In the future it can be changed again..",53,0,24,452,0,2

Not all of them can vote, yes, but all of them can offer powerful messages to try pushing others – be them strangers, family, or friends – to do so.Many Republicans in general probably know they have a lot to lose and need to fight hard against a potential blue wave being talked about.

In this context, left = “liberal” = Democrat and right = “conservative” = Republican by today’s standards.As a left-libertarian in practice and an anarchosocialist at heart, I am definitely to the left of the Democrats, although that party shares far more of my values in terms of civil rights, etc. than does the GOP.

All of America’s political evolution, when viewed through this lens, is to the Right (substituting the King for Federal/Centralized authority). The only exception to this rule is America’s denial of rights to race minorities when they were targeted for legal discrimination. For them, extending political rights, as defined for everyone else in enlightenment thinking, should be seen as a move to the Left.Since most American political evolution has been towards Centralized/Federalized power, we enlightenment advocates can be seen as wanting to conserve a past (and eroding) political order, hence it’s not unreasonable to consider us Conservative. It can get all jumbled up when we add in those Americans who wish to conserve religious values, though.Few Americans speak the vocabulary of “Classical Liberal,” or “Neo-Liberal.” “Progressive” seems to be accepted now.If you display a swastika, you will have some ‘spainin’” to do, if your intention is in the Buddhist sense.

This puts me on the left of the mainstream (old school, really) Democratic Party spectrum, (but the speech part makes me an enemy of Progressives). People who don’t know me, when they hear me discussing the interplay of mental illness and drug addiction, the anathema of violence, militarism and foreign adventures, they conclude I’m Liberal, Left (neo-Liberal).A listener who hears me decry regulatory capture, excessive, self-serving regulation, and Byzantine, growth-destroying tax codes, or one group of people being held responsible for the follows of another would infer that I was on the Right Wing (I don’t get into guns too much, but if I did it would be “pro gun” whatever that means).So: Left of Democrats, Right of Republicans, is just about right.",69,2,53,329,0,0

The party platforms are unreadable nonsense, long lists of things no one expects to have any influence on legislation, and which often conflict.One of my favorite examples is that the Republican party for over 100 years was the champion of rights for African-Americans, fighting segregation and both de facto and de jure discrimination. This was not any great love for either justice or African-Americans among party leaders, it was just a strategy for getting votes.Then, in 1963, Democrats made a strategic shift and decided to go for African American votes at the expense of some of their traditional white constituencies. Remember, when I say the Democrats opposed the interests of African Americans for over a century, I don’t mean they were against affirmative action, I mean they were in favor of lynching—literally.But Lyndon Johnson, for decades a champion of African-American oppression, signed the Civil Rights Act in 1963 (although passed with mainly Republican votes). This complete reversal of principle on such a key social issue did not change the nature of either party, any more than if one baseball team trades players with another.Both political parties are non-libertarian in principle. They exist for people who want to get things from the government. The larger and more powerful the government is, the more things to give away, and the larger and more powerful the parties are.Therefore, as a libertarian, you tend to find yourself fighting the centerists, the people who worship bi-partisan compromise. This basically means two baskets of goodies are given away, of roughly equal size, to both parties’ constituents. Your allies tend to be on the radical wings of both parties, who are fighting for principles, not special favors. A libertarian’s natural sympathies are with people fighting for their freedom, rather than people seeking to force everyone to accept a consensus (or corrupt) position.Things change over time. For most of my lifetime, libertarians were the only straight people fighting hard for gay rights. Civil libertarians were usually on the side of repealing criminal sanctions against homosexuals, but were not anxious to talk about things like gay marriage, non-discrimination in law or gays in the military.About a decade ago, the bipartisan anti-gay consensus (as symbolized by the overwhelming support for the 1998 Defense of Marriage Act) broke down, and gay rights moved from a fringe issue on the Democrats Left wing to a bipartisan consensus principle deserving of protection.Once gay political groups gained centerist traction, the alliance with libertarians was severed. Sadly (but unsurprisingly) the passion for letting consenting adults do what they like as long as no one else was hurt, was not extended to other oppressed groups—such as Christian bakers or people who spoke in favor of antediluvian moral codes. Today, libertarians are likely to find themselves on the opposite side of gay activists.So not only are libertarians more comfortable with the Democratic Left and the Republican Right than anyone in the middle, we tend to maintain that position even as formerly extreme views become mainstream and formerly centerist ideas become blasphemous.",460,13,5k,"5,790",0,0

A conservative is a function of the thing they want to conserve. Different people want to conserve very different things.

Grouping then under the heading of ‘conservative’ is a symptom of an inadequate and confusing system of political categorization. The groups might rarely overlap, but they don’t have to. And in the case of racism, people who support individual rights and civil liberties tends to be less willing to accept institutional racism. Racism, in its active form, is a form of collectivism.Also, consider that if we’re adopting the notion that the “Right Wing” is conservative then why aren’t those opposed to global warming considered “Right Wing?” They want the earth to stay the same and fear the notion that it might change.

33,Why do Democrats seem to forget that the KKK was founded as the militant arm of the Democratic party after the Civil War?,Ku Klux Klan,U.S. Civil War,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,"Of course Democrats know this.. at least those familiar with their history. Sort of.. .it wasn’t actually an “arm of the Democratic Party.” But it was founded by people hostile to Lincoln’s Republicans in those days. Democrats often will also know that the KKK died out completely and was re-formed twice since its original formation.The first version of the KKK was formed in the 1860s by Confederate veterans, working to overthrow Republicans in government (e.g., aligned with the Democrats if not directly a “branch” of the Democratic Party) during the post Civil War Reconstruction. It pretty much had died out by the mid 1870s. Members in those days wore robes and conical hats, but colorful, not the white that a later version would introduce.The second version of the KKK was organized in the mid 1910s and lasted through the 1920s. This was an urban organization, primarily in the Midwest and the West, not Southern. Rather than being political, it was associated with various Protestant churches, and sought to oppose Catholics and Jews, who were increasing fast in number due to immigration. This version adopted the white robes, cross burnings, and the big parades. It’s estimated this version peaked with about 2 million members, but it vanished by the the end of the decade.Harry Truman and the End of Official Democratic RacismThe “trouble” started in 1945, when President Roosevelt died and Harry S. Truman became President. He first issues Executive Order 9808, forming the President’s Committee on Civil Rights. That commission came back in late 1947 with a report recommending that the Fed establish a permanent Civil Rights Commission, a Civil Rights Division in the DoJ, and a Joint Congressional Committee on Civil Rights. He sent a request to Congress in early 1948 asking them to establish their committee, and proceeded to issue Executive Orders 9980 and 9981, which officially banned discrimination based on race, color, religion, or national origin in the Executive Branch and the Military, respectively.Soon following these EOs, the Democrats held their Presidential Convention. Truman was re-nominated as their candidate, and the Democrats officially adopted a plank in their platform that called for civil rights. That led to thirty-five Democrats walking out.Some of these Democrats got together, calling themselves first the States Rights Democrats, to figure out what to do. They ultimately decided to run their own candidate, without initially deciding to form as a separate Party. They ran Governor Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, whith a strategy to capture as many of the 127 Southern electoral votes as possible, to throw the election into the House of Representatives. At that point, they were to add their support for whichever party agreed to support their segregationist platform. They finished carrying four states and 39 electoral votes. But Truman won anyway, and many of the so-called Dixiecrats were lured back into the Democratic Party.This did not go over well with many in the South. From the start of Truman’s support of the various civil rights actions, small, disconnected groups around the South appeared under the banner of the Ku Klux Klan, this time actively opposing civil rights legislation and actions in any form they could. Once Truman was elected, much of that was levelled against Democrats more than Republicans, as at the time they felt the Democratic Party had betrayed them.Johnson and The Permanent BreakRather than just a Truman thing, the Democrats gradually moved to become the party of the civil rights movement. President John F. Kennedy gave a transformational speech on civil rights in 1963, proposing the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The particular timing was to help defuse a stand-off segregationist Governor George Wallace of Alabama, based on the Supreme Court decision in Brown vs. Board of Education, Topeka Kansas, which ruled that segregated public schooling is Unconstitutional.Kennedy was of course assassinated (November 22, 1963) before he was able to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964. But newly sworn in President Lyndon B. Johnson took up the mission. Johnson worked tirelessly to get the bill through Congress, and signed it on July 2, 1964. At least according to legend, Johnson was said to have remarked to an aide, “We have lost the South for a generation.”Whether said it or not, the effect was quick. Two weeks later, the Republicans nominated Senator Barry Goldwater (Arizona) for President, one of the few Republicans who did not support the bill. Keep that in mind: most Republicans in Congress also voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1964. But the party leaders clearly saw political opportunity to paint Johnson and the Democrats with this brush. Two month later, now-Senator Strom Thurmond switched to the Republican Party and started backing Goldwater’s campaign (he went on to be a prominent backer of Nixon and Reagan, too). It wasn’t overnight… Jesse Helms switched to the Republican in 1970, Trent Lott moved in 1972, etc.While the racists were slowly leaving the Democratic Party, those backing the Civil Rights Act were finding a hard time in the Republican Party. Many in the Congress, the Senate, and state-level offices lost primary challenges to anti-Civil Rights challengers. Some jumped ship directly to the Democrats, others ran as independents initially.The move was fairly well cemented in 1968 with Nixon’s “Southern Strategy,” a plan pushed hard to Nixon by Thurmond and by Nixon’s strategist, Kevin Phillips. They looked upon the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (another civil rights victory by Johnson) as an engine to push blacks into the Democratic party and thus move racists into the Republican Party. And sure enough, it worked… Nixon won the South and he won the election in 1968 and again in 1972. Reagan ran a modified version of this, also appealing to politically motivated far right evangelicals, welcoming them into the Republican Party officially. And that worked out for him as well.As for the KKK, the versions that started up in the days of the Dixiecrats are what we have today. The Dixiecrats were a splinter of racists out of the Democratic Party in the 1940s, most eventually joining the Republicans in the 1968 election. There are about 31 different, independent KKK organizations in 190 active units in 25 states, with an estimated membership of 5,000–7,000 people. Politicians may dog-whistle the Klan, as Trump did in the election, but that’s about it… it’s not really a smart move for any politician to show alignment with the KKK in modern times.UPDATEOk, so I was wrong. Trump has continued to dog-whistle and even quite openly act as apologist-in-chief for the KKK, the American Nazi Party, and in general, White Supermacists. He’s got several on his staff, including Stephen Bannon, Sebastian Gorka, Michael Anton, and Stephen Miller.

It was formed by Confederate veterans, originally a social club dedicated to the antebellum status quo, and was not exclusively Democratic. It was certainly an anti-Republican organization and to that extent it favored the Democratic Party in the South, but it was Radical Reconstruction that inspired it. It cut across class and occupation and even included a few Republicans. The Klan faded out after a generation and a second version formed in the 1920’s that was anti-Catholic, anti-Immigrant and anti-semitic and thereby opposed both white and black individuals. This version of the Klan more resembled the current alt-Right movement than anything Democratic and was its own entity and not included in the Democratic Party.It is important to recall how different the political parties have been over the last 161 years (dating from the formation of the Republican Party) and how they have evolved. There were both liberal and conservative factions in both parties until recently. During the 19th Century to the end of the Civil War the Democratic Party was pro-slavery and that faction continued in the form of the Segregationist and “pro-White” Dixiecrats. Their last strong influence was during FDR’s long term and he needed them politically to get his New Deal reforms passed. not as a “militant wing”. That version of the Klan waned during the Depression and WWII and disbanded in 1944. After WWII Truman strongly led the Democrats in the direction of Civil Rights for all U.S. Citizens and the Dixiecrats walked out of the 1948 Democratic Convention forming the States Rights Democratic Party that ran Strom Thurmond, who would later become a Republican, for President.The Klan reformed in the 1960’s as a response to the Civil Rights movement; the Democratic Party was by then a Civil Rights party whose proposed reforms were opposed by Barry Goldwater, the 1964 Republican Presidential Candidate, and Ronald Reagan, the 1980 Republican Presidential Candidate. The Klan was certainly not a “militant arm” of the Democratic Party then.The claim is Fake History and is being peddled by many on the Right most recently as a counter to their naked attempts to disenfranchise minority Citizens because they tend to vote for Democratic candidates. This lends the Right a bad reputation and this slander is a tactic to counter bad press resulting. I have heard it promulgated by many of the Conservative Radio hosts and a film to that effect has been produced and distributed by a Conservative activist whom I will not name but will note is a convicted Felon.

They are basically loose baggy collections of interest groups looking for alliances rather than coherent organizations with fixed identities.During the Civil War, and for quite some time after, it was the Republican that leaned towards progressivism while it was the democrats who represented reactionary rural elites. The Democrats tended to be populist which is how they ended up sliding to the progressive center (although never really the Left per se) whereas the Republicans, believe it or not, were identified with more radical liberal ideas (liberal in the classical sense).America is a “modern” country that has never had a hereditary aristocracy or a feudal society so it has no real “conservative” tradition in the way this is usually understood in Europe. American conservatism is largely a form of liberal conservatism and there is no Tory tradition (unlike in Canada). America was seen as the land of Whigs and Progressives rather than Tories and Liberals.The Democrats, like the Republicans, have evolved over time in a way that is consistent in itself but makes little sense if we try to see Republicanism and Democratism as fixed ideologies. Until the 1960s, the Democrats were seen in the South as “Dixiecrats” but Kennedy and LBJ embracing civil rights were deal breakers for the Southern white democrats and they defected en masse to the Republicans, giving it much of the reactionary, Bible-bashing,”Jethro the hillbilly” flavor it has today. 2 generations ago, most of the “guns, bibles and hooch” set were Democrats but today they run Republican. I doubt they have changed much ideologically; they did not so much leave the democrats as the democrats left them.The Republicans of the Eisenhower era were not unlike today's conservative Democrats. Indeed, thanks to wedge-politics and the Republicans targeting the bible-bashing white former “dixiecrats” and soulless Mammon-worshipping billionaires of the “screw the poor” faction of the 1%, most Eisenhower type moderate Republicans have now ended up democrats while the Republicans have abandoned the socially-progressive fiscal conservatives to pander to swivel-eyed loons who think the world is flat and Obama is a baby-eating Antichrist married to a man in a dress who somehow birthed two children.The batsh*t crazy a*holes of the KKK no longer feel at home in the democrats because of the massive post 1960s realignment that completely shifted the orientation and constituency of both Republicans and Democrats.

The Republican Party was born as an anti-slavery Party. Southern Democrats detested the party of Lincoln for ending slavery and Reconstruction.After the Slaughterhouse Cases in 1873 gave states the ability to discriminate against blacks, Jim Crow was born. This was the invention of Southern Democrats.The Democratic Party gradually attracted urban, liberal Northerners who joined in an uneasy alliance with conservative Southern Democrats. This alliance began to unravel in 1948 when Truman issued executive orders de-segregating the military and forbidding Federal contractors from racial discrimination. This so enraged Southern Democrats that they formed the “""Dixiecrat Party.” Strom Thurmond ran as the presidential candidate for that party against Truman.The 1950’s brought the Brown v. Board of Ed case ending racial discrimination in public schools. In 1957 and 1960 Congess passed the first legislation designed to destroy Jim Crow. Northern Democrats and many Republicans, including Barry Goldwater voted for these civil rights bills. The landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 ended Jim Crow. Again, Northern Democrats and many Republicans, led by the valiant Everett Dirksen, pushed these bills through. Lyndon Johnson was responsible for these bills, and he knew that Democrats had lost the South by voting for them.Barry Goldwater did not vote for the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

The Democratic Party is no longer the party of the KKK just as, you might say, the Republican Party is no longer the party of Lincoln.During the Reagan runup to election, dog-whistle racism became part of the strategy to appeal to voters, primarily Southern, but not exclusively, disillusioned by the advent of racial diversity in America.We’re seeing the product of that dog-whistle approach in today’s political climate. Republicans have perhaps not courted racist voters, but they have not publicly pushed them away either.Resistance to President Obama from GOP loyalists suggested deeply racist attitudes toward our first black president. One didn’t have to scratch much below the surface to find highly racist memes on social media.But the fact that the KKK was founded as a militant wing after the Civil War is quite telling. Essentially, the percentage of people that are racist in America has not likely changed much. In some ways, it has grown more fierce and fearful of irrelevance, hence the aggressive drive to elect a man like Donald Trump, who similarly embraced support from racist voters and even has known anti-Semitic people hired as his key advisors.We’re actually in the new Civil War. The current budget shows Trump ramping up military spending to win the favor of the Pentagon, and he’s seeking the money to do that by cutting programs that support the poor, feed the hungry, protect the environment, promote the arts and advance civil rights.That’s the clear dividing line. Republicans seem to love the idea, and Stephen Bannon has publicly advocated it, of deconstructing what they brand “the administrative state.” Thus we’re facing a ‘reverse secession’ by an oligarchal attempt to divest people of a government that actually acts in their best interests. They are trying to kill the Union in order to install the Neo-Confederacy of theocracy and trickle-down ethnology.And if you don’t think racism is behind much of this, that is tremendously naive. Wall off the Mexicans. Throw black people in jail. Corporatize the prisons. Eliminate the EPA that prevents polluters from protecting the poor from pollution and environmental degradation.It’s an evil plan, really. But it’s certainly not Democrats that have kept all this going. And the KKK no longer appeals to Democrats for political support. That’s the new history of America.

4,What can be the best way to democratize the truth?,Web Accessibility,Truth,Information,1!,1!,1!,"Apparently none of the authors who have written so far have done a serious reading of the Transcendentalists. If they rather had, then at least they chose not to answer the question carefully. The ‘democratization of truth’ is the consideration of perspectives as though they cast ‘votes’ in order to obtain the most ‘democratic’ truth.Thoreau suggested that the best way to democratize the truth is to escape the pressures of a busy life and practice introspection.Ralph Waldo Emerson thought that the best way to democratize the truth was to reject appeals to authority and analyze the available evidence as best you can.Margaret Fuller was, frankly, angsty and unhelpful in delivering a method for democratizing the truth. Her acts, though, suggested that when a perspective has been lost or forgotten, the best way to go about recovering it is to look for secondhand reports.Walt Whitman wasn’t a very good Transcendentalist in this regard. He focused on being observant ‘within’ one perspective rather than directly adopting others, and he placed a lot of emphasis on the ‘common’, ‘shared’, or ‘anonymous’ qualities of consciousness. Both of those can be useful ways to help democratize the truth, though a close recitation of Whitman’s longer poems is necessary to detail his methods well.The democratization of truth is a hard problem from a computational perspective. The idea of iterating over every concept space and asking each coherent perspective a finite question can be accomplished in finite time if and only if the number of coherent perspectives in that space is also finite and every calculus given by every perspective terminates. Counting arguments under the assumption of Coherentism can be used to argue that the number of coherent perspectives in that space is finite, though it also forces all those perspectives to avoid contradicting a set of prior beliefs which can be thought of as arbitrary in the general case. A graph-theoretic analysis of the concept space under a classical Aristotelian binary logic then shows that the dependence of that approach on Coherentism doesn’t produce ‘democratic’ truth in that some concepts are classically contradictory. A fuzzy (infinitely-many-valued) modal logic of at least the third order is necessary to escape that proof, though it leads necessarily to a very weak Coherentism.It’s more likely that the concept space is infinite in the sense that it will never stop growing, and that the complete democratization of truth is therefore impossible. To that end, a sufficient democratization of truth is defined contextually, such that the conclusion which is obtained by a sufficient method for the democratization of truth is similar to that which would be obtained by consideration of the entire concept space according to a tolerance condition. Presumably, the methods which accomplish this for relatively low tolerances are those which the Transcendentalists took so long to find.",95,3,132,252,0,1

It is a metaphor suggesting that the people being described are members of a military unit marching in a rectangular formation. The ranks are the rows of people marching abreast. The files are the columns of people marching in a line, one following the other.It takes individual discipline and determination of purpose to march in this manner. Anyone who has been in the military or even a drill team or marching band knows how difficult it is to stay in step and formation with a bunch of people while moving. To accomplish this feat, everyone in the unit must stay alert and instantly perform as directed by the person leading the unit. Describing a member of any group as “rank-and-file” implies that they are loyal and trustworthy by nature of being fully committed to the objectives of the group. But, above all, they are obedient to the group’s leadership.Being “rank-and-file” also implies that the person does not have elite status as a leader in the group in that they are “just one of the troop”. In other words, the “rank-and-file” are the foot soldiers, those who stay in line and do as they are told as opposed to the officers, who in olden times would be on horseback and not marching in formation.The metaphor is that thinking and acting in unison with other people, such as being a loyal member of a political party, is conceptually akin to being an obedient foot soldier marching in a military unit.I also want to comment on two things in your question.You correctly used the slash (‘/’) character as an abbreviation for the word “or”. A lot of poorly-educated people mistakenly think it means “and” for some reason, which doesn’t make any sense given how a slash is routinely used in signage to indicate options. (Example: “Entree served with choice of fries/cornbread/tater tots.”) However, because of this common misconception, it would be clearer to explicitly spell out the word “or” or “and” in case that distinction affects the meaning.Gratuitously forcing words that should be capitalized to lower case irks me at least as much as gratuitous capitalization of words that should be lower case. In English, capitalization is not arbitrary. There is a big difference between a “democrat or republican” and a “Democrat or Republican”.A “democrat” is one who believes that political power should be exercised by the people at large.A “republican” is one who believes that the government should be organized as a republic with power wielded by popularly elected officials.A Democrat in the United States is a member of the Democratic Party, one of the two major political parties in this nation.A Republican is a member of the Republican Party, the other major party.",115,1,156,267,0,0

The political opposition during ‘Reconstruction’ was the Democratic Party.Jim Crow eraAfter occupation troops withdrew, local fury at have to treat former slaves as equals resulted in massive oppression of blacks, mostly in former slave states and in some,but not all northern states. This was called segregation - separate schools, pools, water fountains etc for whites and blacks, always inferior for black people.Whites in the south terrorized back people to keep them in their place, similar to the way slave patrols looked for runaway slaves. Whites carried guns. Many blacks were killed.World War TwoThe Democratic Party elected Franklin Roosevelt in 1932, when the economy collapsed. Republicans controlled banking when the crash happened. They lost money and there was no safety net. As Republicans list power, they began to lose control of manners in society, especially in how blacks were kept from opportunity.The Democratic Party, with leadership from Eleanor franklin, pushed hard for equality and integration of blacks and whites everywhere. In response, republicans opposed treating blacks exactky the same as white people.Republicans then went firmly against ‘race mixing’. The Democrats in the south formed a party to promote segregation to stop blacks from using their civil rights.Integration and ‘Segregation Forever!’Ordinary white people were consumed by the horror of mixing with blacks in everyday life. Black and white marrying each other was illeagal.Public schools Closed for a year to prevent white kids sitting in the same room as black kids. when black children were given right to attend formerly white schools Segregation lingers in U.S. schools 60 years after Little RockWhite people refused to allow blacks to sit with whites, saying that blacks were inferior, dirty and other insulting nonsense.Civil rights Movement***The Democratic Party and religious groups mostly from northern USA states started a campaign to give black people more political and civil power.*****The Republican Party fought this in every way. By the time Richard Nixon was president, Republiclicans were appealing to racists for support. Nixon told racists they were the Moral Majority, urging them to vote against any democrats.Because Republicans could not use facts to support keeping black subservient to whites, they started to use emotional arguments that were irrational, false and caused people to hate each other rather than talk to each other.The political division between republicans and democrats was formed then and continues today.Republican Party:Newt Gingrich studied propaganda and developed a propaganda campaign to demonize Democratic Party. people and policiesNewt Gingrich: And His List of WordsFinally, an answer to your question.Racial division began with slavery. The Democrats worked to achieve equal civil rights for everyone of every race. The republicans became the party of segregation, keeping the races apart, hating Democrats and blacks",51,2,86,892,1,2

1,Will making Congressional elections about supporting Trump do more to energize Democratic or Republican voters this November?,Democratic Party (US politics),Republican Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"Clearly at the moment Trump is more energizing to Democrats than to Republicans. The average Republican get up everyday, lives their life and pops into the internet to mock a few libs “because Trump” somewhere in there. Meanwhile the average Democrat appears to have a timer set to remind them to get angry that Trump is president (“relax” mode on the app gives an anguished scream every 12 minutes) and has a Trump voodoo doll by the bed “just in case” that kind of thing works. For all you humorless sticks in the mud rushing to the comments, that’s called a “joke” and doesn’t require rebuttal.So of course the best election issue for Democrats is Trump. The more the election centers on him the bigger their gains - assuming the economy doesn’t swing his approval numbers by then.But there’s a flip side. Because while an election that’s 100% about Trump will be a wave, the more they talk about him the less prominent he will be. Even though Republicans aren’t especially motivated by love for Trump, they are fucking sick and tired of being shit on by progressives. And the more loudly progressives scream the more Republicans will think about the opportunity to waive the middle finger. If Democrats could somehow shut down all political communication of any kind they would be set for 2018. Those timer wielding crazies are voting out no matter what. But those casual republicans… Well, a lot might forget about the whole thing if not reminded incessantly. They might not care if not given a good reason like “fuck the left”. Because there’s not that much on the line to them. But a half hearted anti-liberal vote counts the same as a double hearted anti Trump manifesto. If they come out.I could be totally off base here. It’s just speculation on anecdotal bullshit really. But one night really cemented this in my mind. 6/20/17. That night Karen Handel beat Joel Ossoff by 3.6% in a district Trump won by 1%. You probably heard about this one. Trump’s low margin of victory in the traditionally Republican district led Democrats to invest a lot of capital (both monetary and political) in flipping the seat. But in the intensely contested district it wasn’t to be.Meanwhile, in South Carolina’s 5th district on the same night the GOP got a surprise as Ralph Norman defeated his Democrat opponent (Archie Pernell - from Goldman Sachs!) by a mere 3.1%. In a district Trump dominated by 18 points. Democrats left this one for dead (and it showed with barely a third the turnout of GA 6), but at the end of the day it was actually closer than the test everyone was watching. The 17 point difference in Trump support didn’t matter a bit. Or did it?It’s just two special elections, but it’s a fascinating contrast. Democrats hung their hat on GA6, both in spending and national attention. It attracted 260 thousand voters and the Republican outperformed Trump by a hair. They ignored SC5, which attracted only 87 thousand votes, but the Republican underperformed Trump’s margin by 14 points. It may be just noise, but it’s not crazy to think that the more hyped an election is the worse Democrats do. Here:That looks an awful lot like Republicans are saying “we’ll stay home unless it seems like you might win.” This could all be noise, but I think there’s something here. Not 13 points of course, but it’s not nothing.It sure seems like the optimal Democratic strategy is to do everything in their power to assure we forget about November. But there’s of course zero possibility of that in a major midterm. I predict significant but disappointing gains for Democrats.",889,35,1.4k,940,1,0
1,Will making Congressional elections about supporting Trump do more to energize Democratic or Republican voters this November?,Democratic Party (US politics),Republican Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"I think it depends on whether this election becomes a referendum on Trump’s personal scandals or on Trump’s job performance.If the focus is on scandals, it could very well help Republicans by motivating them to close ranks in the face of a real or perceived witch hunt against Trump. Look at how the anti-Clinton crusade of the 90’s actually ended up bolstering President Clinton’s support by persuading Democrats to stand behind a President that they didn’t always agree with.If the focus is on job performance, however, then that could really bolster the Democrats. Republican support for Trump isn’t weakened by his personal scandals - it’s weakened by his more unpopular policy decisions. The biggest crack right now is the looming threat of Trump creating a trade war with China. If Democrats hammer at that by making the election into a campaign to shackle Trump’s hand (tariff authority ultimately belongs to Congress), that would splinter Republican support as they become torn between supporting their President and not provoking retaliatory tariffs aimed right at their own livelihoods. Focus on the political buzzsaw that the President is voluntarily walking into, and you’ve got a winning strategy.The ball is in the Democrats’ court on this. If they can bottle their moral outrage long enough to see where Trump actually is weakest, then they’ve got it made.

2,"Should Democrats embrace the socially liberal business class to counter President Trump's populist, anti-trade agenda?",Liberalism (politics),Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"That is the Democratic Party.While there are regional exceptions, the DNC is rabidly pro buisness. For more than two decades; what buisness wants, buisness gets. This is the face of Clintonian Democracy.Clintonian Democrats are what could rightly be termed as Hyper Capitalists.This is part of the problem, institutionalized Corporatism. This stance has turned off organized labor and put them in grim views of the working classes.It has however easily secured the College Educated especially in the middle management sectors and all the way through the tech sectors.Keep in mind that Democrats have voted for every tax cut since 88 up until last year. They’ve sided with Republicans on Free Trade and they happily signed off on financial and communications deregulation.Even the great Democratic Socialist, Bernie Sanders has a pretty pro buisness track record, he just favors smaller firms.Banks lobby Democrats just as hard as Republicans, harder since Democrats get elected in cities. Tech companies love Democrats and so do Military Industrial Companies that don’t manufacture small arms for the civilian market and small munitions. Lockheed, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, GD, Raytheon and Hughes all count Democratic lawmakers as hardened allies.Wall Street in general, beyond banks, have come to almost prefer Democrats to Republicans because Democrats don’t get bogged down in regressive social wars and the occasional austerity pledge. That stuff is bad for buisness.No what Democrats need is American Buisness friendly policies. They’ve largely moved away from small buisness to the multinationals as that’s where the donations are at. They aren’t alone, Republicans make a lot of hay out of protecting small buisness but their agenda is just as pro-corporate as the Democrats, moreso because they aren’t fettered by environmental regulations and really still like Tort Reform as a catchphrase.President Trump’s protectionism isn’t Anti-Trade it’s anti outsider. Anything foreign is bad, unless it’s a boutique item. It’s also diametrically opposed to every economic principle in American Conservatism.Essentially Trump has an uphill battle here because his own party will undermine him on this. Unless he manages to completely remake the GOP in his own image which carries much more complex implications.Populism is not Anti Globalism though the Trumpian Wing of the GOP has done a good job of linking the two concepts.Trump is also not a Populist, he has a populist message but very few populist policies. He is selling Oligarchy masked as populism. He has no policies for an alternative living wage, no reverse-income Tax, no large scale jobs inititives. He has yet to execute any entrepreneurship initiatives (something that actually surprises me).He has cut top end taxes. He has cut the corporate rate and he put a sunset clause on everything else. He didn’t do any of this either. This was a Paul Ryan Tax Cut the President just signed it into law.Should President Trump successfully implement sweeping tariffs across multiple sectors, the Democrats won’t need to embrace the Buisness Class, those folks will be knocking on the door to lockdown as many Democrats as possible.The flip side of this is the Progressive Left which has failed to articulate its buisness Policy. The far left voters also sometimes fail to differentiate the difference between Mama’s Pizzaria and Microsoft. That chasm between those two entities is galactic in scale.What Democrats need is a cohesive message and a policy to back it up. Globalism can be a good thing but not if the Net result is a ten percent cheaper product that employs foreign child labor at the expense of American Jobs.Liberals are actually better at rooting out the Globalist Cheats than Republicans and always have been. You can be certain that it was some liberal social justice warrior who popped China for lead paint in kids toys, inhumane animal policies in down feather sourcing, slave labor in conflict diamond mines. Every time the GAP gets popped for some sweatshop infraction it was a prolabor liberal rooting around to make a scene.When Mitt Romney got busted sourcing Olympic uniforms in Myanmar, there was a troublemaking liberal at play.What the Democrats need to actually do is make those occasional scenes into policy and then sell it to the American Public; something they suck at.What they can’t do is wait for some Obama or Bill Clinton to sell their ideas for them. That’s always been their problem, messaging.Well messaging and greed.If the Democrats hadn’t been so greedy they wouldn’t be so compromised.When Citizens United stood a SCOTUS challenge the Republicans cheered. Most did anyway. What no one realized though was how effective the Democrats would be at fundraising using the CU rules. They actually outdid their Republican counterparts quite often, especially when they have minorities in Congress.Citizens United had two effects. It institutionalized corporatism in the Democratic Party and pushed many rural Republicans out on the fringes because they couldn’t compete on monies, they had to out-crazy their opponents.In some ways Citizens United was terrible for the GOP because the party of buisness became the party of bad buisness and dying technologies. Cronyism crept in and that is some pernicious stuff that is incredibly hard to kill off.If if I were the Party boss, which would never happen, I’d institute a couple of changes.I’d take Nancy Pelosi out of the front spot. Pelosi is the greatest fundraiser in Congressional history, she’s a brilliant Parlimentarian and she has earned her seniority.Nancy Pelosi is terrible on a microphone. She is god awful at distilling Policy into easily digestible soundbites and she is a lightning rod the other side can use to hit the Democrats over the head.Pelosi needs to withdraw from potential Speakership. She should run the fundraising committee. She needs to step back and let someone younger be the spokesperson and the face of House Democrats.Ideally this new face will be mid-40s, preferably a veteran but maybe an entrepreneur. Someone who can possibly connect with the untapped voters. It needs to be someone with balls.Duckworth has balls, she wasn’t born with em but she acquired some along the way. The House has some potentials and Pelosi can coach em up on the parliamentary maneuver from behind the scenes but the Democrats have to divorce themselves from the upper crust cocktail party image of out of touch rich people that Pelosi kind of imparts.Thats not fair, but it’s true.Schumer is ok in the Senate but he’s not ideal either. He is Wall Street’s guy on the Hill and that has connotations that don’t help.The entire National Party needs concrete policy outlines. They need to be proactive not reactive.They need to stake out one really important piece of ground. Anything that suppresses voting is malignant. If Republicans want voter ID, push a law that requires one be supplied. Election Day should be a National Holliday. A Constitutional Amendment that creates roughly spherical geographic voting districts should be mentioned in every single press encounter by every single member, candidate and surrogate every single time. Ex Cons should get to vote and voting eligibility should be backed up to include enrolled High School kids at age 16.Kill off Dark Money in politics.Bernie Sanders takes in cash at $5 a pop. He crushed the other candidates. That’s a road map that future Democrats need to follow. Be Angry, Be Honest and Be Loud. Don’t wait for banks and PACs and the Washington politicos, fundraise from your own district and do it in 5 dollar increments. Every dollar that comes in from outside needs to be called out for what it is.

If a person is born into a society where all land is already 100% owned, then they are not free to merely exist without working (since trespassing laws would presumably reign). This is not freedom. The counterargument from libertarians that such an argument could apply to all property is flawed because land is a special type of property that is different from others: it is scarce, necessary for life, and without substitutes. Food and clothing can be grown, water is always accessible (to varying degrees), shelter can be constructed, and medicine may not be needed, but a piss poor individual who starts off with zero land ownership has a snowball’s chance in hell of surviving as an independent entrepreneur.We reject the NAP if applying this principle on a society-wide scale results in consequentially inferior outcomes. In other words, our starting moral principles are consistent so you cannot question the ethics of our subsequent positions without debunking consequentialist ethics first.Libertarians find ways to argue that the market will fix the tragedy of the commons and the free rider problem in every case except defense. If they were consistent, they would advocate for private militaries and police forces as well. In other words, libertarians are just hypocritical anarcho-capitalists.Best arguments from a libertarian:Most everything that can be done through the government violently can be done through the people peacefully via voluntary measures. See: Sankar Srinivasan's answer to How do libertarians propose on how the more vulnerable members of the society be taken care of?Capitalism as it currently exists is crony capitalism, so stop using a strawman to force libertarians to defend an indefensible position. You will never see a libertarian ever support bailouts, subsidies, corporate lobbying, etc. In a libertarian society, companies are successful only because they generate value for customers, and customers in a libertarian society will always have choices.The logical conclusions of libertarian philosophy are minarchism/anarcho-capitalism, which are morally sound when properly realized (see my previous linked answer). On the other hand, the logical conclusion of collectivist progressivism is Orwellian socialism, where free speech, property rights, and even bodily rights (forced blood donations, anyone?) do not exist.

Then I learned that Libertarians truly do not believe in government oversight of anything other than: 1) the printing of currency, 2) protecting our borders, and 3) maintaining our military. That’s it. There is no belief that the government can or should act on our behalf in any way aside from those 3 ways. No environmental protections, no consumer protections, no safety net to help the needy, elderly and infirm (IE: no SS, no Medicare, no Medicaid, no food stamps, no WIC, etc.), no equal rights protections for any special interest group, no Planned Parenthood funding for clinics in underserved communities, no punishing of corporate polluters, no affordable health care, and some would even say no public schools. Nada. They believe the states should take over most of these roles with the federal government being shrunk down to a tiny fraction of its current size.So, one could argue that Libertarianism is in many ways the exact opposite of Social Democrats’ belief that our government exists to serve us. SD’s believe the government should create and enforce consumer and environmental protections, hold corporate polluters accountable and protect the public from those who seek to use their wealth and power to write laws that benefit them at the expense of everyone else (IE: banks attempting to loosen the oversight put in place to protect us from another banking fiasco, or Nestle believing they can privatize public water supplies for their own use despite the public’s reliance on that water supply, etc.). SD’s fully support public education and want equal access to excellent schools and affordable health care for everyone, not just those who can afford fancy private schools or expensive insurance.Libertarians like the Koch Brothers have spent their lives and a good portion of their personal fortunes trying to undermine every aspect of our social safety net, undo the ACA, and get rid of regulations they feel are too costly and unnecessary (despite the fact that these regulations were written by Congress to address specific complaints or problems such as unsafe working conditions, or the poisoning of air and ground water around coal mines, etc.)So, those who see and are upset by the amount of racism and inequality we still have in banking, housing, educational and occupational opportunities, health care outcomes, etc. and believe we need the government to stand up for the powerless would be Social Democrats.

0,What are your thoughts on this NBC article on how the Democrats can win back Washington D.C.?,Media Bias,Bias,Political Conservatism,1!,1!,1!,"A few thoughts, both about the article and the problems it discussed. First, it is unfortunate that gerrymandering exists, such that the party in power can create districts that favor its candidates and marginalize political opponents. It’s also unfortunate that the Supreme Court decided Citizens United, such that “dark money” is able to influence even local politics, and that the Justices also gutted key portions of the Voting Rights Act. And finally, it’s unfortunate that Democrats were not as motivated or passionate in the 2010 elections, such that the Republicans were able to take excellent advantage of the aforementioned factors.But, sad to say, all these factors do exist and Democrats need to find ways to turn things around. I do not believe the elections are “rigged” per se, but I do believe the current system can be manipulated by special interest groups like the Koch Brothers, or by political operatives who know how to put up obstacles for people who want to vote (the “voter ID” laws, enabled by the myth of rampant voter fraud is a good example). Millions of Americans don’t or can’t vote, and that keeps those in power feeling as if they are untouchable. Also a factor is the role of partisan media like the commentators at Breitbart and Fox News, who continue to fan the flames of resentment, and spread misinformation (or disinformation) about immigrants, Muslims, Democrats, etc.Men like Don Blankenship (or for that matter Donald Trump) have tried to capitalize on the anger and frustration felt by many low-information white voters. But until the Democratic base unites to demand change, I don’t know if things will improve. There needs to be re-examination of “dark money,” and the public deserves to know who is behind the anonymous attack ads that dominate the airwaves. We as Americans need to make voting a right, rather than a privilege. There is NO “rampant voter fraud” and the disenfranchisement of eligible voters (including ex-convicts who have paid their debt to society) is shameful. The current system rewards the wealthy and the powerful and devalues the needs of average working people. I see no sign this will change unless there is political will, and unless Democrats retake at least the House of Representatives in November.",87,2,590,"1,241",0,0

This completely misses the whole reason the House exists, which is to give the voters of a geographic area a direct representitve in the federal government.

Most of which were conservative, Republican plans that the current Rs abandoned, as soon as effective Democratic leadership was successful in passing. That sort of Demagoguery, the lack of identified issues or plan to deal with them is frightening.ACA, a Republican proposal, while it’s goal was to insure more people, also had the primary goal of making medical care your personal responsibility, rather than forcing hospitals to pick up the tab for the uninsured as well as bankrupting the unprepared.

The tax bill will help him as long as nobody cares about deficits. He seems to be too scared to pull the plug on NAFTA and China, these will hurt him. But the fact that he is so gung ho on foreign wars is a real soft spot. “America First” meant, don’t spend our money fighting other people’s wars, bring it home!The problem with the democrats is that they are 100% in the pocket of the Israeli lobby! The middle east is a fragmented, contentious place where only dictators or kings survive. Israel is right in the middle of the middle east and is thus always drawn into sectarian conflict. Thus Israel always wants us to fight their wars for them. Iran doesn't like Israel, but isn’t doing anything against them, Israel detests Iran in return. Israel is 6mm people Iran is 81mm people.

If it were a country, it would be, by population and economy, one of the largest nations in Europe.At one level, then, California is not a “one party state.” There are pockets here and there that are quite “red.” The northern and alpine parts of the state near Nevada, for example. Some of the suburban areas between Los Angeles and San Diego (though “Orange County” is often thought of as very Republican, it is in fact, pretty purple with enclaves of Republicans mixed in with very Democratic ones) remain solidly Republican.But for any office or vote where statewide totals rule (like deciding senate or governor’s races, or the presidential electoral vote), in fact, California is already a one-party state, and has been for more than a few years.In the last senate election, for example, the two finalists on the ballot, Kamala Harris and Loretta Sanchez, were both liberal Democrats. (As an aside, Sanchez had been the House rep for the district I used to live in in the allegedly ‘red’ Orange County seat held for years by the ultra right-wing “B-1” Bob Dornan). This year, it is very likely that incumbent senator Dianne Feinstein, a moderate Democrat, will face a challenge from the left on the final ballot, in another all-Democratic finale.The current slate of state offices from governor to insurance commissioner is entirely Democrats.This week, the California GOP held its convention to decide which of the (sure loser) candidates to back in the coming governor’s race to replace the iconic Jerry Brown (another Democrat). It was an event described by our local newspaper (The San Francisco Chronicle) as a test of whether the GOP ultimately will even survive in California, where only 25% of registered voters are Republicans.I suspect that California may find itself in 20 years looking a lot like San Francisco, where the Republicans are a bit like an albino alligator. They offer no serious opposition to a city where the debates are between the far-left and the moderate left. Our former mayor, Willie Brown, who was for years Public Enemy Number One of the California GOP was actually attacked in his last year as some sort of Republican stooge because he was insufficiently liberal.Who knows what the state will look like in 50 or even 25 years? San Francisco in 1964 elected its first Democratic mayor five decades. It has not had a single Republican since.But as of now, the state is, functionally, a one party state and is likely to see the power of the Democratic party increase.",66,0,260,"1,757",0,0
2,Is California becoming a one-party (Democrat) state?,California (state),Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"Yes but then most states are becoming one party states, unfortunately. Year after year the number of states that are competitive seems to shrink, with I think dangerous implications for the stability of the Republic. It wasn’t always like this; as recently as the 1970’s, Idaho had a liberal Democrat (Frank Church) as a senator and New York had James L. Buckley, a guy too conservative to even be a Republican. The problem seems to be that the GOP has turned hard right and discharged all of its moderate (much less liberal) members. While the Democrats have also gradually become more liberal (mostly by losing conservative whites to the GOP) the change isn’t nearly as profound. This super polarization is dangerous because of the Federal system; if it continues, the Senate and the electoral college will only become more profoundly undemocratic. My hope is that the elections of Scott Brown and Doug Jones aren’t flukes and that states will become more competitive.ADDENDUM: Scott Brown is a tool.

2,Why did the Democrat NY AG Eric Schneiderman resign before due process? Isn’t he innocent until proven guilty?,NY Attorney General Eric Schneiderman Resigns After Assault Allegations (May 2018),Innocence,Guilt,Democratic Party (US politics),Psychology,Law,"A fair question.I sort of defended Schneiderman when the reports first appeared. I was upset when people like Governor Cuomo and Senator Gillibrand called for his resignation within a couple of hours of the initial report being published. I’ve been attacked online by people for saying that I don’t think “resign, then investigate” is the right answer and that he deserved (colloquially) due process. My position is and was that he should recuse himself from day to day operations in the Department of Law and that an investigation to determine the credibility of the charges should happen immediately. That takes the accusers seriously and protects the accused.All that changed when he resigned. As far as I’m concerned, that was an admission of guilt. Nobody took anything from him. He chose to resign. Due process, in the legal sense, doesn’t apply here. It will apply if the investigation which is apparently going to happen ends up with him going to court as a defendant based on the accusations.We tend to use legal phrases in non-legal contexts on a fairly regular basis. “Due process” and “innocent until proven guilty” are two of the most common. But we, as citizens, are not really bound by either. You’re free to believe that OJ really did it even though he was not convicted of murder. Personally, I found the accusations against Schneiderman believable. The important question is, what happens next? In court, there are fairly bright lines defining things like “due process” and “innocent until proven guilty”. In the court of public opinion, there are no bright lines at all. What happens there is often not “fair”, but there’s simply no way to make it so, or in many cases to even agree on what “fair” is.And there are reasonable arguments that what happened with other government officials practically immediately calling for his resignation was a violation of the colloquial principles of “due process” and “innocent until proven guilty”, they were not legally violations of Scheiderman’s rights. And I emphasize that I am not saying that Scheiderman should have been able to stay in office unless and until a conviction in court was reached. There’s a lot of room between that and “resign hours after the first published report”. I’m not sure where exactly in that gray area I’d draw the line, but I know that I consider one of those endpoints too high a bar and the other too low.I find the whole business to be a very dangerous game. I wonder, for example, whether Senator Gillibrand, whom I like in many ways and voted for in her last election, has considered the precedent that her actions in the Franken and Schneiderman cases has set. Having come out strongly for instant “justice”, what would she do if a group of MRA or “incel” types fabricated a plausible sounding accusation against her and distributed it through a friendly right-wing media source and demanded her immediate resignation? On what basis would she be able to refuse?Let me be absolutely clear on this: accusations like the ones made against Schneiderman, like the ones made against Roy Moore, like the ones made against Harvey Weinstein, like the ones made against Donald Trump, absolutely should be taken seriously. They should be given fair evaluation and, if found credible, pursued. But for justice to be done both the accuser(s) and the accused must be protected from the mob acting emotionally.The mob is difficult to rouse, but once roused even more difficult to control.",460,6,543,"4,379",0,0

He has been outspoken about violence against women, centered around the Harvey Weinstein case. The suggestion that he is guilty of the very same conduct that he was prosecuting would make it challenging, to say the least, for him to continue in his role as AG.Thus….resignation.PSMusings on the New Yorker piece that prompted his resignation:While I’m no great fan of the AG, and condemn abuse of and violence against women, I’m puzzled at the particulars of this case. Most especially, I have trouble understanding how these successful, independent, and well connected women stayed in ongoing relationships with him despite what they knew to be his predilection to abuse and violence.I fully well understand how women in certain relationships, where they are dependent or subordinate, might feel pressured or scared or coerced into continuing an abusive relationship. But that doesn’t seem to apply here.To be clear, again, I don’t excuse his behavior, and think he was right to resign, yet wonder aloud at the motivation of the women who freely continued to associate intimately with him.",599,7,5k,"1,814",0,0

When you’re a significant public figure, that’s even moreso the case.Is it wrong? Yup. Does that stop people from jumping up and down on a person’s reputation, self-esteem, career and life decisions before any judicial decision is made? Nope.Chances are he resigned because a) he didn’t want to have to try and do his job while under suspicions of misconduct, b) because not doing so would mean his family would have to go through watching him deal with the accusations, and c) because the public need to feel they can trust those in power, and he likely felt those accusations undermined his ability to do so.Yes, it’s possible he’s guilty, and resigned out of embarrassment, but it’s also equally possible that he’s done nothing wrong. Either way, he’s considered tainted goods by the general public as a consequence - and we don’t know the truth either way.What I want to know next is whether those accusations will be followed through, with evidence and a trial, or whether this is one of those moments where the accusation was made, the verdict rendered by the court of public opinion, and not a damn thing actually happens afterwards.",1.7k,32,1.4k,"1,931",0,0

6,Why have the Republican and the Democratic party switched sides regarding ideology? When did this change happen?,Democratic Party vs. Republican Party,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"It’s more of a rotation than a “switch” or “flip.”Or more like vortex than a rotation, with slow-rotating core interests, and fast-rotating electoral and wedge issues. (1) Parties are built on serious coalitions of insiders with specific interests and goals that change very slowly, and then they (2) seek to get as many votes as they can, and how they approach this changes faster. Eg for Republicans fighting same-sex marriage was claimed to be vitally important when 51% of the population was against it, than suddenly wasn’t important when it started costing votes, rotating the fast-moving part of the spiral — but Wall Street interests are unwavering.So the Republicans have been the party of business owners for a *LONG* time. Though long enough ago they were generally the urban party instead of the rural. And less long ago they were the party of college graduates and it wasn’t clear who supported civil rights. The social issues are the fast-rotating part of the spiral: the Republican money’ed core doesn’t care particularly about abortion or gun control — those are for election time — but about taxes and resources — those are for governing. Eventually, especially in modern politics, those non-core voters start to influence the primaries and eventually, slowly, influence the central core of the party. Trump engineered quite a feat here, and maybe have shifted the Republicans seriously (or not, too early to be sure.)Specific History:The Republican Party was founded to represent modern corporations, owners and workers in the North and centered on the corporations and stocks, as opposed to the rural interests.At least until very, very recently, the first part of this has always been true, Republicans represent corporate interests. And the rural interests don’t exist today the same way they did back then, with giant farms owned by individuals as one of the wealthiest parts of the economy. The world has changed a lot since before the Civil War. In the beginning, one party to some extent represented both the owners of factories and the workers. Pretty weird to think of it that way, but Republican policies helped New England’s businesses thrive rather than focus on the cotton fields, so the GOP was favored by both the owners and workers.Over time, the parties didn’t exactly “flip.” The core of the GOP was always basically what we now call Wall Street, the owners of the corporations. In the beginning, the coalition included the workers at those (much smaller) corporations. The non-elites voting for the GOP started as workers and abolitionists (what do we call then now, social justice advocates?), the workers switched to the Democrats by the time of FDR, the social justice advocates over the following decades, and at the same time business professionals who would mostly have joined parties based on region concentrated in the Republican Party for a while, and since Clinton have been switching over to the Democrats. This isn’t a flip, but a swirl, often a couple times: but always with a steady center.It’s not a “flip.” It’s more a vortex as non-elites and social issues circle around, but Wall Street and trade deals that benefit corporations (so, protectionism when the US was weak, and free trade when we’re strong) has always been at the center of the GOP. The Culture Wars in the 1960s definitely created a big change, often at a bit of a delay since loyalties were deep … it was the “Reagan Democrats” who had been liberal and became conservative: but here again, this wasn’t the core of the parties flipping from left to right, but rather a large chunk of the white working class flipping. And as the professional classes and even businesses became more liberal and/or turned off by the Culture Wars, they stopped being so consistently Republican. You have to go back from before the 1960s, before the 1930s at least, for the Democrats not to be on the left and the Republicans on the right on most issues (though not as cleanly sorted as in the last couple highly partisan decades.)",84,2,131,834,0,0

You may recall LBJ famous words caught on the mic.The Democrat’s pandering is so obvious. The use words like diversity (the universal “virtue signaling” word) to signal their so-called virtue, telling everyone how tolerant, open and compassionate they are, and not racists. As you can see, they’re just the opposite. When one of their minions wonders off the plantation they harass them, call them Uncle Toms, and even threaten them. It takes a lot of courage for a black to become an individual. It’s how they view conservative and educated blacks as well.Black families have suffered terribly since they took over the black vote, for what reason they keep voting for them no one knows. There’s going to be a big backlash and we can see it starting with younger people like Kayne West and Candace Owens.It works both ways with the Democrats, as well. Obama is a racist and hates white people. He came from a broken home where neither his mother or his father wanted him and has resented it all his life. Being educated in Indonesia in his young impressionable years years didn’t help either.For a more detailed explanation and the reason why Democrats are they way they are read “Black rednecks and White Liberals” by Dr. Thomas Sowell. He explains the history of blacks in this country vs. blacks who came from the West Indies after they were freed, as example. Basically it’s all about attitude not color.Democrats also have been corrupt since their beginning. They broke up the mob only to become the mob. Whenever they’re in power there’s corruption. Just look a the Obama dictatorship for 8 years and you’ll find tyranny by the IRS, spying without proper warrens, obtaining phone numbers of reporters illegally.Thank God our house in Washington DC is getting cleaned up with the end of the Clinton Machine” (mob) as they were known in Arkansas and the criminals are being exposed.Don’t doubt for a minute that many of the republican (RINO’S) are just as corrupt.

6,Why have the Republican and the Democratic party switched sides regarding ideology? When did this change happen?,Democratic Party vs. Republican Party,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"The two World Wars had a lot to do with the gradual sea change between the two main parties, as the Democrats became less rural and more urban. Under Pres. Woodrow Wilson, the Democrats became more global while the GOP became more isolationist with the passing of Theodore Roosevelt. Also, if you look at the two parties’ positions on race and immigration between 1928 and 1968, you had a growing disaffection among some rural Democrats who supported progressive reform but did not want to share the benefits with different ethnic groups.This explains why you had mass defections of conservative Democrats in elections like 1928 (opposing a Catholic POTUS nominee) 1948 (opposing the Fair Deal and anti-lynching) and of course, 1968 (Nixon’s Southern Strategy). We still see these fitful waves of backlash during the Reagan years (Reagan Democrats) and more recently, the Trump campaign, which billed itself as populist even though its leader is anything but a man of the people.Like those who supported the 1924 National Origins Acts, the current Trump-controlled GOP openly discriminates against immigration (even legal immigrants) unless they are Western European or they are politically useful to them. Today, party alignment seems to depend on whether you are willing to share the benefits of the American Dream and accept the changing face(s) of the United States.

When did this change happen?,Democratic Party vs. Republican Party,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Question: “Why have the Republican and the Democratic party switched sides regarding ideology? When did this change happen?”The realignment had been coming for a while. The two parties had always been mixed but was dominated by one faction or the other. The Democratic party was conservative in the 1800s and early to mid 1900s. The Republican party started out as relatively liberal.In 1948 the Southern conservatives left the Democratic party to start the Dixiecrat party. That effort failed and they reluctantly rejoined the Democrats. However the would would not heal.By 1964 the conservatives were still itching to leave the Democratic party. When Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act (most conservatives voted “no”) they couldn’t take it anymore. They voted for Barry Goldwater in the election. Goldwater lost.Richard Nixon saw his opportunity and developed his now infamous “Southern Strategy” to woo conservatives away from the Democratic party and into the Republican party. This succeeded and Nixon won the 1968 election. Conservative politicians joined in the migration as liberal politicians moved to the Democratic party.Ever since then the Republicans have been becoming more and more right-wing and is now considered an extremist, obstructionist, party.Realigning election - WikipediaSouthern strategy - WikipediaDixiecrat - WikipediaUnited States presidential election, 1964 - WikipediaPolitics of the Southern United States - Wikipedia",93,8,815,"5,080",0,5

That is a myth Democrats tell themselves so they can ignore their party’s ugly racist past and still manage to sleep at night.Thr Republican Party fought a war with the Democrat Party when the Democrats became so afraid we were going to take their slaves the seceded from the union. After winning that war, at the cost of hundreds of thousands of lives, we passed the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments recognizing freedom, citizenship, and voting rights for blacks. We also passed the anti-klan Enforcement Acts, and the first civil rights acts, such as the 1875 Civil Rights bill that we passed almost a century before the 1964 Civil Rights Act it inspired.Our positions on ending slavery, recognizing blacks as citizens, recognizing their right to vote, and recognizing their civil rights have NEVER changed, in the entire HISTORY of our party. The Democratic party was FINALLY forced to change on every single one of those issues, but our party NEVER HAS.Here is the basic text of the first three paragraphs of the first Republican Party platform in 1856.“Republican Party Platform of 1856June 18, 1856This Convention of Delegates, assembled in pursuance of a call addressed to the people of the United States, without regard to past political differences or divisions, who are opposed to the repeal of the Missouri Compromise; to the policy of the present Administration; to the extension of Slavery into Free Territory; in favor of the admission of Kansas as a Free State; of restoring the action of the Federal Government to the principles of Washington and Jefferson; and for the purpose of presenting candidates for the offices of President and Vice-President, doResolved: That the maintenance of the principles promulgated in the Declaration of Independence, and embodied in the Federal Constitution are essential to the preservation of our Republican institutions, and that the Federal Constitution, the rights of the States, and the union of the States, must and shall be preserved.Resolved: That, with our Republican fathers, we hold it to be a self-evident truth, that all men are endowed with the inalienable right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and that the primary object and ulterior design of our Federal Government were to secure these rights to all persons under its exclusive jurisdiction; that, as our Republican fathers, when they had abolished Slavery in all our National Territory, ordained that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law, it becomes our duty to maintain this provision of the Constitution against all attempts to violate it for the purpose of establishing Slavery in the Territories of the United States by positive legislation, prohibiting its existence or extension therein. That we deny the authority of Congress, of a Territorial Legislation, of any individual, or association of individuals, to give legal existence to Slavery in any Territory of the United States, while the present Constitution shall be maintained.”Also - Here is the basic text of the Civil Right Acts of 1866, 1870, 1871, and 1875, and other major Civil Rights bills backed by Republicans up to and including the Civil Rights Act in 1964.Again, please feel free to show me where Republicans have ever wavered on ANY of these principles:http://www.arch.ksu.edu/jwkplan/...Here are the three Reconstruction Era Constitutional Amendments, #’s 13, 14, and 15, passed by Republicans with little or no support from Democrats, which recognized freedom, citizenship, and voting rights for blacks.Reconstruction Amendments - WikipediaHere is information on the three “Enforcement Acts” passed by Republicans in 1870 and 1871 which were “criminal codes which protected African-Americans’ right to vote, to hold office, to serve on juries, and receive equal protection of laws”Enforcement Acts - WikipediaOne of those acts was the Ku Klux Klan Act, which authorized the use of FORCE to suppress the Klan:Ku Klux Act passed by Congress - Apr 20, 1871 - HISTORY.comHere is the text of the Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill which was defeated by Southern Democrats in 1918:""Anti-Lynching Bill,"" 1918The US Senate passed a formal apology to the country in 2005 for its failure to enact the bill when it was needed the most.Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill - WikipediaHere is the text of the Civil Rights Act of 1957, which was designed to protect voting rights for blacks.

The parties at one point were very split, pro-slavery Democrats and anti-slavery Republicans. Then over the years there were some interesting changes as society “evolved”, and we had conservative Democrats who were racists, conservative Republicans who were not. We had man moderates in the middle of the political spectrum and we had liberal Democrats and liberal Republicans, both which had their issues but both were generally less racist than the conservative Democrats but more racist than the conservative Republicans. Since about 1970 the liberals have migrated to the Democrat party, the conservatives to the Republican party, however they put away their democrat party racism, and the moderates got wiped out by and large. They were in the middle of the road and got run over.Currently there are very few elected moderates on the national stage. Racism is down significantly, along we still see vestiges lingering with a small hand full of far-right Republicans, and also with a rather significant number of extremist far-left liberal Democrats.So the parties are in some ways really where they were 150 years ago, anti-racism Republicans and pro-racism (quotas, set asides, preferences, BLM, etc.) Democrats.

All in all, however, the party of the right (Federalists, Whigs, and Republicans) has been the more conservative of the two, consistently espousing nationalist and pro-business attitudes that favor the era’s in-groups. The party of the left (Democrats) has been the more liberal of the two, consistently espousing democratizing and pro-commons attitudes that favor the era’s out-groups.

Republicans have long stood against slavery. The first black Senator was a Republican in 1870. His name was Hiram Revels.Democrats in southern states are the author of Jim Crow laws and Segregation. Democrats in congress were the party that kept Jim Crow alive and allowed slavery to continue until Lincoln’s [a Republican] Emancipation Proclamation. Lincoln was assassinated by a southern man that held strong views against setting slaves free. John Wilkes Booth was an actor and a Democrat, upset about freeing the slaves.From a simple search “John Wilkes Booth summary: John Wilkes Booth, a well-known actor, was a staunch supporter of slavery and the Southern Confederacy during America’s Civil War. On the night of April 14, 1865, he entered Ford’s Theater in Washington, D.C., and assassinated Abraham Lincoln, 16th president of the United States.”And I believe that John F Kennedy was assassinated because he was working on passing what became the Civil Rights Bill or 1964. When LB Johnson, became president he continued JFK’s wishes to pass into law to disband Jim Crow laws. Democrats from southern states did not vote for this law. Republicans voted for it in enough numbers for it to pass. For proof of that you only need to look up the 1964 Civil Rights act and look at the voting record.So with that history, so later when black Civil Rights leaders became Democrats they had to explain the history of the Democrat party, so they told black voters, that somehow the parties has switched. There is no evidence at all to support that the parties switched. With the Black population liberated, they had to some how get them to now vote Democrat. President LB Johnson counted on the Civil Rights act to keep them voting Democrat for a long time. So some Democrats began to support the black population and worked to change history.Democrats have been promising help for poor blacks, but nothing every happened. More welfare, more give away, but never a status as proud American for black voters. Which is to have jobs for those who could not get jobs.

7,Is the Democratic Party a viable home for conservatives who reject Trumpism?,Political Conservatism,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"I’m going to say that it’s the least-bad option available to my sort of conservative in today’s political climate. The good part is that the Democrats don’t have nearly the same white supremacy baggage as the GOP do, but the downside is that they’re more or less chasing the same sort of donor money (which comes with all the same conflicts of interest and disservice to their constituents) and just like the GOP, its higher-ups are aware that they’re half of a duopoly and they’re in a position to take advantage of that.For context, I’m one of those ‘you mind your business, I’ll mind my own’ conservatives when it comes to social matters, and I take seriously the idea that the construction of rights in our republic is fundamentally about limiting the powerful from infringing on those who aren’t. For example, free speech protects unpopular speech (popular speech doesn’t need protection), Religious liberty protects minority sects (majority sects need no protection), et cetera. These were established the way they were then, because that’s the kind of problem this republic was intended to solve.Yes, I understand- these days, this ‘look out for the little guy’ is supposedly a leftist/democrat position to take. But remember this! These were the arguments the GOP used to make, when it was run by people who still believed in the norms and traditions of a Liberal republic.The GOP has been captured by powerful interests who know their agenda would never fly in a functional democracy. So, they’ve taken to dog-whistling, to straight-up lying, embracing ‘alternative facts’, and turning politics into a spending contest in order to overcome the fact that it’s a Republic, and voters’ votes still technically matter.Unfortunately, to survive, the Democrats have followed suit. They court the same donor money, they embrace the same economic (if not social) ideas, and they’re willing to throw what voters want under the bus in the name of short-term political expediency.Trying to participate in Democratic politics has been maddening and frustrating for me. I was very enthusiastic about Bernie Sanders’ candidacy, which offered up a renewal of the New Deal, but was frustrated to see the DNC establishment attack him from the right with arguments taken straight out of the GOP playbook.It looks a lot to me like the DNC is doing to progressives what the GOP did to me. The gaslighting, the personal attacks, the taking-your-support-for-granted, the lesser-evilism[1], the ‘that policy most voters want can’t win’ talk (hey, if everyone who wanted that voted for it, it would win). The problem over there isn’t that most people want what they want politically, it’s that their management and high-ups have no incentive to fight for it (and all the donor-incentives to not rock the boat).The reality is that most voters in the USA want largely the same things (I fall into most of these, and most folks I know do as well)[2] (yes, Americans really are ideologically united, but deeply divided in partisan terms- so it’s not like the problem here is inability to find common ground regarding what we want in policy terms- it’s that our teams hate each other enough to fumble the ball into mendacious hands):The figures cited below come from surveys conducted by Gallup, Pew, and other reputable polling organizations on the key issues facing the nation.

(A survey of registered voters found that 54 percent favored a $15 minimum wage.)63 percent of registered voters think the minimum wage should be adjusted each year by the rate of inflation.Workers’ Rights61 percent of Americans—including 42 percent of Republicans—approve of labor unions.74 percent of registered voters—including 71 percent of Republicans—support requiring employers to offer paid parental and medical leave.78 percent of likely voters favor establishing a national fund that offers all workers 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave.Health Care60 percent of Americans believe “it is the federal government’s responsibility to make sure all Americans have healthcare coverage.”60 percent of registered voters favor “expanding Medicare to provide health insurance to every American.”58 percent of the public favors replacing Obamacare with “a federally funded healthcare program providing insurance for all Americans.”64 percent of registered voters favor their state accepting the Obamacare plan for expanding Medicaid in their state.Education63 percent of registered voters—including 47 percent of Republicans—of Americans favor making four-year public colleges and universities tuition-free.59 percent of Americans favor free early-childhood education.Climate Change and the Environment76 percent of voters are “very concerned” or “somewhat concerned” about climate change.68 percent of voters think it is possible to protect the environment and protect jobs.72 percent of voters think it is a “bad idea” to cut funding for scientific research on the environment and climate change.59 percent of voters say more needs to be done to address climate change.Gun Safety84 percent of Americans support requiring background checks for all gun buyers.77 percent of gun owners support requiring background checks for all gun buyers.Criminal Justice57 percent of Americans believe police officers generally treat blacks and other minorities differently than they treat whites.60 percent of Americans believe the recent killings of black men by police are part of a broader pattern of how police treat black Americans (compared with 39 percent who believe they are isolated incidents).Immigration68 percent of Americans—including 48 percent of Republicans—believe the country’s openness to people from around the world “is essential to who we are as a nation.” Just 29 percent say that “if America is too open to people from all over the world, we risk losing our identity as a nation.”65 percent of Americans—including 42 percent of Republicans—say immigrants strengthen the country “because of their hard work and talents.” Just 26 percent say immigrants are a burden “because they take our jobs, housing and health care.”64 percent of Americans think an increasing number of people from different races, ethnic groups, and nationalities makes the country a better place to live. Only 5 percent say it makes the United States a worse place to live, and 29 percent say it makes no difference.76 percent of registered voters—including 69 percent of Republicans—support allowing undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children (Dreamers) to stay in the country. 58 percent think Dreamers should be allowed to stay and become citizens if they meet certain requirements. Another 18 percent think they should be allowed to stay and become legal residents, but not citizens.

So they do what they can to capture the money, and spin it like it’s not betraying the voters even when it amounts to not doing what voters want. In this regard, the Democrats aren’t looking like a viable home for conservatives like me. There’s too much doublespeak in play, even if it’s not at the same level we’re seeing in the GOP.For now, I’m down to Boycott the Republican Party until I can see any better options. I’ll use the Democrats to do that, as best I can. But the moment I have the opportunity to vote on any of those issues above (that most people want) I’ll vote that way.I’m not exactly confident the Democrats will get their shit together quickly enough to do that. The party will do its best to sabotage progressives candidates, and progressives will punish the party by staying home. It will re-run 2016 again and again, trying to heave an aging neoliberal boomer over the bar against the will of its base.This, in turn, will enable the Trump wing of the GOP to sell the republic down the river so hard that it collapses into some simulacrum of the current oligarchy model in modern Russia. And the remaining Democrats will vote for that, too when the time comes, thinking it’s the ‘lesser evil’.

7,Is the Democratic Party a viable home for conservatives who reject Trumpism?,Political Conservatism,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"Maybe. It’s too soon to tell.The thing is, the Democratic party is not intrinsically the party of liberalism or of liberals. It happens to be at the moment, but that’s largely by coincidence rather than by any design. In years past, liberals have felt more at home with the Republicans, and at other times both parties have been more or less equally appealing to liberals and conservatives, with people affining to one or the other for reasons other than their alignment on this particular psychopolitical dimension.At the moment, liberals are far more likely to identify as Democrats than as Republicans because Democratic policy is more consistent with liberal values than is Republican policy. However, party policies can and do change. There are a lot of non-liberal people in the Democratic Party, and quite a few liberals in the Republican Party. It’s a category error to equate Democrats with liberals, just as it is a category error to equate conservatives with Republicans.The Democrats, rather than being the “official party of liberalism”, are the populist party. The fact that Congressional elections are single-member districts elected by pluralities (except in Louisiana, where they’re elected by majorities) pretty much inexorably leads to there being two major political parties, a majoritarian party, which has been, since about 1930, the Democratic Party, and an opposition party, which has been, also since about 1930, the Republican Party. Prior to 1930 the Republican Party was arguably the majoritarian party, with the opposition party being a loose alliance of farmer’s rights and labor rights parties.Perhaps the clearest demonstration of how the Democrats have not always been the party of liberalism is in the push to ratify the Eighteenth Amendment, which culminated in 1920, during the height of the Progressive era. The Eighteenth Amendment is about as anti-liberal as you can get, and the temperance movement in general is a conservative movement. It is, in fact, exactly the sort of law that conservatives typically want. In 1920, Democrats in the North opposed Prohibition, while Republicans favored it. In the South, however, this was reversed: Democrats supported Prohibition while Republicans opposed it.The single fixed star in the Democratic platform has always been worker’s rights. The Democrats have always been a worker’s rights party, ever since the start of industrialization in the early 1800s. Andrew Jackson, for all intents the founder of the Democratic Party, was a populist who earned many epithets indeed, but none of them would ever have been “liberal”. He won his first election on the strength of his public popularity as a war general, with little understand of what, if anything, he stood for. His reelect was secured by a tariff which the North hated but the South loved. (Democrats, for most of their history, have generally been more favorable to protectionist trade policies than Republicans. It is only since the 1980s that Democrats have become a free trade party, about which see more below.) The reason why the Democratic Party tends to be a worker’s rights party is astonishingly simple: there are simply far more workers than there are business owners. Originally, of course, workers generally didn’t get the right to vote (since only landowners could vote), but once workers got the right to vote (around 1820, go figure), the interests of the far-more-numerous working class became increasingly prominent in American politics, especially as the US became increasingly industrialized.The Republican Party lacks a singular fixed star. Up until the 1980s, I would have identified “mercantilism” as its primary guiding principle, as Republicans fairly consistently, from their founding in 1860, have acted to support the interest of businesses against the interests of workers (which, as I’ve noted, are the core Democratic constituency). But since the Reagan Revolution, the Republicans have been much less steadfast in their support of businesses, and have increasingly focused instead on an issue profile that focuses on a “moral values” platform than its historical focus on maximizing commercial opportunity for the owner of capital, resulting in many pro-business Republicans, who have no particular care for—and often antipathy toward—the Republican “family values” platform, or any of the other assorted values of the Republican Party, vacating the party for the Democrats: indeed, it is this wing of the Party that gave us Hillary Clinton (who was, as you may recall, a Republican in her youth).Political historians disagree as to when the Fifth Party System (which took effect in the 1930s) ended, but most agree that it’s dead now. The Fifth Party System featured an alignment which placed liberals and conservatives in both parties: there were liberal Republicans and liberal Democrats, as well as conservative Democrats and conservative Republicans, more or less evenly distributed. This is clearly not the case for the Sixth Party System.But here’s the thing: it’s absolutely certain that the Sixth Party System (or the Fifth, if you’re one of the minority that believes that we’re still in the Fifth) is on its way out. The election of Donald Trump and the rise of Trumpism saw to that. A realignment is in process. The Seventh Party System is in the process of being organized. My expectation is that the Democratic Party is going to cease to be the worker’s rights party. That’s because the Democratic Party, which has been invaded by mercantilists since the Reagan Revolution, is internally quite hostile to worker’s rights. The candidacy of Bernie Sanders, and the quite atrocious reaction to it by Democratic Party stalwarts, is all the proof one needs to see that. I fully expect to see, in the next few years, a “Democratic Socialist” party split out of the Democratic Party, which will leave a rump Democratic Party that will be indeed quite friendly to non-Trumpist Republicans, and to the myriad Republicans who are only pro-life because of the alliance forged in 1980 between pro-life Republicans and pro-business Republicans. (George Bush was pro-choice before he accepted Ronald Reagan’s nomination to be Vice President. His father, Prescott Bush, also a Republican, was an early supporter of Planned Parenthood.)This will, however, leave the United States with three major political parties: the mercantilist New Democrats, the “post-labor” Democratic Socialists, and the nativist/populist Trumpists. (I’m expecting that the Democratic Socialists will be categorically pro-choice, while the New Democrats and the Trumpists will be neutral on this position and thus will both have significant pro-life components.) If there’s one thing we can be sure of about US politics, it’s that having three major parties is an unstable configuration. I lack sufficient insight to predict which way this three-way cookie crumbles.But, to weakly answer the original question after all this discursive rambling, will non-Trumpist Republicans be welcome in the Democratic Party? Maybe. One of the things that takes place during a realignment is that the definitions of the parties themselves are reconsidered. Everyone is currently rethinking what it means to be a Democrat or a Republican. Until a consensus emerges, there’s no way to tell whether people like Richard Painter, Lindsey Graham, John Kasich, or Evan McMullin might be acceptable within the tent of the Democratic Party after all the shaking stops. It’s even possible that the Democratic Party might end up with some or all of the Trumpists. It’s not like the Democrats haven’t had their ilk in the past, after all: it was the ejection of the Dixiecrats from the Democratic Party in 1948, and more generally the decision of the Democratic Party to aggressively back civil rights, that triggered the realignment that ultimately ended the Fifth Party System and led to the establishment of the Sixth. And you’ll find the successors of those Dixiecrats firmly nestled in the core of the Trumpist Party; there’s no solid reason why they couldn’t end up in the Democratic Party after all this is done. The Trumpists do profess to hold a lot of what were Democratic positions during the Fifth Party System, after all.",3.3k,57,13.9k,"8,174",0,0
7,Is the Democratic Party a viable home for conservatives who reject Trumpism?,Political Conservatism,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"No, it’s not. I know because I considered it. And after peeking behind the curtain I am now more anti-Democrat than before.The most shocking aspect of Trump and his support wasn’t the economically illiterate proposals, boorish personality or even the possibility of trampling our entire legal tradition with his authoritarian worldview. Those bothered me a great deal, but it was all secondary to the fundamental assault on truth that his campaign waged and represents. I was dumbfounded. “How could half my fellow Republicans simply abandon the concept of facts? How could the other half go along with it?” Factual accuracy is nonnegotiable in this engineer’s worldview so I bounced.After Trump’s election I resigned myself to alliance with Democrats despite the tremendous gap in ideology. Maybe our shared distrust of Trump will allow us to find true common ground, especially since people will finally see the danger of unlimited government. Maybe I’ve just demonized them as the enemy. They at least seem to think they’re doing the right thing. Most importantly, they may be wrong, but they generally try to hew to the facts. Every thing they said about Trump during the campaign was true, and the same definitely can’t be said about the other side.It’s painful and embarrassing to write that. Because in all my years of political observation I have literally never been proven more wrong. Ever. Republicans made a blatantly false statement machine president. Democrats responded by engineering millions of outright lie machines and spreading them throughout the nation. In their homes, their social media accounts, their blogs, and their “news”.When called on it, the very same people who criticized Republican allergies to fact checkers double down, claiming that I’m dishonest to even question the accuracy of “muslim ban” claims. It neither banned only Muslims, nor did it ban all Muslims, and it exclusively targeted nations with very questionable government records, but if you brought such facts to the discussion the anger was deafening. The process repeated over and over, with only outrage and fury as constants. It didn’t matter what the facts were, “the resistance” would supply whatever was needed to maintain the outrage.And it frustrated me beyond belief to watch the other half of the country embrace this post truth madness. There were massive, entirely legitimate problems that Trump was bound to trip on, but everyone was so angry that they had to scream at the top of their lungs right now. To make matters worse, it was obviously diluting their credibility, energy, and ability to demand attention for real issues that needed a counter.So instead of a Trump Critic, I am now a Trump Critic Critic. Not because I want to be but because it’s necessary for someone to call bullshit on a lot of this. Not all of it. But a significant portion.Democrats like to think there’s some massive decency gap in the age of Trump, but from where I sit it’s just a bunch of dishonest partisans angry that the other dishonest partisans won. I’m sure most will dismiss this as a rant from another dishonest partisan, but the truth is I tried to see your side. I wanted to believe decency was alive in our politics.

7,Is the Democratic Party a viable home for conservatives who reject Trumpism?,Political Conservatism,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"I reviewed this before posting, and I see it rambles a bit. But it ultimately does provide my opinion on the OP's question.As a (mostly) former conservative, I really like Mike Jones' answer. I have never identified as Republican or Democrat. Like the vast majority of Americans, I hold a mixture of views that includes elements from all sides. However, I have found that Democrats (in general) are more willing to negotiate and compromise. They seem to be more open to hearing other points of view as long they can be argued rationally (as opposed to emotionally) and respect well-established facts. So, while I still don't identify as a Democrat, I feel much closer to them in tone. The greatest loss we have experienced in a generation is demonstrated by the cast-iron pledge not to bend, not to compromise, to stand on principle. Rigid inistence on being 100% right and the ""other"" being 100% wrong is responsible for the utter lack of progress on nearly any political issue in the last decade. Obama got his signature agenda item passed with no help at all from the opposition party, even though they had largely created the blueprint. Trump's signature victory so far is tax reform which had zero support from Democrats (and some even more rigid Republicans).Every conversation we have is an exercise in compromise. No two people agree on every single thing. But one thing I have observed with Democrats I know personally is that they will listen if you have a rational argument. The points made in Mike’s answer are excellent guidelines. Those four issues form the majority of the Democratic platform -- I would add acceptance of gay marriage to that list, along with the broader LGBTQ+ issues. But when discussing these issues, you are likely to find more common ground than you expect. As Mike points out, you don't have to personally be comfortable with abortion or a gay lifestyle or potential abuses of the social safety nets to recognize that government must tread carefully when imposing limits on individual freedoms.For example, you might make the case that too much of your tax money winds up in the pockets of lazy bums who game the system. (Yes, I have had this conversation.) A Democrat might respond by asking how you would do it differently -- would you really just shut down the entire safety net because of a few freeloaders?! You might argue that you think *most* of the recipients are freeloaders. At this point your Democrat friend may lay some numbers on you and invite you to check them out (and probably not direct you to a left-wing source such as MSNBC or VOX -- they know you won't consider them credible). Now you have gone back and forth in a discussion that can be productive. You might have a great idea about job training. The Democrat may ask how you would handle the children -- should we pay for daycare? Wouldn't that cost even more?My point is that I have had conversations similar to that one with several Democrats that I have come to respect. When talking to other conservatives about the same issues, solutions are rarely discussed. It's all about how Obama created a mess and how we have to get out of it. ""What mess did he create?"" ""You know, America's not great like it was because --- Obama. See? Democrats are the problem. Oh, and Hillary, too. Benghazi and emails.” Drops mic!The issue I always have with that conversation is that the problem is not the problem -- the problem is the ""other"". We have to ""drain the swamp"" because .... well, Democrats (""other"") are in there. See they have this deep state thing where they are planning on destroying America and handing it over to ..... somebody who is also ""other"". We have to wall ourselves off from the world because of the threats of the ""other"". We have to outlaw bedroom behavior that we don't understand or relate to because they are ""other"".Democrats have their own issues with acceptance at times. The very nature of Progressivism is that it embraces differences and change. It is often impatient with those who are more cautious, who are reluctant to embrace change for change's sake. Democrats too often unfairly project unpleasant motives on such people calling them racist or callous. Sometimes they are right. But sometimes they are not. Many people take time to adjust to new realities. Things move too fast and they worry that we will take a sharp turn in the wrong direction and come to regret it. The most obvious case is acceptance of Muslim refugees. I admit to some concern on that as well.Democrats (and Progressives in general) are more willing to accept risk as part of the American identity as a compassionate nation. The idealism behind that willingness is one reason that I feel comfortable hanging out in the outskirts of the Democratic party. Whatever my views are on any given issue, I feel more hope for the future when I talk to Democrats than I do with Republicans. I hope that changes some day and we see both parties working on real solutions to the real problems.",66,1,6,20,0,0
7,Is the Democratic Party a viable home for conservatives who reject Trumpism?,Political Conservatism,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"I wouldn’t say so. It’s no exaggeration to say that Trump and Trumpism contain aspects that conservatives don’t like. However, opposing Trump doesn’t mean that you are necessarily a Democrat.Prior to 2016, pretty much everyone on the right extolled the virtues of free trade and how more trade increases the size of the economic pie. Trump has famously talked about tariffs and retaliations against countries who don’t do as we say. That means some conservatives will disagree with the direction Trump is taking, but that fact that Democrats oppose Trump’s trade wars doesn’t change the fact that historically they have never been big fans of free trade agreements either.Ever since 2006, the right has been critical of undocumented immigration. Many conservatives are critical of the action, and often of the offenders. However, Trump has famously tried to limit family reunification and the diversity lottery - forms of legal immigration. Moreover, Trump has made it clear that the best surgeon in Kenya is less desirable than the worst barber in Norway. A ‘never Trump’ conservative may want to focus on limiting illegal immigration, but would find no quarter in the modern Democratic party.Among many on the political right, there was a belief during the Obama years that the government was choosing the winners and losers - especially when it comes to some of the hot button issues. Trump blatantly promised that his government would choose different winners and different losers.

1,Has a modern day Democrat politician ever openly support the NRA?,National Rifle Association of America (NRA),1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"I know many Democratic politicians who avidly support gun rights.Unfortunately, the NRA has evolved into the lobbying arm of the gun manufacturing industry, so asking whether or not I support the NRA has nothing to do with asking me if I support gun ownership rights. I support freedom of religion too, and think that Christians, Jews, Muslims, or anyone else of any other faith (or not) all have equal rights. It’s in the Bill of Rights after all, like the Second Amendment. That doesn’t mean I support terrorist organizations who profess to represent the views of one of these groups.Just because an organization says they represent a group doesn't mean that they do. When I was young (oh so long ago) the NRA represented gun owners and the interests of promoting responsible gun ownership and gun safety. That’s no longer the case. They are now a political organization that’s tightly aligned with the right wing.ISIS says they represent Muslims, and there are some Muslims who buy into their extremist and terrorist agenda. The Ku Klux Klan professes to represent the views of Protestant Christians, and there are some Protestant Christians who buy into their extremist and terrorist agenda. I could keep going with examples all over the spectrum, but you get the point, right?So supporting the NRA is very different from supporting gun rights. Few Democratic politicians will support the NRA since the NRA is so tightly aligned with the right wing. However, MANY Democrats (probably a large majority) support gun rights.In my experience, it’s a pretty small minority of Democrats who are actually “anti-gun”. I’m a conservative, a gun owner, and a Republican. In my experience, when I sit down and actually have a reasonable conversation with Democrats who are “anti-gun”, I find that we usually can find some common ground. We rarely end up in the same place together, but we can find some common ground.Usually, they’ll start from a perspective based on a misunderstanding of the Second Amendment, and a misunderstanding of existing gun laws. However, once we’re on the same page with this stuff, we generally find a shred of something somewhere that we agree on, even if not on everything.Of course, I do run across extremists now and then. Folks who essentially want all guns banned. Those folks are rare in my experience. Especially when we start talking about the consequences of messing with the Bill of Rights. And both sides of this argument have extremists. Some want all guns banned, some want zero regulation on the sale of arms.Both are extreme views. Neither view represents the majority of Americans. Unfortunately the NRA has become aligned with the second extreme view. Back to the original question, right? This is why few Democratic politicians are likely to support the NRA — they represent an extreme political agenda.Yet, Democrats all over the place strongly support gun rights. I suspect that the majority of current elected officials who are Democrats strongly support the entire Bill of Rights.

Do they think the whole world, from China to New Zealand to UK was ruled by Reagan or the republicans?They will tell you it’s not true.According to World Inequality Report 2018, published ahead of the Davos meeting this year, The US-Canada has higher income inequality than Europe, China, and Russia.Historically high inequality in the Middle East, Brazil, and Sub-Sahara Africa have all been trending down. Russia went on a turbo-charged polarization in the early 90’s, but the oligarchs have largely been under control by year 2000. China started tackling its income inequality around 2010 with its poverty-reduction program, and it seems to work, slowly. And Europe has been able to largely control income inequality within a narrow band. So obviously, there are many other places where wealth can be re-distributed to address inequality.If you include off-shore wealth, then Europe looks better, and the US looks worse.The ultrawealthy have 10% of global GDP stashed in tax havens — and it’s making inequality worse than it appearsSurely you can see that poor people are not your enemies? They have no money so they can’t buy your product, which reduces the size of domestic consumer market, and your own business opportunity. Poor people are also restricted by the lack of opportunities so that they don’t get to maximize their own productivity, which reduces the overall productivity of the labor force.

The truth is that the West is comprised of the most egalitarian nations on Earth - and they damned well know it! As with any religion, you have the high priests, then the congregation. Not everyone thinks past the songs the choir sings, and the majority of the sycophantic congregation believes the cutesy sound bites and memes online.For Democrats, and honestly anyone invested in a belief, it’s really hard to question the tenets of that belief. But it’s especially harder for those on the Left, as they aren’t very forgiving of those who go ‘astray’.Inequity is a wedge issue (one of many) for the Democrats, and the Left in general. Yet, the Left is silent when it comes to the deaths of millions under socialism. It used to be that they could quote Marx’s theories and ‘solutions’ and that would be enough. The State will ‘wither away’, they’d say.It’s become quite clear that every time it’s tried, Socialism and Communism fail - whether it’s because of corruption, debt, or a misunderstanding of the advantages of a free market.Since the blatant corruption of former Communist states like the U.S.S.R. have been made manifest, the Left needed a new wedge to rile people up: Inequity.They used to talk a lot about class struggle, but now they delight in pointing out the inequities between races and gender, as their own ranks are filled with millionaires and rich media personalities.For left-leaning Democrats, the ‘struggle’ has become gender-less bathrooms, racism (as an explanation for all the ills of a particularly corrupt culture), unlimited immigration (and thereby adding more Democrat voters), the silencing of Conservatives through media intimidation, and socialized medicine.Gone are the days when the Democrats cared more about the out of work industrial worker or other downtrodden citizens, which is explains why so many of those people voted for Trump in ‘16.Democrats use their wedge issues to agitate and cause friction.

Governing agencies are (a) having trouble keeping up with the progress in the financial field, so they can’t effectively set rules and regulations, and (b) are prevented from doing so even if they wanted because the trend is toward deregulation.In America, this has recently manifested itself in the form of healthy inflation, great economic expansion, lightning fast development of new technologies in every field imaginable, and an increasingly large proportion of all new money going to extremely wealthy people who spearhead these endeavors. Many of the richest in the country literally have so much money that they cannot spend it (they know not to invest in stupid shit, which is the only way they could possibly spend it legally). This means that even though the market is expanding and the economy is doing pretty well, the supply of money going to the middle and working classes is remaining about the same. This means that we’re at an unstable equilibrium right now, made even less stable by the current president, who has a pension for impulsive statements about trade, war, has a precarious relationship with the rest of the world, blah blah blah I figure you’ve heard all that.Basically, we’re playing a balancing act, where an underdeveloped economic foundation (working and middle class) supports a well-developed economy and overdeveloped (too big to fail) wealthy class. It’s inherently unstable, which is why large amounts of inequality are dangerous and failed against by liberals._ _ _ _ _So, the premise of liberal ire having been stated, I will try and answer what I believe is your question: Why do liberal people believe that inequality has increased in magnitude around the globe in the past ~40 years?The answer shouldn’t surprise you: It depends on how we examine the data. Globally, inequality had been on the downturn since the 70’s. However, inequality has been creeping up between classes within countries. Basically, most markets are growing well, but an increasingly large proportion of wealth is going to those at the top in many developed nations. This is fine for global development, but it destabilizes each individual market, and if one crashes, there’s a domino effect.As you may have guessed, the difference in opinion likely stems from a disagreement on which pieces of the economy we look at.To answer your second question, no, I don’t think that most believe that American politics have been able to govern trans-continentally with any real success.",102,3,78,46,0,0

In the past 6 of 7 election it hasn't though. This is due to the large number of democratic zombies lurching to the polls to stuff them ballot boxes to the brim again with the dead the fictitious and the illegal.

You'd think that if you're going to play a high stakes game, you'd learn the rules and come up with a strategy where you can win under the rules, rather than using a strategy where you fight hard for things that aren't worth any points, and then complain that you think they should have been worth more points. It's like a football team repeatedly complaining that they should have won because they completed more passes.(b) It proves that you can always cherry pick data to get the results you want. In the 14 Congressional elections covering the same period, the Republicans won 10 and the Democrats won 4. I didn't check elections for governors or state legislatures or mayors or whatever in that period, but given that Republicans now control large majorities of both of those, I'd guess Republicans did pretty well in other elections in that period, also.(c) Despite the fantasy of some conservatives, liberalism is far from dead. I remember when Bush won the election, Republicans wee crowing about the ""permanent Republican majority"", and pointed to demographic shifts that resulted in population increases in more conservatives states. Then Obama won an election and the Democrats were celebrating that ""there will never be another Republican president"". I recall watching a story on CNN with Wolf Blitzer where he talked about the tidal shift to Democrats. Then he proceeded to explain how just a handful of states had voted differently from the last election, and how in these states you could trace the shift to a handful of counties. After saying how the whole country was turning Democrat, he then ""proved"" this by showing that just a few counties had turned Democrat. And then Trump won the last election, and I hear lots of conservatives saying that liberalism is dead. Ignoring claims of vote fraud, Clinton got 48% of the popular vote and Trump got 46%. In 2012, Obama got 51% to Romney's 47%. In 2008 Obama got 53% to McCains 46%. In 2004 Bush got 51% to Kerry's 48%. Etc. Liberals and conservatives in America are very evenly divided.

Nor do I believe there is a meaningful alt-right of any significance, if it exists at all.Having said all that, make the request for help more serious, such as for money, or for sustained support (such as welfare), then the response gets more complicated, and there is some political crossover.If it is a question of child welfare, then the political right and left generally regard that as essential for the future of the society, but the political left and right might differ significantly on the best way to provide such support — the right favoring strong nuclear, two-parent families, and the left favoring left-run . indoctrination institutions (such as they would like schools to be.)But if it is a question of adult welfare, then the political left and right are starkly different. While we don’t expect children to have the maturity and means to be self-sustaining, nearly everyone on the political right expects adults to be. The political left, however, merely tags low/non-performing adults as “victims” of the political right. While the political left apparently have no sense of personal responsibility, it is more likely that it is just political expediency for votes.However, there is a significant portion of the political right, primarily evangelical Christians, that buy into the notion of victimhood for low/non-performing adults.

I’m pro-choice.

I believe that a woman has a right to do what she wants to her own body—and don’t tell me that it’s “not her body,” because I understand that. The thing is, though, is that it’s a thing that is physically attached to her body that her body created, and in my view, that counts.Secularism. Religion can sometimes be beneficial to some people, but I don’t think it should be taught in public schools, and I don’t think it should dictate our laws. I frown upon anyone who uses anything written in the Bible or Torah or Qur’an or whatever else to back up an argument completely unrelated to religion.Gay rights. This is a negligible one, because in the U.S., it’s really a non-issue these days. We have our rights. The majority of Republicans don’t actually care about fighting against gay rights anymore. But place me in any past decade, and I would’ve been on the Democrat side of this debate.

Just don’t force it on your kids like some psycho parents are doing these days.Republicans:The Constitution. This covers a lot, and to be honest, I don’t think it should even be a party issue. The Constitution, in theory, should be the glue that holds both sides together—the inarguable human rights we all hold. But the first and second amendments in particular are widely opposed by the left, and I, on the other hand, defend them with every other breath. I oppose “hate speech” laws and I oppose stricter gun control than what the most red states already have.Capitalism. Even Hillary Clinton has vocally praised capitalism, but unfortunately, so much of the left is caught up in the Bernie “Democratic Socialism” Sanders side of things. It’s pretty sad that simply agreeing with the market model that built our country into the successful, thriving nation it is today is now considered right-wing. I believe in the power of the free market, limited government regulation of businesses, and lower taxes.School choice. This one may seem rather minor compared to the previous two, but it’s extremely important to me as it affects me and many of my friends and loved ones personally. I am homeschooled—have been since third grade, so for nine years now—and my choice to leave traditional school has proved to be the best decision I ever made. I believe that if public schools do have to exist, they should be regulated on a town or at least state basis—not federal, no more common core—and that more funding should go towards charter schools. Homeschooling should also be more widely encouraged; I’ve seen the stigma surrounding it deteriorating slowly over these past nine years, but it’s definitely still there.There you go.

3,The National Review refers to Democrats casting endless spotlight on Trump & his lawyers. Is it realistic for the President’s legal problems to “ not be an issue. “?,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"College-educated voters and suburban women disgusted with Trump may be enough to win the Democrats a slim House majority. But Democrats won’t find themselves in a truly commanding position until they make inroads among the Rust Belt voters who abandoned Hillary Clinton for the president. The more the party focuses on Robert Mueller and Stormy Daniels, the less likely it is to recognize the appeal of Trump’s economic message and to adjust accordingly. The more the party falls for the self-flattery, empty rhetoric, question begging, and maze-like complexity of media narratives—not to mention the more it succumbs to the fever-dream of impeachment—the less likely it is to recoup the power it once enjoyed.No, that is wishful thinking, and it is certainly propaganda. It is intended to suppress the Democratic vote by bringing about an increasing degree of anomie and alienation from politics, both of which benefit Republicans. Despite what some writers for the National Review would have you believe, the owners of major media companies are not overwhelmingly Democrats.Take a very good look at the composition of that electoral majority in the critical Rust Belt, and take a look at the percentage value in the popular vote that delivered that tiny margin in the popular vote, but which delivered a large enough margin in the electoral vote.There is no doubt some truth in the notion that the voters mentioned in the article made the difference, but there is more than one truth and more than one set of voters involved here. The margin is tiny. Flip 50,000 votes in all of the involved Rust Belt States, or turn out half a million more Democrats, in the critical States, and the election would have gone the other way.Anger against the President’s “legal problems” not to mention his “moral problems”, his evident incapacity, and his unending and blatant lies, may well prove to be a major motivating factor for Democrats. It certainly should be, if it is not.Not only a swing among white surburban women was responsible for what happened, but also a swing in the vote, that was arguably caused by the action of the self-same media, the very same media that normalized Donald Trump, while demonizing Hillary Clinton in 2015-2016, the self-same media that this article now is complaining might actually damage Democrats. This article amounts to the shedding of crocodile tears over a Republican victory that is at best uncertain and which has not yet occurred.A significant depression in the black vote relative to 2008 and 2012 occurred, of about 7%. That made the difference too. Some 70% of white men voted for Trump, making me a rarity where I live, near to New York City. Hispanics in Florida voted apparently in larger than expected numbers for Trump.Trump has no policies and no agenda that benefit his voters, contrary to the other claims of the article. Besides, all media are making a careful effort to make very sure that voices supporting Donald Trump are still heard, and that such people are respected. I have heard more from Alan Dershowitz in the past year than I ever needed to in a whole lifetime.The article ignores that anger is a motivating force, or it should be, considering that the economic agenda here doesn’t come from Donald Trump, it comes from Paul Ryan and the Randian capitalists.I hope we will see increased turnout among Democrats, because that is all that it takes. A majority in the House, not even a large majority, and then, if the Democrats in power finally screw their courage to the sticking point, everything changes. Suddenly we will have Congressional hearings with subpoena power and the willingness to use it and then the very real and simple and perfectly obvious crimes of Trump and his campaign will be made as plain as day, just as plain as the completely obvious corruption and incompetence of the greater number of his cabinet appointments and his White House.There are multiple indictments and guilty pleas resulting from the Mueller investigation already.

That’s largely correct. But if they’re living in that much of a reality-distortion field, there is nothing the Democrats can do to reach them. Effort toward that end would be largely wasted, no matter how it was done.What does matter is the independent voters, and Democratic turnout. And dislike of Trump can be a powerful force in both of those two areas. Those who will support Trump even if he commits his hypothetical murder in Times Square won’t be swayed no matter what Mueller or the NY investigation turn up, but independent voters may well be turned off by a president who makes it clear he thinks he’s above the law, and Democrats may be motivated to turn out to put the brakes on such a man.So, the article is right that Trump’s legal woes won’t sway his die-hard base.

3,The National Review refers to Democrats casting endless spotlight on Trump & his lawyers. Is it realistic for the President’s legal problems to “ not be an issue. “?,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"NO it’s not.Continetti is making a few valid points but he is also relying on weak preconceptions to underpin those points.The first is the myth of the liberal media. Media is a for profit operation largely controlled by multinational corporations. Trump and scandal sells.These same entities spent months on Clinton’s emails, to the exclusion of almost everything else. Scandal Sells.What democrats are suffering from is their own malaise and a lack of leadership. Pelosi and Schumer are great fundraisers, competent parliamentarians and effective whips they are not National Leaders.The constant scandal has created an expectation of an eminent impeachment but that isn’t happening, not with this Congress.While Trump’s numbers are up, Congress is no popular today than it was 4 years ago. This Congress has one legislative achievement, the Tax Bill, and it’s far less popular than Republicans had hoped. It’s also not kind to the less dedicated Trump voter.Continetti loves the Tax Bill. He has repeatedly failed to process that it drives debt and for the Right leaning voters out in middle America, debt matters.Now Continetti does make a valid point. The Democrats could safely ignore Avenatti, Mueller and the SDNY. They would be better served focusing on concrete policy outlines and perhaps writing their own bills. Even should Speaker Ryan not take them up they could be bullitproofed for later.The media will continue to feature Michael Avenatti every day because he is ratings gold and he is also the karmic backlash for Donald Trump’s Media manipulations over the past 30 years. Avenatti is trolling the President, using the President’s own techniques.This is still the National Review though. It’s partisan. They know full well that poling is no more accurate today than it was in 2016. They also hold some fear that an upwell Of Sandinista Liberals could be brewing out in the hinterlands.So for Continetti and the National Review this isn’t about Trump at all. This is about the potential death knell of classical conservatism. Trumpism is not Conservative and real Conservatives have suffered under Trump. Too many Republicans are leaving and the NR is rightly worried that the future GOP will have too many Louis Gohmerts, Matt Gaetz and Jim Jordan’s and not enough Bob Corkers.Trump’s scandals won’t go away. Not if Congress Impeached Rosenstein and Mueller gets dismissed. Not if the House committees run roughshod over the expected norms.Benghazi was perpetuated by Right Wing Media much more so than Trey Gowdy and Jason Chaffetz. The Trump scandals aren’t being pushed by whatever the left wing version of Drudge Report is. They exist on network television. There is blood in the water and the sharks will feed no matter what the Republicans desire.Michael Avenatti will be an omnipresent figure until 2020. He was a major piece of legal artillery before this, he has become a phenomena and that makes him infinitely more dangerous to the President than the Justice Department. He has proven, repeatedly, that he knows more than he is telling and he is almost casually filing out damning information on a cycle meant to deliberately undermine the President’s actual achievements. If he has enough ammo he can continue this until 2020.Democrats could still lose out in the midterms. We are talking about the Democratic Party. That loss may not be a win for the Republicans though. The GOP is in trouble, they’ve increasingly become obsequious toadies and that could cripple them going forward in National Elections. If the only path to prominence is in defense of a polarizing President then the Presidency could become elusive for another rescale going forward.",230,4,275,"1,378",0,0

2,Would you vote for a democratic candidate if the democratic candidate was pro-life?,Democratic Party (US politics),Republican Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"Q: Would you vote for a democratic candidate if the democratic candidate was pro-life?A: This is almost like asking 2 questions, because probing the willingness of “pro-life” Republicans to support a “pro-life” Democrat is quite different from probing the willingness of “pro-choice” Democrats to support a “pro-life” Democrat. And yet, in both cases it’s an interesting question to consider.Personally, I’m a “pro-choice” Democrat, and while opposing a women’s right to terminate an unwanted pregnancy would be a major check-mark AGAINST a Democratic candidate, I’d still evaluate all the other issues before making a decision. It’s conceivable to me that, if I otherwise liked that “pro-life” Democratic candidate enough, and I had sufficiently strong reservations about the Democratic alternatives, I might support the candidate in spite of disagreeing on the abortion question.For one thing, I have almost no willingness to support any candidate I regard as corrupt. I’m not talking about the normal mild corruption that’s automatically baked into our system of financing political campaigns, which taints almost everyone in politics, but instead the kind of major corruption scandals, typically for self-enrichment, that we see from time to time. So, for example, I could not see myself voting for Democratic Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey. I could easily go for a pro-life Democrat over him. But I don’t live in New Jersey, so I don’t have to face that particular dilemma.Another consideration is, which candidate can win in the general election? I’d much rather have a “pro-life” Democrat in office than a “pro-life” Republican, so if I perceived that the “pro-choice” Democrat had a significantly lower chance of winning the general election than the “pro-life” Democrat, this would influence me to support the “pro-life” Democrat.You may have noticed that I’ve used quotation marks around “pro-life” and “pro-choice”. This reflects may feeling that these terms are inaccurate. Most people who claim to be “pro-life” hardly seem that way to me. They typically support the death penalty, support American military adventurism, and oppose public programs that truly help keep poor people alive - like food stamps, mental health programs, universal healthcare, needle exchanges, drug treatment programs, support for great organizations like Planned Parenthood that do so much to protect women’s health, etc.“Pro-choice” is less of a problem, but is still a gross oversimplification. Both “pro-life” and “pro-choice” are more marketing slogans than accurate reflections of complex, nuanced positions. Thus the quotation marks to show that I use these terms for the sake of being understood in spite of my objections to them.",52,1,278,"2,897",0,0

If successful, and they could be successful, that means things like higher taxes, less freedom to dissent, many more regulations, and, just in general, a vastly higher amount of government.Jobs in the free economy will vanish, as firms close, or at least hunker down and try to save their basic assets. At the same time, jobs will open in government. Government jobs will require an absolute loyalty to the government itself, whether or not it is personalized in the Leader, or just an abstract.To work for the government is, in a sense to BE the government, or at least it’s physical arm. The government will exert a stultifying amount of control over every facet of American life; life itself will be less valuable and therefore whatever limited inhibitions there are now to abortion will be radically diminished.To support a Democrat candidate, any Democrat Party candidate, no matter his/her pretended opposition to abortion, is to support the denial of unborn life.",49,0,46,808,0,0

3,Why do Democrats silence birthers but encourage ridiculous stories about Trump?,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"I’d like to just share an interesting anecdote that I actually have heard from three separate and totally independent sources - namely, “Wait, Wait, Don’t Tell Me” on NPR, an interview with a writer for “The Daily Show with Stephen Colbert”, and a commentary on a local news program in Seattle.In the Obama days, and even to a large extent during G.W. Bush’s and Clinton’s presidencies, comedians and their writers actually had pretty easy jobs. They could find all sorts of ways to satirize the current president, poke fun at recent events, and criticize the president or his detractors. This is because the writers generally had a lot of good source material to work with, which allowed them to do what they do best: Be creative.That’s how it was with the Birthers. Professional comedy writers had mountains of jokes they could write about Birthers, just like they do about Flat-Earthers. Each time a new person made headlines questioning Obama’s birthplace and calling his birth certificate a fake, the comedy mills were on it, ridiculing that person for propagating a bald-faced lie. They really made it too easy for them.With Trump, however, comedy writers suddenly have it a lot tougher. And that’s because they actually can’t come up with anything funnier or more outrageous than what is actually happening in real life. The comedians themselves, as performers, are having to ad-lib more often than before, but even more telling: The comedy is more in how they present the facts and their personal reactions to those facts, and less about creative wording and incisive puns.The local commentary said that this had never happened before in his career. He thought that his job would be ridiculously easy once Trump got into office because, given the guy’s personality, he’d be providing what comedy writers often call a “target-rich environment”. But when Trump started his regular “Twitter tantrums”, started making terrible decisions that shocked even people in his own party, and “doubled down” on things that were obviously and ridiculously false, comedy writers literally ran out of ideas. How could they compete with that?I believe this was echoed by the Daily Show writer as well. The Daily Show, under Jon Stewart, had already gotten a reputation as being a somewhat reliable (if sharply liberal) source of news because it actually did report on current events - just in a pointedly funny way. But with Trump actively piling on to the train wreck that is our government, the Daily Show is actually much more a news program in some ways than even CNN is. As many people have said before, “You can’t make this stuff up, folks.”I mean, seriously. Who can write a funnier joke than Kellyanne Conway’s statement about Sean Spicer giving “alternative facts”? She said it so deadpan, too. A masterful delivery, made all the funnier by the fact that she was so completely serious about it.When the jokes write themselves, that’s when comedians have to worry about their jobs.",9.4k,97,354,"1,710",0,0

And Israel is a Nationalistic entity. The Democrats regard all people as equal, and are eager to adopt anything that supports their narrative without any critical observation. Now, Equality of opportunity is great. Equality of rights is great. What is NOT great is the assumption of equality of OUTCOMES. The Democrats seem to believe that all outcomes should be equal, and if they are not, someone evil (the stronger) are screwing those who have less. Thus, if some businessmen make a lot of money, it must mean they have taken from the poor.

During the war, many Winston residents enlisted with the Union Army.[1]Indeed, in 1860, there were only 14 slave owners in Winston and only 122 slaves.[2]Rather than plantations, Winston has a lot of mines; it is more like Appalachia than like most of the South.Thus, the major reason that the south was solidly Democratic for 100 years (1865 - 1965) do not apply to Winston.However, Winston was not the only county in the South (or even in Alabama) to vote Republican in the early 20th century.

Bush did absolutely nothing for the anti-abortion religious forces that backed him in two elections. Since 2010, the GOP has done nothing but give lip service to this issue with their attack on Planned Parenthood. (But the Republicans know they can’t pass any type of real prohibition of abortion as it will be struck down immediately in the courts. When will the churches realize that they are being jerked around in order to get campaign money and votes?)Same-sex marriage: the GOP has abandoned the religious right on this issue completely.Taxes: the latest tax cuts will end up as tax increases for as many as 19% of middle class people (defined as annual income of $67–120K), depending on their state, while corporations and the 1% will enjoy massive tax breaks. And never mind how blowing an even bigger hole in the federal deficit will adversely affect the government programs on which so many people in Red states depend.The fragile nature of the religious right voting blockFrom a historical perspective, the Christian right is a fairly modern construct. The country was split between the Christian Abolitionists who fought the slave holding Christians. Same gospel, but a completely different interpretation.The Women’s Suffragette movement was powered by deeply religious women who drew on theological reasons to support the campaign.The power of a Christian voting block was used as a cudgel to force politicians from both sides of the aisle to pass the Prohibition amendment in 1919.And relgious forces played a large role in the Civil Rights movement in the 1960s, as Northern white churches sent their people to march alongside their black brethren fighting for equal rights in the South.It was only the Roe v. Wade decision and the Republican’s recognition that abortion could a powerful wedge issue that would fill their campaign coffers and help win elections for the last forty years.However, we are beginning to see cracks in that voting block as some church members are turned off by issues like the Iraq War, income inequality, and equal rights.Be careful about people learning the “facts”The chances of black voters changing parties because of some “fact” being revealed are slim and none, considering the huge amount of evidence that the GOP’s policies don’t help them at all.On the other hand, there is an excellent chance that millions of white voters will change parties because of poor job opportunities, income inequality, and the recognition that Republicans will never deliver on abortion.In 2016, approximately 55.4 million whites who voted for the Republican ticket. If the white working class, white Christians, and white middle class all recognize how their interests are not being served by the GOP, that could result in a shift of far more than 8 million votes.In spite of Gerrymandering and Voter Suppression laws, even a tiny shift in white voters would sweep Republicans out of Congress and the White House.",1.8k,49,858,135,0,0

Hangover Park, Cook County, IL suburb, which was about 20% Black voters, 20% Hispanic voters, 5% Asian, went 65% for the most conservative, anti-corruption, anti-swamp Republican slate in a 3-way race. The 20% of Blacks went about 25 or 30% for the Conservative Republican slate.But then the state Republicans chose an establishment swamp dweller who wanted to murder Rolando Cruz to be the candidate for governor. The area went 80% Democrat, including close to 100% of Blacks and Hispanics.Over a couple years, the Hispanic vote increased from 20% to 30% or more. The Black vote remained about 20%. The conservative Black Pastor’s wife did both the internet game and the ground game and the area shifted from 80% Democrat to 87% for the extremely conservative, small government, social conservative slate against the coalition slate of the establishment Republicans and Democrats.For the total vote to get to 87% Republican, at least 87% of Blacks and 100% of Hispanics had to vote Republican. That is because the divorced, promiscuous angry pro-abortion white women who gave Hangover Park it moniker clearly did not vote for the extreme conservative Republicans.So the Black vote flipped back and forth dramatically due mostly to the ground game and internet effort of the Black Pastor’s wife.Take another example.In Chicago in the 60s the IVI-IPO and Republicans formed a coalition against the Democrat machine. They elected Republicans Ogilvie, Kucharski, Woods, etal. But it was mostly white Democrats who were flipping, not Black Democrats.Then the Democrat machine came down very heavy on the few independent Black Democrats who were leaving the plantation. The Democrat machine assassinated a couple Black Panthers because they were talking political, and appeared to be forming political coalitions with Hispanics and whites.Suddenly, a major portion of the Black community flipped to vote for Republican Bernard Carey.

This is a nonsensical statement, i.e. it makes no sense to say those words in that order in this context.

That was either a typing error or a troll statement, but I cannot tell which.“…""what were you thinking when you decided to fire Comey?”That particular question is central to the matter, so that it would be irresponsible not to seek an answer to it. A very credible case might be made that Trump’s firing of Comey was an attempt to obstruct this very investigation and prevent criminal activity from being detected and those guilty prosecuted. To not look into that possibility would itself be an act of obstruction.And now to the question that was not explicitly asked but which certainly seems implicit in this warped narrative:“Why are people expecting Trump to have to obey the same rules and laws as everyone else?”Because he inserted himself into this situation of his own accord. “If you can’t take the heat, stay out of the kitchen.”Edited to add this, based on an edit to the context of the following part of the question:“Collusion has been turned into obstruction…”Both are just elements of the overall investigation. The investigation is into the nature and extent of any illegal activity which occurred related to Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

That polarisation is likely to encourage a far more significant turnout for 2020, as people either wish to ensure Trump stays in office, or cast their ballots to get shot of him as a one-term President.Worth bearing in mind: those who voted for Trump constitute the likely entirety of his personal support. There aren’t likely to be many pro-Trump supporters among the non-voting eligible demographic, so even an additional 5% turnout will swing the 2020 election away from Trump, and in favour of one of his political opponents.Provided they can speak in full sentences, campaign positively and try to speak to bipartisan consideration, I don’t think it’ll much matter who runs against Trump.

When we win the White House and the Senate, we’ll nominate whoever we want, and it won’t be a compromise like him!”) So it was all the more soul-crushing when they didn’t.That’s why nobody really cared that Democrats gained seats.

If you’re not sure about this, think about the selection of a jury - that’s the closest thing we have to Athenian democracy today, where the judge is there only to make sure that the jury’s decision has been determined according to the law of the land.I hope this helps. :-)",89,0,7,224,0,3

If they take the House, but not the Senate, that’s about the limit of what they can do. They could vote article of impeachment against Trump, but unless he does something worse that what we know he has done so far, he won’t be convicted by the Senate.If the Dems take both the House and the Senate, then it gets interesting. In this case, the Dems can not only investigate Trump, they can stop his judicial appointments—which is appearing more and more crucial to saving America as a republic. Since it is extremely unlikely that the Dems can swing enough votes to get a 2/3 majority in the Senate, impeachment and conviction still seem unlikely. But a Democratic Congress could stop the worst of Trump’s excesses by refusing to fund things like the border wall, they could block his inane tariffs, and pretty much checkmate him.Then one of two things could happen: 1) The Democrats force Trump to the bargaining table and get back most of w hat he gave away; or 2) Trump will cry that the election was rigged and refuse to deal with the Democrats.

Not even close.) with respect to Russia, and can get it to stick to Trump, then he is not only unlikely to win re-election, he is unlikely to stand for re-election.Or perhaps even to serve out his term.If, OTOH, Mueller turns out to be Ken Starr v2.0, then all of Trump’s “fake news” and “witch hunt” blatherings will be supported to one degree or another, and the Democrats will look like petty, sore losers.That still remains to be seen.Second, the main thing for any president is how the economy is perceived to be doing. If the economy continues to appear to be getting stronger, with low (reported) unemployment, rising wages, and no explosion in inflation or interest rates, then rightly or wrongly, Donald Trump will get a lot of credit.Third, and this is a real wild-card. On the foreign policy scene (where, unlike the economy, the president does have significant, real impact), if President Trump can score some victories (right now, the North Korean dialogue could actually be a legitimate feather in his cap if he and John Bolton can avoid messing it up), he is going to disarm a lot of the complaints from the left about how his obnoxious style is destroying American credibility abroad.None of these things really will be influenced by the Democrats’ choice of candidate.Where their choice matters is in how it will either heal or rend the internal wounds of a party that is, frankly, and angry coalition of people with disjoint priorities that frequently clash.",91,0,260,"1,757",0,0

I think we THINK we are.But imagine if the internet had existed when the national guard had to escort the first black children into previously white-only schools. That was some serious division. Can you imagine what the comments would look like on sites like Quora, Facebook, and Twitter? The divide was REAL. The racism was REAL.

4,Why are Americans so much more divided across party lines now than in the past?,Political Parties,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"A variety of factors including political strategy, media strategy, wars, shootings, scandals and traumatic events, technological progress and social movements among others have contributed to greater hostility since 1994 when the pew survey referenced in the link began. The tendency is not completely linear - for instance after 9/11 there was a relaxation and coming together, but the overall trend has been towards division - though in a seeming paradox the parties themselves seem to be weaker than in the past.The origins of this trend are debateable. I tend to trace it roughly to the early Clinton Presidency and the Republican tactics against him, as well as the concurrent boom of ideological talk radio hosts (Limbaugh first among them). Clinton’s election was a tough pill for Republicans to swallow, and his scandals (especially the sex ones) made a tantalizing target that his opponents seized on, and the conflict escalated through out his Presidency, culminating in the attempt to remove him from office in 1998.After that, things might have calmed but there was the extraordinarily tight election of 2000, decided by the Supreme Court. Then there was the aforementioned post 9/11 coming together, but that momentum was lost when 18 months later the US went to war with Iraq. From there there was series of events & revelations that infuriated a lot of people - from WMD to Guantanamo to Abu Ghraib - and brought out a lot of true animosity as opposed to political disagreement towards Bush and the Republicans (aside: I was in law school during this time and remember one of my profs who had been in government for ~30 years, most notably in the Clinton administration, saying that it was the most polarized time she’d ever seen - and it’s mostly gotten worse since then!)After Bush, with the country falling into a financial crisis, Obama swept in with the message of hope and change. Whatever the man himself wanted (I think he was in truth fairly moderate and really wanted to unite people), many of his supporters hailed him as the victor who would stamp out the Neo-Con ideas of the Bush years and usher in an era of fairness and social justice, while many of his opponents saw him as the antithesis of everything that America is and stands for. The result was an era of initial victories followed by partisan gridlock and disenfrachisement with both parties. That disenfranchisement spilled over into the next election and here we are today.In addition to the sequence described overall trends helped push it along. The shift towards social media and niche media in place of large generally accepted outlets has played its part. The gay rights movment and the ferocity with which it fought against the religious conservative establishment play its role in bringing many into the fold while alienating others. In the last 5 years the visibility of police shootings and black lives matter has played a role as well, and of course the rise of the so called alt right, with its appeal to angry young men. Also the rise in seemingly random school shootings and the intense emotions associated with them has played its part.In sum, it’s hard to boil down to individual factors, but there’s been a broad and long term trend of divisiveness. Nonetheless, as others have noted there have been times of greater division (like the Civil War era or the late 60’s), and in some cases those times have led to better times for more people.",84,1,8,199,0,0

Is the Democratic Party too socialist to elect anybody who supports capitalism?,Socialism,Clinton-Kaine 2016,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,"No. The Democratic Party is part of the Corporate Oligarchy… as is the Republican Party. The successful post war mixed economy (capitalist/socialist) of the mid to late 20th century no longer exists.To understand this, first take time to understand the difference between Socialism/Socialist and socialism/socialist. As has been pointed out capital S socialism is a form of government where the means of production is owned by the government. Everyone who has a job, works for the government. Theoretically everyone without a job can count on the government for support. That form of Socialism has been implemented several times, always with poor results. Government leaders gain power, get greedy and corruption sets in. The result is so much inequality that the system collapses… often violently.Capital C Capitalism would be a system where every product an service is comes from the private sector where it must be produced at a profit or Capitalist investors won’t invest in it. Such as system has never been implemented because essential infrastructure and public services often can’t produce an acceptable return on investment.Most governments have mixed economies that implement both capitalism and socialism. Where that’s the case, government levies taxes to pay for public products and services. For example, law enforcement, national defense, shared infrastructure, public education, public health and various social services.The capitalism component provides private products and services which are produced and sold at a profit. In some cases, private enterprise may compete with the government by offering enhancements to the public version of things like education. For example citizens can choose private schools if they have the resources.In other cases, the government may contract with private enterprise to provide things like health care or military products and services. In those cases some tax dollars are diverted to profit. The government is charged with regulating both public and private enterprises to ensure that consumers, workers and the common environment are protected.As you can see it gets complicated, and there are countless ways to skin the proverbial cat. A key element in determining whether a given implementation works well or fails is corruption.Unfortunately for U.S. citizens, corruption has reached a point where income inequality is reaching levels usually associated with failing Socialist regimes. This is a bi-partisan problem. Both dominant parties participate in implementing laws and regulations that fail to protect the nations citizens while acting in the best interest of big money supporters. A Corporate Oligarchy has replaced the Constitutional Republic created by the founding fathers.The Oligarchy always comes up with a reason to reject mixed economies that are working reasonably well. Examples are Scandinavian countries, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and so forth. You see them in lists where CEO pay, shown as a multiple average worker pay, is a number more like 30 instead of the 300+ common in our Corporate Oligarchy.Thanks for asking.

1,Does the US Democratic Party have anything of pragmatic value to offer me if I am Caucasian and am not an ideologue who really cares about emotional arguments?,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"I think it should offer you, at the very least, an opportunity to research and empathize with other points of view. The way the question was worded suggests that you do not know much about what the US Democratic Party represents.Basically, the differences in outlook and the policies of the two major parties as they are stated in their platforms and in the historical descriptions of the parties change over time. The Democrats used to be the party of Conservatism and states rights up until the time of the early 20th century, but then the parties basically switched places over the course of the next 60 years or so. The Republican party was the federalist, monopoly busting, national park creating, immigration encouraging party, all the way up to just after WWI. The Democratic party became the party of organized labor and Progressivism shortly thereafter, in some measure due to the challenges of the Great Depression, and the fact that FDR was President for an entire generation, and he was definitely not a Conservative. He tried anything and everything to fix the problems he inherited with the shattered economy of the time. The final break for Conservatism and the Democratic Party came in the 1950s to the 1960s, when the majority of Southern Conservatives who had not already changed to Republican over civil rights laws broke ranks and started moving to the right.However, the current Democratic Party has become somewhat unfocused, largely due to the fact that Progressives and Liberals of all stripes have been joining the Democrats because of the rightward shift of both parties. The focus of the Progressives, starting in the late 19th century and continuing through the Theodore Roosevelt administration, is on the responsibility of society as a whole towards its members. This has resulted in things like the Food and Drug Administration, Social Security, the five-day workweek and laws against child labor, Medicare, Welfare, Civil Rights laws and Voting Rights laws, Rural Electrification, regulating the Banking and Investment industries, and the movement towards universal health care and clean energy. Not within those things are definitely some things that benefit everyone, even those with privilege. I would personally say that I benefit, )as a Caucasian anti-ideologue myself,) from the rest of society not having to worry about survival and the reduction of wealth disparity in general, with its attendant decrease in crime and disease; and the economic, social, and health benefits of some control over the worst instincts of unfettered Capitalism.Whether or not one is an ideologue, there is a logical argument to be made that your point of view, and your own personal context drives your emotional response to any philosophy. None of us are Vulcans without emotion, and when you get into political discussion, many of our positions are driven by fear or anger or joy. So the thought that someone getting angry over the positions of the party they disagree with or afraid that something within those positions will be bad for Caucasians, or joyful over the success of a candidate from the party they do agree with is somehow not the majority of what makes up most arguments on both sides of the political spectrum is silly. Emotions run very high when talking about sacred cows on either side, and at that point, it is very likely that logic and facts are tossed to the side of the tracks as the train barrels on towards the inevitable point where one side paints the other as inferior.Half of the country on one side and the other half on the other side is the model we have currently chosen for our politics. This is an enormous oversimplification, though. The fact that we buy into it is due to our preoccupation with an us versus them type of worldview. Many people, especially but not exclusively on the right, view the world as a zero-sum game where the success of others means that there is less success around for themselves, and some of us then translate that into the belief that those we disagree with are inferior and their misfortune should therefore be celebrated.Basically tl;dr: The current Democratic Party offers quite a few things that benefit the country, but one must look beyond the propaganda to see what it is. The same with the other side, but at this point, we are in a place where what was the political center is what used to be center-right, because the far right is currently in control.",42,1,35,249,0,0

She represents no new ideas, resistance to change and universal healthcare, and loves big corporate sponsors. I don’t think Clinton was the best candidate the Dems could have put forward by far, but at least Clinton has a proven track record of success in her role as government. You can look at her record and on the whole she has done a pretty good job.

Did she make some mistakes in her handling of the situation? Perhaps. But it wouldn’t be the first time. Look at the leniency the GOP gave Bush after he willingly IGNORED a memo that clearly said: BIN LADEN willing to strike in US. Nothing was done about it and that was the most appalling terrorist attack on US soil in history. And where was the outrage? Nowhere. They rallied around Bush as he led us into not one, but two horrible wars we are still paying for while making all the corporations richer..

1,What do you Democrats say to the fact that Hillary admitted that acknowledging her capitalist history hurt her with her voters?,Clinton-Kaine 2016,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"I can’t speak for other Democrats — just for myself. I think that Hillary was demonized by a number of people: Trump, Comey, Assange, many media figures — and Bernie Sanders. She’s someone who has often chosen the less lucrative job as she’s gone through life — working for the Children’s Defense Fund exposing racist schools and representing indigent people in court who can’t afford to pay a lawyer were not the most high-paying career choices she could have made. Neither she nor Bill Clinton were all that rich for many years — but as Bill Clinton was leaving office, Republicans were continuing to vent their fury at him, and explicitly said they were out to destroy his ability to work as a lawyer, and also wanted to humiliate the Clintons and bankrupt them with a million legal fees. They did manage to do that for a while. They also screamed that Bill Clinton would be paying too much for office space in NYC at tax-payer expense — until he got an office in Harlem on 125th Street, which startled the Republicans and muted their yipping … But the Clintons didn’t like having to borrow money from their friends, and paid them back, and decided to make sure they’d never be in such a position again. They wrote books, and gave speeches, and made money in various legal and reasonable ways. They also established the Clinton Foundation which (unlike the bogus slush fund Trump Foundation) they do not profit from; the Clinton Foundation is a real charity and quite an effective one. The Clintons give to it but do not take from it.But Democrats get spoiled when a Democrat is in office; they forget how corrupt and greedy and focused on government by, for and of the rich the Republicans are. That happened after eight years of sensible, more or less centrist government by Bill Clinton. Ralph Nader, as an idealist crusader, was effective in the spoiler role in the 2000 election — and we got stuck with George W. Bush. Something similar happened in the 2016 election after eight years of sensible, centrist government by Barack Obama. Bernie railed against Hillary for taking corporate money (like Bernie she wanted to get rid of Citizens United and get money out of politics, but she did not unilaterally disarm on that front during the campaign), for wanting to gradually move to a minimum wage of $15 an hour in some places where the cost of living is lower, and for having slightly more moderate/centrist positions than Bernie in a number of areas. He was an effective spoiler. He demanded to read her speeches to some companies like a dad demanding to read his daughter’s diaries or personal correspondence. He created a sense that she was corporate and a sell-out, not to be trusted, and obscured her life-long fight for universal healthcare and for women and families, and her policy proposals for universal free pre-school and to end the college debt crisis, fix and expand the ACA, raise taxes on rich people, etc. Donald Trump was able to capitalize on all of this — cynically yelling he’d “drain the swamp” (his administration is crawling and slithering with the kinds of Goldman-Sachs people Hillary got yelled at for talking to) and hollering that she’s “so corrupt” and so on. (Trump’s administration is the most corrupt we’ve ever seen — and it’s not just the Goldman-Sachs people who are profiting off the average taxpayers as in a banana republic.)As Hillary says, capitalism isn’t so bad — when there are safeguards, and transparency, and mechanisms to make sure the rich don’t just gouge the poor.

That’s lazy thinking. Election dynamics are much more complicated than that. For instance, 12% of Sanders’s voters voted for Trump. Trump is also a capitalist, so this theory doesn’t seem to make sense. Moreover, there is more than meets the eye with this statistic.Trade issues didn’t make much difference among Sanders supporters.Many Sanders-Trump voters probably weren’t Democrats. Sanders’s Obama supporters mainly voted for Clinton.There was a racist and sexist component to Sanders-Trump support.However, defections on the order of Sanders-Trump are not unusual.For example, Schaffner tells NPR that around 12 percent of Republican primary voters (including 34 percent of Ohio Gov. John Kasich voters and 11 percent of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio voters) ended up voting for Clinton. And according to one 2008 study, around 25 percent of Clinton primary voters in that election ended up voting for Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., in the general. (In addition, the data showed 13 percent of McCain primary voters ended up voting for Obama, and 9 percent of Obama voters ended up voting for McCain — perhaps signaling something that swayed voters between primaries and the general election, or some amount of error in the data, or both.) Here's How Many Bernie Sanders Supporters Ultimately Voted For TrumpThere is no single, easy answer to why Clinton lost. She ran a lackluster campaign. She was unfairly tarnished by decades of right wing smears. Comey’s reopening of the file server investigation right before the election. Fatigue with Democrats after eight years of Obama. Nationalism and immigration. Not least, sexism and racism:The 2016 campaign witnessed a dramatic polarization in the vote choices of whites based on education. In this paper, we have demonstrated that very little of this gap can be explained by the economic difficulties faced by less educated whites. Rather, most of the divide appears to be the result of racism and sexism in the electorate, especially among whites without college degrees. Sexism and racism were powerful forces in structuring the 2016 presidential vote, even after controlling for partisanship and ideology. Of course, it would be misguided to seek an understanding of Trump’s success in the 2016 presidential election through any single lens. Yet, in a campaign that was marked by exceptionally explicit rhetoric on race and gender, it is perhaps unsurprising to find that voters’ attitudes on race and sex were so important in determining their vote choices. http://people.umass.edu/schaffne...To point at the widely known fact of Clinton’s capitalism is almost farcical.",81,1,210,"1,223",3,3

If you want the political world to ignore you, the most important rule is to avoid ever giving money to parties or candidates.I've never lived in a swing district. If I had, maybe just registering for a party would be enough to bring in the mail.

One group ready to give, another ready to take. What's the problem?",Democratic Socialists of America,Socialists,Social Democracy,1!,1!,1!,"The devil is in the details.When billionaires come together to establish charities, they cannot simply spend their capital but only the income.The amount of money required to simply spend for the poor run into trillions. So the charity revenue from Warren Buffet and Bill Gates of, say, $500 million is only a drop in the bucket.Vicious cycleThe biggest challenges comes from the phenomenon of a vicious cycle. A country is poor because less family planning is being practiced by the general population, leading to a high birth rate and a huge population relative to its land area. Babies are born in poor health, which leads to a huge drain on the national budget for health care, hospital, and schools.This in turn leads to a low level of skills that its average citizen has. This further leads to low income manufacturing income and low wages, which leads to low national revenues for the state. This in turn discourages foreign investors to invest in a country caught in such a vicious cycle, because the risk is too high.The most powerful class that can spur GDP growth is the middle class in all the countries around the world. But this requires affordable public housing, creation of jobs, a reliable banking system, and the collection of revenues.Building up a large and prosperous middle class is a long and laborious task for the government. This is a thankless job so that even conscientious leaders slowly sink into an evil situation of simply enriching themselves through corruption.The Belt and Road InitiativeI believe that The Belt and Road Initiative driven by China for several years now is the most powerful global economic model to improve global economics, world trade and shared prosperity.However, while it is very profitable in the more developed countries, it is facing violent resistance from poorer countries.To carry out these win-win infra-structure mega-projects, land has to be acquired by enforcement of land acquisition laws of these countries.

One group ready to give, another ready to take. What's the problem?",Democratic Socialists of America,Socialists,Social Democracy,1!,1!,1!,"Most rich do everything they can, legally and illegally, to avoid having their wealth gains classified as income. No income = no taxes and there are a number of easy legal ways to gain wealth without paying taxes.Our income tax system favors the wealthy investor class over the worker. And most of the super wealthy are interested in getting more wealth for themselves,, not giving it away. They donate to the Republican party who solely represents the interests of the super rich and corporations.The system is broken. And Gates and Buffett are the exceptions that want to use their wealth to benefit others. The solution is not to rely on charity, but to fix the system so that the wealthy pay a fair share of the wealth they accumulate in taxes. Buffett and Gates both amassed a fortune and paid very low tax rates on that wealth gain. I’m guessing that while a working class person making $200k pays close to 50% in total taxes, they likely paid far less than 10% of what they gained in total taxes. And by giving it away now, they avoid paying any more taxes on their gains.I would favor a wealth tax as the income tax has been corrupted to favor the rich and I don’t see it being fixed. FTR, simply raising the marignal rates won’t do much because the rich don’t pay much of what they get in income taxes. Remember no income = no taxes.Let me give you a couple simple examples. I put 100 million in real estate which allows me to buy 300 million with leverage. That real estate doubles appreciates in value over the next 20 years. My original 100 million investment is now worth $600 million. I’ve gained $500 million in property value over 20 years. How much do I pay in taxes, over 20 years, as that property value goes up? Answer = nothing.In fact, over those 20 years I can a tax deduction/ depreciation that offsets any rent I might receive, so that as that property is going up in value, I’m getting a tax write off assuming the property is losing value.You can do the same thing with investments in business or the stock market or art or anything else that goes up in value that the investor class might buy.And those are just the obvious legal means of gaining wealth tax deferred or tax free. That doesn’t count offshore tax havens etc. Bottom line, if you are wealthy and invest in real estate, stocks, businesses, you can gain wealth that is virtually tax free.Bill Gates estimates he paid less than 10% of his 90 billion of wealth in taxes. And now that he started a charity, none of the rest of that money will go to the government. I’m sure Buffett has simlar numbers. Mitt Romney released tax returns that show he paid about 13% on millions of dollars of income, and those returns were carefully selected as he knew he was running for President and would be releasing them. I’m confident his other returns show an even lower rate. Most billionaires that are not blinded by greed and full of themselves will tell you in an honest moment that the tax system is a scam and that the super wealthy don’t pay a fair share.Working class people pay 30=50% of what they earn in salary in taxes. The super wealthy pay less than 10% of the wealth they gain — different from taxable income — what they earn in taxes. That’s not being jealous of their success. That’s saying the tax system is patently and irrevocably broken to favor the rich investor class.",161,5,138,"1,219",0,0

Hardly ever does employees most in need of a raise get it. The benefits stops really fast with the owners and shareholders and top employees, the trickle down effect is stopped at the top floor.Social welfare on the other hand benefits people in need and those people boost the economy through consumerism, since they suddenly can pay for some of daily necessities, that they had to go without before.So the value in the hands of poor people will go up the chain through businesses and effect everyone positively, while corporate welfare completely bypass the lower income half of the population if not more. Those who actually needs welfare to eat, get healthcare and get a better chance at climbing out of their situation.Also social welfare through universal healthcare have the benefit of a supply of healthy worker bees, who have more time and personal resources to engage themselves in the community and their work, to be more innovative and self sufficient earners as their professional lives thrives.It is better everyone gives a little to get a lot of value respective to their situation in life, rather than everyone at the bottom are left with nothing, while those at the top gets all the value.Child poverty and huge income inequity is not a sign of a country that is thriving.",98,3,57,755,0,0

3,"If Hitler were alive today in America, would he be a Democrat or a Republican?",Adolf Hitler,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"This question is rather odd, given the existence of neo-Nazis today, and the lack of difficulty at discovering their politics. Why are people continually asking it?The Nazi Party would be aligned with the protestors at places like Charlottesville some of whom gave Hitler salutes.The Nazis in their time were very much aligned with the right, and fought (often actual fighting, like street brawls) with Socialists and Communists (despite having a word that, in English, is loosely translated as “National Socialism,” at the time they fought viciously with every flavor of actual Socialism — just like North Korea’s “Democratic People’s Republic” is none of the three despite sticking some words in their name.)At the time, the Democrats (most notably FDR) in the US were strongly opposed to the Nazis and pushed to help the Allies in WWII, while elements on the right such as America First wanted to stay home. The same patterns are true in the Spanish Civil War, with the left and the Nazis on opposite sides and non-fascist conservatives dawdling, etc etc. Get any history book — and ask yourself why people are managing to confuse themselves on something that was never in controversy. The demographics who voted for the Nazi Party inside Germany were also switching from conservative parties, opposed by a divided left and center.It seems beyond obvious that Nazis transported to today would line up pretty closely with today’s actual Neo-Nazis, either forming bitter splinter movements or voting largely for Trump. Hitler himself is a harder call: if he wasn’t in charge, if those people giving straight-arm salutes weren’t actually saluting him, it’s quite possible he would be a bitter complainer, tweeting angrily over his beers. Right-wing movements often have a big separation between leaders and followers, and the leaders don’t like to follow other leaders. [See: http://theauthoritarians.org/Dow... ]The actual Nazi party had vicious in-fighting, killing each other off. Hitler built a political movement rather quickly from a splinter, rather than joining and working his way up: he would try to do something similar to a Tea Party, a movement he could be in charge of, either within or squabbling to take over the Republican Party; he would not have been a fan of Romney working his way up slowly.",89,1,131,834,0,1

The belief that their world had gotten out of their control, they had been harmed by the aliens amongst them (Jews, Poles, Slavs, etc.), and that they had to protect themselves from those that wanted a global society and have international rules dictate their internal living, laws, and business.

A very modern day Republican, and all those afraid of the world, and believing there are internal and external conspiracies to ruin our Empire will support him and urge him to take the reins of government and start cleaning us up… including dismissing a Congress if it becomes Democrat, ignoring courts that rule against him, and calling for his supporters to start enforcing their “right way” throughout the country.And, if he was attacked legally, via elections or indictments, he would call for his people to rise up and strike a blow for freedom and keep him in power to “fix this broken nation and make it great again.” As only he could.God… it sounds so like where we are today and where we might be very soon.",102,2,111,173,0,0

0,Are public school teachers registered more as Democrats or Republicans?,Democratic Party vs. Republican Party,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Public school teachers go into the field of education out of a sense of love for the future. They tend to be idealists, far less concerned with money than with helping children grow into happy, productive citizens who contribute to the well-being of the world. You make a pretty pathetic salary as a teacher, and for those who say, “yeah, but they get the whole summer off,” well, no. There are lesson plans to draw up, summer classes to teach, classes to take to keep their accreditation or to get an MS or MA degree, because a lot of school districts require an advanced degree.This isn't an 8-hour job where you can go home and forget about work, either. There are papers to grade and after-school activities that you're responsible for overseeing. I had a brief career as a science teacher. One year I was hired to replace a teacher who quit one month into the year; it was for a magnet program in astronomy for 7th grade, in a public school that I have referred to ever since as “the school from hell.” I love astronomy and knew the subject. I'd been a middle school teacher before, always enjoyed working with that age group, and got along well with them. There was NO curriculum provided to me to teach. I got an average of 3 hours of sleep a night during the school year, and wound up quitting a month before the year ended when a parent came in and screamed at me over something that happened when I was out for a week (a huge metal window blind had fallen on me, leaving me with a permanent scar on my face- the administration never called me to find out how I was.So this is part of what teachers face. I'm sure you've seen pictures of some of the teacher's strikes during the past few weeks. Many of those teachers have such a terrible supplies situation- not enough textbooks, out of date science books, no paper for their students, etc., that they've started GoFundMe campaigns. Much of their own salary goes to supplies for their classrooms.States that are run by a Republican governor and/or legislature have typically been saddled with an anti-tax sentiment. Guess what programs are cut first? (In all fairness, the same is true of at least some blue states.) Take a look at the so-called “Kansas miracle.” Even the Republican legislators who initially thought it was a good idea are appalled at the results.Those who announce that they don't have school-aged children, or children in public schools and therefore don't want to pay taxes to support public education, fail to understand that the kids from these schools are the people who'll grow up to be the medical care workers who will take care of them in their old age, or the mechanics who will fix their cars, or the lawyers who will keep them from losing everything if they need long-term care or fall for a scam, or the actors or actresses who will entertain them- or the teachers who will influence the minds of THEIR grandchildren. Not to mention, giving kids a decent education means that they'll be less likely to turn to crime- thereby also lessening the need for a heavy police presence. Now, THAT'S a productive way to cut taxes.No group is monolithic. There are certainly public school teachers who are proud Republicans and voted straight Republican in the last election. I'll bet there will be fewer of them for the midterms and future elections, though.Teachers are trained to think of the long-term future, not the short-term. They consider the consequences of their actions, and their votes. You won't find a public school science teacher, or teachers of most subjects, who refuse to accept the realities of the theory of evolution, or climate change, or our landing on the moon, realities that many Republican politicians do not accept. History teachers understand that because of unions, we have laws against child labor and a full weekend; many Republican politicians are anti-union.

A million people left, those people being most of the wealth of the city itself.It's a massive problem because of all the cities in America, Detroit has had the largest shift in population in the past 30 and even 60 years. From 1,849,568 in 1950, to 1,203,368 in 1980, finally to 672,795 in 2016. If any city lost 2/3 of its inhabitants they'd be losing their minds. Mind you these really weren't the least of all its citizens either, these were mostly white folks who could afford to move out of the rust-belt, as the entire north-east lost most of its manufacturing economy only the poorest stuck around in places where opportunities were vanishing.Detroit itself is often targeted as a failure for the Democrats, but it's not. On average Democratic states have a larger GDP, higher earnings and better rights. That includes Michigan. Detroit is just a sad relic of a bygone era, a place where many African-American families fled to in order to escape Jim crow era laws, just to become segregated and denied many opportunities. Then, as manufacturing began to decrease, people who could chose to leave, meaning even less jobs were available for the service industry and hundreds of thousands of abandoned properties were just left to decay.There's no solution to a problem as big as this, so assuming it's the failure of a political party requires a lack of understanding what happened.

6,"After the Democrats screwed up Detroit, why do you still support them?","Detroit, MI",Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"Did they really? It’s true that Detroit experienced a profound urban decline, but does it make sense to blame the democrats for what happened?You could draw that conclusion, if you wanted. But you would be wrong. See, Detroit’s decline wasn’t caused by the folks who would eventually inherit the reins of the city- and if you look around at other cities in the United States (with their liberal, cosmopolitan constituencies) it’s interesting that the Querent singles out Detroit and seeks to generalize across all Democrats, as if they’d managed to bankrupt everything they touched.In 1960, Detroit was among the most-prosperous of cities in the United States- a booming Auto industry was let to run the show, and it boomed alongside many other American contemporary cities… which also experienced contractions and economic problems as the Rust Belt decline happened… but Detroit’s collapse is singular, extraordinary.So why has Detroit suffered unlike any other major city? Planning, or the lack thereof for more than a century, is why Detroit stands out. While cities like Chicago, Philadelphia and Los Angeles (don’t laugh — Detroit and LA essentially boomed at the same time) put a premium on creating pleasant built environments for their residents, Detroit was unique in putting all its eggs in the corporate caretaker basket. Once the auto industry became established in Detroit, political and business leaders abdicated their responsibility on sound urban planning and design, and elected to let the booming economy do the work for them.~[Nine Reasons Why Detroit Failed]So, you could say that Detroit bet everything on the Auto industry, and much of the industry left town (which it did for a lot of reasons). There wasn’t enough space in Detroit for the industry to expand the way it wanted (again, a lack of planning), and when the industry set up shop elsewhere, Detroit found itself without the economic base to support itself.But the real story here is that Detroit was left holding the bag at the end of one of the finest parties of its time, and it was an expensive party. The debt obligations for a lot of pensions wound up on Detroit books, and the costs for those things ballooned at exactly the same time as the population collapsed. When your costs suddenly spike and your revenues collapse, it doesn’t matter who’s at the helm of the financial ship, you’re screwed.So, what made Detroit different from other industrial cities, like Pittsburgh?Pittsburgh didn’t let it’s steel industry run it’s government and then leave town. It still suffered a stiff economic shock when the oil embargo/stagflation years idled a lot of American industry, but was more diversified and didn’t suffer as badly as other cities did.But while we’re at it, we cannot ignore that the most prosperous places in the country… aren’t all run by Republicans. So what does this tell us about the viability of liberal policy? It tells us that some conservative/reactionaries today aren’t above cherry-picking data if they think it will support their pre-conceived notions. Because if we’re going to look at Detroit for examples, we also need to look at Austin, at Seattle, at Los Angeles, at Chicago, at New York, and the rest of urban America.

1,Why do the Liberals and other Democrats simply refuse to actually read the US Constitution?,U.S. Constitution,Liberalism (politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"I have to disagree with the premise of this question which is that conservative/Republicans read the Constitution and liberal/Democrats do not. By and large, I think most American’s from both side do not read the constitution. However, this doesn’t get at the issue raised by this question, which I think is more accurately described as why do conservative/Republicans tend to root their arguments in the language of the constitution, as opposed to liberal/Democrats.I think on a basic level this conflict comes from differing views on the role of the constitution in current affairs. The document is over 200 years old. Conservatives and Republicans tend to be more “strict constructionalists” and Democrats and liberals tend not to be. However, I think the key issue is how do the different groups read the constitution.A nice example of this arises in the Scalia’s opinion in DC v. Heller.The Court begins consideration of Heller with a careful discussion of the meaning of the second amendment which reads: “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.” The court divides this amendment into two clauses. The first “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, …” was called the prefatory phrase. The second, “…the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed” was referred to as the operative clause. The court begins its consideration with the operative clause.The court starts with the operative phrase and focuses on the meaning of “the rights of the people” by examining other places this phrase or its parts (“rights” and “people”) are used in the constitution and conclude that “people” in this context means “… all members of the political community, not an unspecific subset.” Scalia goes through several different words and phrases in the operative clause before deciding that the point of the operative clause is two-fold. First it guarantees to “… the individual right to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation.” Second, it is not a statement of a new right but simply a codification of an existing right.Having done all this, the court then turns to a discussion of the prefatory clause.This ordering of the discussion of the clauses was an important part of Scalia’s argument regarding the right to bear arms. However, many people on a plain face reading of something would start with the words that come first. Thus, they would have switched the order and possible come to a different conclusion.My point is that both sides conservatives/Republicans and liberal/Democrats can read the constitution to support their positions, in most cases. The difference is how they use the Constitution, and how much deference they give it. I think conservative/Republicans give more deference to an argument that quotes the constitution, then liberal/Democrats. These difference go to the vary root of the difference that American citizens have about their own government and that isn’t unusual in a country this large.So my short answer is I’ve never met a liberal or a Democrat who actually refused to read the constitution. However, I have met several who read it differently than the conservative and Republicans that I’ve met. I also see a difference among liberal/Democrats, as oppose to conservative/Republicans, regarding the amount of deference they give to arguments which root themselves in the constitution.I hope this is helpful!",81,3,5,48,0,0

He is not articulate nor a great public speaker, in many respects purposely talks in a rambling all over the place style to relate to the regular guy.He’s angry and prefers to blame everyone else for self imposed wounds that he himself or his administrative staff have created. He seems to have problems with understanding rules and procedures and that they are in place to stop you from making bad mistakes (ahem, Adm.

Not one person ever saw the inside of a jail cell over widespread “irregularities” during the world economic meltdown that was the 2007 housing bubble correction. There is the fact, among many, many others, that the recipient of bailout money, Goldman Sachs, was much more (shall we be generous and say) “politically active” than Lehman Brothers who were (again, let’s be generous) “allowed to suffer the repercussions of the free market” (which was their bankruptcy). To my eyes, this looks like GS paid their bribes and LB didn’t. This, in the midst of a labyrinth of conflict of interest rules for everyone else.An American can incur legal expenses worth the value of a house in navigating our legal system.Yet here we are: “Rule of law for thee, but not for me.” If politicians expect us to uphold a cultural creed of Rule of Law (without ironic laughter), the ROL must apply as much to them. Much more really, as they are virtually all lawyers, and ought to be setting some standard of leadership (OK, OK, you got me, I laid it on too thick right there, I had to take twenty minutes to type that for my hysterical laughter).Ben Franklin wanted it to be possible to impeach a President for “obnoxiousness,” by the way. Not too late to hear him.There was never an attempt to impeach President Obama. While I almost completely disagree with his philosophy of governance (he believes in top-down models of power, where I believe in bottom-up), I think he was essentially honest, and deservedly scandal-free. These scandals cannot be conjured out of thin air (lookin’ at you Clintons).Hard to imagine genuine legal reform if the laws don’t apply to the lawmakers (if we grant that they even know what’s in the laws they make).So, more impeachment would be a nice start.",826,6,53,329,0,1

Essentially that big government always knows best and knows how to spend your money better than you do, and those who don't buy into collectivism are evil. Too many are familiar with history or have escaped repressive regimes that their “solutions” sound similar to, to really buy into BS such of this. So while the most vocals progressives are out there attempting to dictate genderless language (and any other obfuscation possible) to everyone else and Dem leadership is oblivious to the economic problems many voters face and fails to tamp down on their own party’s crackpots not to mention have any sort of economic plan aside from heavy taxation for more government bloat (and corruption), such messages don't really have a chance against more jobs, lower taxes and less government interference in our day to day lives.So, to summarize, I think the Dems need to reevaluate their policies before seeking a viable candidate. Of course, it will take proper judgment to come up with one and well as policies people actually want, and neither of these things were on display in the last election. Based on the hysteria in the media, which is almost all in with the DNC, I would say Dem leadership is out to lunch and not much has changed. But without policies people can actually support, it won't count for much even if a great candidate is found.",65,4,66,127,0,0

8,"Can a Democrat explain where, according to the Constitution, Donald Trump is any more or less qualified than Barack Obama?",Democratic Party (US politics),Barack Obama (politician),1!,1!,1!,1!,"This question is dripping in ignorance.The claim that Donald Trump is not fit for office is nearly entirely non-consitutional in nature.No one educated in Constitutional law believes that complying with Constitutional requirements is equal to being fit for office. For example, the Constitution does not prohibited an institutionalized mentally retarded person from running for office and being sworn in (this is a hypothetical and any resemblance to the current president is purley coincidental).But if you want a cite to the Constitution, then I refer you to XXV.4, which states the president must be able to “discharge the powers and duties of his office.”Donald Trump has persoonality disorder that makes him incapable of receiving and weighing advice rationally. Further, he has an apparent learning disorder that prevents him from effectively absorbing written information. Finally, he exhibits signs of a degenerative neurologica disorder that renders his ability to deploy large words and complex sentences in the ways he did in the past.Beyond the above, he has deficits that reach many other arguments for his being unfit for office. It is growing increasingly clear he probably committed a crime or crimes. He has a long history of alleged wrongdoing that has resulted in litigation that was typically settled, usually confidentially. The people have a right to know the truth about their president. He ought have no right of privacy against us.Worse, Trump has deliberately conducted his affairs in ways that create the ongoing impression he has conflicts of interest. Some of those conflicts are so blatant that their existence is beyond denial, such as his owning a DC Hotel popular with foreign diplomats. People who say these conflict might not be what they appear to be miss the jpoint. POTUS ought to appear to be free of conflict of interests in addition to being free of same in fact.

8,"Can a Democrat explain where, according to the Constitution, Donald Trump is any more or less qualified than Barack Obama?",Democratic Party (US politics),Barack Obama (politician),1!,1!,1!,1!,"The United States Constitution (specific, because there are more than just one constitution) is pretty short. There are the Bill of Rights included, but these are amendments to the constitution. The document is often revered for this shortness and simplicity, but it leaves open a lot of interpretation. That interpretation often comes down to precedent and traditions. And when it cannot, it is interpreted by the Supreme Court. So while there is really nothing in the constitution that could distinguish between the qualifications of Barack Obama and Donald Trump, you can understand why DT is considered a non-traditional president in many ways.An example of tradition/precedent: George Washington as our first president set many precedents. He was general in the army, but purposefully shed his uniform as president so he didn’t appear as a King, or what we might call a dictator today. He also served two terms. This was his choice, not in the constitution. It wasn’t until after FDR (who served 3 terms, there was no law against it till the 1950s) that the two terms became formalized in an amendment.The first few presidents all came out of the founding fathers. This set a precedent of having presidents with a strong command of how the US government should function. Many of these early presidents were also lawyers. They also served in high level cabinet positions (secretary of state for example) Most presidents have come out of a position in government, have had a strong understanding on the fundamentals of government. Sometimes these are state governors, or senators. Occasionally there are military commanders (Grant, Eisenhower). But even then, there is an understanding of how the government works, and how laws are passed. Barrack Obama fits this tradition: ex-senator, community organizer, and also a lawyer. He has experience in the U.S. Government and law. Donald Trump majored in business and never served in office before. There were debates about BO’s qualifications and how long BO was a senator for, but DT never served an office. So in terms of these precedents BO was much more qualified for higher office than DT.In this list of previous occupations: Presidents' Occupations Every single previous president had some form of experience working for the Governement (including military), and many of them were lawyers allowing them to understand how laws work.There may be a debate about business experience superseding these as a qualification. But, arguably, DT has not been able to get a signature piece of legislation through and this is probably a result of his lack of governmental experience. Also, the Federal government is not a business, nor should it be run like one. Consider this: no business has the ability to print its own money.",1.9k,34,27,134,0,1

8,"Can a Democrat explain where, according to the Constitution, Donald Trump is any more or less qualified than Barack Obama?",Democratic Party (US politics),Barack Obama (politician),1!,1!,1!,1!,"One person on Quora likened elections to job interviews. I would correct that by saying that the election is the final choice an employer makes from the short stack of applications after a long series of job interviews (campaigns). Elected officials are applying for a job, and it is we the people who are their prospective employers.In the real world of job seeking, employers look for the best fit for the position, starting with application data and resumes. Does this person have the necessary skills and education to meet the employer’s needs? If there was a personality or reliability test given, how did they score? Sort, sort, sort…the number of applications and resumes is reduced to a manageable number to start the interview process.It is during the interview process that the employer gets to assess those qualities that do not appear on the application or resume. There, the employer can determine if this person will work well with others, if they seem honest, if they are ambitious, personable, good or ill humored, tactful, and so on. Sort, sort, sort…the pile of applications gets smaller until only a small few remain upon which to base a decision.There may be an additional round of interviews. Sort, sort, sort…now the employer is down to two, and makes their decision between them.All the while, of course, the applicant is trying to sell themselves to their prospective employer. They highlight their strengths, downplay their weaknesses. They positively compare themselves to their possible competition, but usually can do this in only very generalized terms since they wouldn’t necessarily know who they are competing against. However, even if they knew, to mention the competition by name, and to criticize them, is a big, fat, no-no: To do that tells your prospective employer that you could be a negative element in his workforce, and he does not want that.Only in the job interview process that we call a political campaign can the applicant get away with bashing on their competition by name, and even then, we the employer get sick of it. “Negative campaigning” is a curse on our system, but one which has been part of the democratic election process since the earliest republics, so we live with it.As to the Constitution’s requirements for the job of president, there are almost none. You have to be at least 35 years old, be a natural-born citizen of the US, and have a pulse. This is understandable when you want to create a government system in which any common person can aspire to the presidency, and thus protect that government from potential aristocratic tyranny such as was suffered under monarchal rule. The Constitution does not require a minimum educational level, does not require previous experience, does not require a particular skill set, does not require any kind of testing, nor does it require a background check nor physical exam—some or all of which are requirements found in any common private sector or lower level bureaucratic public job!However, common sense will tell you that any job has some minimum requirement beyond bare vital statistics, and this is just as true for the job of president as it is for working as a cashier.And yet, we ignore that fact when we decide who to hire for president, in spite of the year-long interview process (campaign). We seem to skip the step of looking at resumes and applications, and go straight for the interview where we allow the applicants to song-and-dance their way into our hearts, instead our minds.Obama’s pre-presidency resume, while not perfect (no one’s is), was far and away superior to that of Trump’s. HRC’s resume, frankly, blew them both out of the water (even Obama, as well as other past presidents, admitted that she was far more qualified than they were when they first ran for the job). Trump had zero experience in public service. He possesses none of the skills (both tangible and intangible) required to do the job well. His education is not only suspect, but has about as much application to the job as a liberal arts degree does to a manufacturer of steel pipes (like a liberal arts degree, any fool can get an MBA—and I know plenty of fools who have one). Had there been a personality and reliability test, such as even a retail chain requires, he would have been considered a risk and would not qualify for further consideration.Put bluntly, the man was and still is, completely unqualified for the job in real-world terms, and under real-world circumstances, his application would not even have gotten past the first review! His only qualifications are those minimal requirements set forth by the Constitution, and those are a piss-poor minimum at that.Perhaps it is time to update the requirements for the presidency to include at least some kind of elected or appointed public service experience which can be properly documented and vetted before a person can apply to run for the job. Anything really…dog catcher, school board, something…some minimal little requirement that an applicant has to be able to put on their resume to show that they have experience with dealing with public policy.",148,0,6,101,0,0
8,"Can a Democrat explain where, according to the Constitution, Donald Trump is any more or less qualified than Barack Obama?",Democratic Party (US politics),Barack Obama (politician),1!,1!,1!,1!,"(disclaimer: not a Democrat…not even an electoralist)The Constitution actually does define qualifications for the presidency…binary ones:*citizenship (natural born, as opposed to immigrating and naturalizing);*age (35 years old);*residency (14 years);*term limit (shall not have already served two terms as an *elected* President).Thus, constitutionally speaking, there are hundreds of millions of people who are already qualified — or will become qualified — for the presidency of the United States in their lifetime.Of course, this is not really what most people are alluding to when they speak of qualifications for office for the presidency. They usually have in mind some combination of professional experience (especially in public administration, like holding prior state or federal office), the ability to consciensciously take into account rival or even conflicting interests of constituencies, familiarity with state and federal laws, history, international relations, and finally, some sort of expectation of personal integrity according to whatever moral compass or ethical principles they happen to prioritize. That’s the real baggage or set of expectations latent in a supposedly simple appeal to “qualifications.”If you endorse some version of that unofficial set of qualifications for the presidency, then the usual differences cited between Trump vs. Obama is that Trump not only doesn’t measure up well (to put it mildly) by those standards, he is frequently the antithesis or perfect opposite of qualified on those grounds: no public administration experience, rampant narcissism and disregard for others, gross ignorance of the law, history, and international relations, a record of atrocious personal conduct (including bragging about sexual assault and publicly encouraging racist mob violence).In contrast, Obama rates above average on common expectations for a presidential candidate…he has some prior experience in office, he has sufficient charisma to convince constituents that he understands and appreciates their respective situations and interests, he was a leading figure in the study of constitutional law at an elite law school, he addresses foreign leaders on a peer basis (as contrasted against literally not knowing where they are from, or how to pronounce their names, or even a superficial recent history of their countries), and — as politicians go — Obama has had remarkably few incidents of controversy in his rise to presidential candidacy, in spite of facing special resistance, smear tactics, and flat opposition from both personal and institutionalized racism as a black man living under systemic white supremacy.There are plenty of substantive critiques to be made of Obama…from other perspectives…but relative to Democrats and the common expectations of Democrats, Obama was an exceptionally well qualified candidate, and Trump was/is a frontal assault on the most minimal standards of substantive and personal qualifications for the presidency.",9.3k,442,40,4,0,0
8,"Can a Democrat explain where, according to the Constitution, Donald Trump is any more or less qualified than Barack Obama?",Democratic Party (US politics),Barack Obama (politician),1!,1!,1!,1!,"Two answers - the Emoluments Clause and Section 4 of the 25th Amendment.As for Emoluments, Trump is being investigated for a number of things including violating the Emoluments Clause. he’s actually being sued in federal court for it. https://www.washingtonpost.com/p...Can I say categorically he is in violation of it. Yes. (accepting payments from the government outside of your salary is in fact a violation of the clause and he bills the government for the use of his properties). Putting that aside, we elected a man who has not given us a complete record of his finances, his foreign interests, and it’s unclear (because he has not shown us his taxes) if he is being influenced by a foreign debt to a person, bank, or country. The Emoluments Clause requires Trump sells off all his interests (which I would guess are not worth the $10 billion he claims or even the $3.5 billion Forbes claims by a significant fraction thereof) to stay in office. He refuses to and may have as a result precluded himself from the office.The 25th Amendment is designed to have a orderly transfer of power in case of presidential incapacity. Section 4 governs when the President refuses to admits his incapacity and allows for a majority of the cabinet plus the Vice President to remove him from office. While I think Trump is seriously mentally ill (or eccentric as they say when you are immensely rich), there is actually a bigger concern. Like his taxes, Trump “wrote” himself a doctor’s note (which no real doctor would have written) professing him to the healthiest candidate for President ever. Really, ever? Can he swim across the Potomac (Quincy Adams), can he chop firewood as a hobby (Reagan), serve in battle, sail by himself, or box (Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt)?We have no idea about this guy’s personal health. He could be a second scoop away from a heart attack and we would not know. Why is that a problem? Vice -presidential nominees are not elected separately from the President and with the exception of Alben Barkley, the Presidential nominee picks his own running mate. It’s hardly democratic. And when you throw in the fact that after it was announced that Pence would be Trump’s running mate, he asked if he could take it back. Less than 24 hours later. That’s a serious mental health problem.It’s a judgment call to say Trump lacks the capacity for office but when so many have documented so much that questions his capacity for office, it’s not much of leap of faith.",6.5k,204,1.4k,"1,049",0,1

Call Nancy Pelosi a hag a witch even Satan her self, but there is no denying she is one of the few people who can unite any caucus. This is where Paul Ryan fails. He does not have control over his caucus and continuously allows a small group to dictate policy that has no chance of ever passing of the senate.

The FBI launched an investigation. Trump took an oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. Why isn’t he doing everything in his power to support the FBI? Instead, he fired the FBI director and relentlessly casts aspersions on the characters, competence, and motives of the agents conducting the Russia investigation. Shame on Trump — and on the Congressional Republicans who have joined him in this crusade; they too, took an oath.Trump’s insecurities and fathomless ego will not allow him to consider that anything other than his own magnificence was responsible for his election victory.So let’s be clear — the president of the United States, for reasons of his own, is actively opposed to investigations into past and continuing attempts by a hostile foreign power to compromise America’s elections.

4,Are Democrats losing millennial support?,Millennial Generation,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"Haven’t we learned to analyze polls correctly after 2016? Did we learn NOTHING?The lessons we should take from 2016 - 1) polls are a snapshot. They are not written in stone. 2) Actual election results have to add up to 100%. Polls do not, leaving a huge amount of uncertainty. The uncertainty gap is why the polls in 2016 were interpreted incorrectly. Everyone looked at the gap, while ignoring that the undecided was more than the gap.Exit polls are by far the most accurate measure of who votes what way, since those surveys measure what people already did, just a few minutes before. There is much less margin of error there. Polls measure what people say they might do in the future.The Reuters survey is one poll, taken January-March 2018. The comparison the article uses to make its claim is to Reuters’ 2016 version of this poll, taken January-March. I will remind everyone that Bernie Sanders was riding high during that time, a serious threat to become the Democratic nominee. It was April/May of 2016 when he collapsed and Hillary clinched the nomination. So just keep in mind, the comparison is when Bernie Sanders was strong, and his popularity was overwhelmingly among young whites.So if we compare the 2016 Reuters poll to actual election results to the 2018 Reuters poll:Millennial Whites -2016 Reuters poll: Republicans 33, Democrats 47, don’t know/other 202016 actual results: Trump 50, Hillary 40, Other 10.2018 Reuters poll: Republicans 39, Democrats 39, don’t know/other 23All Millennials -2016 Reuters poll: Republicans 27, Democrats 55, don’t know/other 182016 actual results: Trump 37, Hillary 54, other 92018 Reuters poll: Republicans 28, Democrats 46, don’t know/other 26So we can read it different ways.Republicans can take heart that there is a 9 point shift way from Democrats and a 1 point shift toward Republicans in the poll 2016 vs 2018. There is a stronger shift among whites. If they can hold the undecided to split evenly… they might hold on to the House.Democrats can take heart in that the 2018 poll shows they have an 18 point head start with a huge well of votes still outstanding that could be won.To be honest, if I’m a Republican, I don’t like what I see because of that huge outstanding “don’t know” percentage in the 2018 Reuters poll. They were helped in 2016 by so many Millennials voting 3rd party and Bernie voters switching to Trump. They can’t count on that situation again. If the Democrats hold that 46% and add 11%, half of the undecided, - that is better than Clinton did. If they add more, then it’s Obama-style numbers. If Republicans only win what Trump did and there isn’t much 3rd party siphoning: we can add 10 points to their 28% - that’ll come out to something like Rep 38, Dem 59, Other 3. That would probably spell doom in the mid-terms this year unless off-set significantly by older voters… that result would be VERY similar to 2012. So they HAVE to win more Millennials than Trump did in 2016… they have to expand the field.The article is crowing about the white Millennial vote… okay guys - this was the white under-40 vote in 2012: Romney 55, Obama 41, Other 4. Trump underperformed that. He needs to do better.We’ll know more when there’s an actual election that we have exit polls for. None of the House special elections have had exit polls. What data we do have comes from VA and NJ gubernatorial elections and the Alabama senate special election in 2017. Democrats did better among the 18–29 demographic than they did even in 2008 in the same states.However, 2 of those 3 are blueish states, Alabama had unique circumstances, and Trump was at a nadir of his approval rate in Fall/Winter 2017.

I don’t know how changing from insurance paying the doctor for healthcare (sometimes) to government paying the doctor for healthcare (all the time) would suddenly make doctors incompetent. My firsthand experience and my informal asking around here in Norway is that the doctors are plenty competent. I’ve even gotten minor surgeries and I was very impressed. But the plural of anecdote isn’t data, and the data also suggests that there’s not a damned thing wrong with Norway’s medical system, considering our life spans are longer than that of the USA. So, got you beat on actual care, not just the affordability of it.They believe that this system will break the budget and we’ll become impoverished, no one can afford such a system, except of course for every other major industrialized nation on Earth. Those countries. It’s harder to name a country that doesn’t have such a system. And as for the budget, did you know that Norway runs at a surplus? We have no long term outstanding state debt and we are a trillion dollars to the good, we have a sovereign fund that we set aside each year from oil profits. Well, Daniel, Norway has oil. All the United States has is a massive film industry, a massive automotive industry, a massive TV producing industry, a huge software producing industry, and we’re the richest nation on Earth with more businesses and natural resources than any other, and oh yeah, we also produce almost as much oil as we use. Our imports are down and our production and refineries are up. So there’s obviously no way we can keep up with tiny Norway.You know why people believe the USA can’t do the same things as other countries?Because they believe that the standards set by almost every other country are too radical and outside of the mainstream, because we are too radical and outside of the mainstream. We believe in far far right economics as if it were a religious faith, and as soon as we come across a fact or an idea that contradicts it, we take it personally, and we reject it immediately as pure nonsense, because we Americans are egotistical, narcissistic, and believe we are number one at everything. Being the most powerful military, yes, being the largest single economy, yes, but our budget is busted, murders are out of control, mass shootings happen weekly, healthcare is unaffordable, unemployment is massive, under-employment is even more of an issue, we don’t have unions, our government is bought and paid for, and corporations are people, and money is speech, and money is the only way you’ll get a politician to listen. And we have insane people who value profits over people who are shitting on our education system and environmental laws and watchdog agencies as we speak.We allow this to happen because we’re deathly afraid of trying liberal ideas, and we are this way because we have 24 hours a day of talk radio, Fox News, televangelism, and cultural leaders in middle America constantly scaring people about how evil liberalism is and say it is literally a mental disorder.So we’ve become cowards and we won’t think for ourselves anymore. As long as the nice smiling man on TV says we’re moral and patriotic, they can keep taking away our pensions, healthcare, and government funded programs designed to keep the country running properly.The single greatest fraud perpetuated against the American people is to tell them that we’ve got the best everything on Earth, and to be satisfied with being ranked 126th in the world in terms of murder, among other low rankings.The fraud is that we’re number one, and if we’re not, we should ever be satisfied with that. I wish all these self-proclaimed patriots would join me in restoring the United States to the number one position, and all we really have to do is do what Americans do best: borrow the better ideas of people from all across the world.When the Germans abused their own people, we gave refuge to scientists that ended up making us the world’s only nuclear power. We used the brainpower of other countries to make us number one. We could use the brainpower of other nations who have already done the work demonstrating that single payer healthcare works. There’s no risk to us anymore.We call our states the laboratories of democracy. Well, other nations are democracies as well, and they have laboratories too. And we’re completely ignoring their data. That seems foolish to me.Use their data, use their ideas. We could make America great again, but we won’t ever do it by following a narcissistic delusional buffoon back to an authoritarian, isolationist, nationalistic past where ignorance and corruption reigned supreme. We fought ultra-partisan authoritarian nationalists (on the right) in world war 2 and almost came to nuclear blows with them (on the left) in the Cold War. Let’s not embrace their failed ideas.Left or right, Authoritarian Nationalism is a dead idea. Bury it forever like the great big giant steaming pile of SHIT that it is.",249,8,717,"2,216",0,0

While I will concede that the majority of Republicans dragging their feet in regards to climate change policy is in opposition to most of the science out there, conservative are not along in supporting policies that do not reflect scientific consensus or even devising new studies to reflect their politics.While most of the scientific community is looking for a trace element of life on another planet even at the cellular level, liberals (in the name of feminism) frequently deny the right to life to children at conception. They refuse to call a fetus a small child (even though fetus means small child in Latin) and deny its personhood.They also deny the science of genetics insofar as it benefits their conception of gender. There is no biological science that points to more than two genders except in rare mutations. From sociological and psychological standpoints there are many deviations from the two biological genders but they should be considered unhealthy delusions and should have support in correcting their errors rather than entertaining them especially in small children. Pedophilia also occurs on a psychological level but should not be encourage and supported either.I think anything that denies basic realities in order support an agenda is inherently dangerous to the construct of civilization. No more should I be able to claim I am a woman and have special status conferred to me (bathroom privileges, scholarships, etc.) than should I be able to claim I am a veteran or a senior citizen.

5,"Why is so simple an idea as race not mandating political affiliation considered ""unthinkable""?",Political Affiliation,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"In the 1940’s there was something developed called the ‘hierarchy of needs’. The basic idea is that first you have physiological needs met, and once all of those needs are met, then safety. Safety is followed by community, esteem, etc. The main idea is that all of your needs at one level must be met before you even worry about the next level. You don’t worry about retirement planning if you can’t afford to feed yourself today. You don’t worry about traffic if you are unemployed without a car. You don’t worry about higher level issues until lower ones are addressed.In 1964, Barry Goldwater was the Republican nominee for president. Though he was not racist, he made it clear that he placed the text and spirit of the 10th amendment above the text and spirit of the 14th. For this reason, he opposed the civil rights act, and for all intents the civil rights movement. For Goldwater, this was certainly a principled stance from a man who wasn’t racist. However, during that election blacks understandably believed that Goldwater and other Republicans who agreed with him didn’t like us. ‘States rights’ became and remains coded language for many blacks that is as clear as the confederate flags that made a resurgence in the 60’s as well.In the intervening years, the GOP never made the case that they like us. In 2016, Trump did well amongst white evangelicals. Not because he is/was religious. He did well because he convinced them that he liked them and would fight for them. Similar in the great lakes states. He convinced rural whites in the great lakes that he would fight to bring back jobs that realistically aren’t going to come back. But he liked them. For blacks? He called our communities war zones. He’s called our athletes sons of bitches. In the black community birtherism is/was seen as racist. Trump may not have said any racial epithets, but he made clear who he does and does not like.Before I can vote for someone, I need to like the guy and feel like at the least he doesn’t dislike me. I need to be liked and respected before I can worry about issues like taxes and foreign policy. I’d rather work for less money for a good boss than make double the money at a guy who likes to talk about the good aspects of Jim Crow. DJT could pass legislation giving me personally a free car and I still couldn’t vote for a guy who doesn’t like me. However, the civil rights era is gone. I can attend any school, shop at any business, and get any job (including president). There is no legislation to make Trump or anyone else to like me - and such laws would be unconstitutional.This is where black Republicans come in. Black Republicans feel that the lower level of needs have been met and then they worry about the nitty gritty of policies. That isn’t to say that blacks on the left don’t know or care about policy. We do. However, we often try to look at underlying reasons for it. Voter ID would have 100% support in the black community if the people behind it weren’t doing it to get ‘some people’ to vote less. Border wall? We’d build it ourselves if it was going along the northern border.You may or may not know this, but there is a wide and varied community of black media. These outlets obviously cover politics - especially during election time. One thing you find is that there isn’t actually a lot of support for Democrats. You found very few articles in 2016 that were positive about Hillary that weren’t written by someone associated with the campaign. You also don’t find a lot of articles critical of conservatism. The coverage was uniformly negative of self-described conservatives. It wasn’t yes Hillary, it was no Trump. Trump believes certain minorities can’t do their job. Trump thinks the best surgeon in Africa is worse than a Norwegian barber. Trump’s solution to help Chicago crime is a patronizing lecture and fewer constitutional freedoms. Trump looks at a video of a black man getting shot and screams how the police are under attack. Black Republicans often look past the man and look at his proposals and actions.

5,"Why is so simple an idea as race not mandating political affiliation considered ""unthinkable""?",Political Affiliation,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"Because, historically, one party has catered to various racial demographics, and the other has not. People tend to elect those that cater to them.Black people, for example, are currently catered to by the Democratic party. They are listened to, their concerns are validated, and when an issue specific to race comes up (police brutality against black people, for example), Democrats generally take their side. Whether they do this for altruistic reasons or just to get votes is up for debate, of course.By comparison, the Republican party is led by a President that caters to (or at the very least, avoids stepping on the toes of) white supremecists, who are enemies of any non-white race.For a black person to 'cross the divide' and vote for a Republican, they have to say, ""All of these concerns that are unique to the black community are not important to me. Instead, I care about {insert Republican cause here, such as taxes, homosexuality, or abortion}."" Other black people often see this as a betrayal, and think the 'traitor' is being selfish for minimizing their concerns.Either that, or the black person has been swayed by faulty arguments, and needs to be better informed. For example, when Kanye West started talking about how Republicans are the party that freed the slaves and Democrats are the party of the KKK, someone had to tell him about the Southern Strategy, and how slavery and racism were not linked primarily to party but were instead a product of the South -- the same South that switched their party affiliations en masse from Democrat to Republican roughly 50 years ago.So while race doesn't mandate party affiliation, voting for politicians that ignore or actively attack your race is seen by many as misguided. At best, it's grounded in ignorance. At worst, it means believing that the problems other members of your race experience don't apply to you, and that you don't care about (or believe) those other people.",186,7,79,371,0,0

4,Are Democrats going to lose the Senate race in 2018?,U.S. Senate,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"Are Democrats going to lose the Senate race in 2018?If the question actually means, “After the 2018 elections, are Democrats likely to have fewer senate seats than the 47 they hold today?”, then the answer is “probably”.Democrats own 47 seats today and influence two additional seats held by independents, for a nominal total of 49. 23 Democratic senate seats and both independent seats are up for re election, which makes a nominal total of 25 “Democrat” seats up for grabs.In contrast, just 8 of 51 Republican senate seats are up for grabs in 2018.In mathematical terms, Democrats have three times the risk Republicans have, while conventional political calculus holds that the senate typically remains about the same, with either party picking up one or two seats.However, conventional political calculus is on the wane. For about thirty-eight years, corporate politician buyers and wealthy individual politician buyers have used Biblical propaganda and nationalist propaganda to spook white trash into voting against their own interests, which has resulted in Republican backers looting the US Treasury, beginning with tripling the national debt during eight years of peace time, 1980–1988, and peaking with Bush43’s profiteer promoting debacles including but not limited to war mongering in the middle east and paying off the criminals who crashed the US economy in 2008.In the same period, Democrats abandoned the blue collar middle class that made them America’s majority party from 1932 until the 1990s. Dismissing the blue collar middle class as vulgar, uneducated, and unworthy, Democrats actively campaigned to become the party of outliers under the mantle of diversity. The result is the best Democrats can hope for under present management is that Republicans fail (see, Bush 41; see Bush 43; see, McCain campaign; see, Romney campaign).Given that Trump’s open support typically runs 35% to 40%, it is my belief that at least half that many people silently feel some level of support for Trump, which is to say that somewhere between 50% and 60% of American voters are at worst on the fence about Trump. If that is true and Trump doesn’t get caught with a dead woman or a live boy, then Trump’s open bellicosity toward major media and “business as usual” button-down hacks in Washington and around the US will have coattails that lead to a successful election season for Republicans.Add to that the recent missteps by Democrats publicly and unapologetically putting the prospects of illegal aliens ahead of prospects for US citizens, especially blue collar middle class US citizens, and my calculus suggests Democrats seem likely to lose four or five seats out of the 23 registered Democratic seats up for grabs in 2018.On an even more speculative editorial note, it is my opinion that corporations and wealthy individuals finance Democrats to keep a closely held opposition party in business; and that further, corporations in particular encourage the nuttier elements of the Democratic Party platform (promoting illegal immigration, promoting divisive identity politics, aggrandizing self serving government unions) specifically for the purpose of increasing polarization in US politics, which contrary to CNN and MSNBC tabloid journalists’ claims, absolutely increases the power of concentrated money used against the long term prospects of what was once called “the American Dream”.",152,4,16,447,0,0

2,Why do Democrats and Republicans get so many votes compared to other parties?,Democratic Party vs. Republican Party,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Because that's the way 'first past the post' voting is designed.First past the post is when you have everyone vote, and whoever gets the most votes wins. This is the most simplistic voting method, but it is fraught with problems when it comes to serious, democratic elections.Under such a system, it is against your best interest to vote for anything but the two candidates most likely to win. Why? Because if you vote for the third (or lower) place winner, that means that you helped the person you like the LEAST by not voting for their most viable opponent. This is why voting for a third party is often called 'throwing your vote away'.Is it possible for third parties to win? In theory, but it's not likely. This is because they need to build up enough to support their win in just ONE election cycle. Because if it takes them more than one cycle to garner up support, everyone who voted them in the first election cycle -- and saw the person they most hate elected as a result -- will change their votes to a more viable candidate.And guess what happened in the rare instances where a third party did win. Whoever came in third place in that election dropped off the map completely, and we were down to two parties again.There are other systems that give people more freedom to vote for a third party without worrying about it ensuring they help out the person they hate the most. For example, systems where you rank your preferences, and if your top preference is in last place, your vote gets moved to your second-place pick.Until we change our voting system to something besides first past the post, we are going to be stuck in a two party system.

The question is what standard do you use to say the injury you do one is justified by the benefit you do the other? Liberals tend to use some rough version of utilitarianism, conservatives tend to stand on principles of individual liberty.You can see this clearly in the debate on gun restriction. Liberals tend to argue that restricting guns would reduce deaths overall and conservatives that individuals have a right to defend themselves whether it results in lower murder statistics or not.

The Taft wing was conservative and the Rockefeller wing was more moderate.Enter Barry Goldwater and the Young Americans for Freedom. While they successfully reconciled the two foreign policy philosophies by embracing the “threat of international communism”, Goldwater and the YAFers questioned the very notion of governance by attacking the notion of judicial review, tax expenditures, government spending, the constitutionality of the Federal Reserve, etc. Over the next 25 years, the grip of the YAFers and hard right conservatives like Goldwater destroyed the Rockefeller wing.The biggest effect brought about by the YAFers was not hard core right wing 20 year old college students, it was that by 1978 most College Republican campus groups went from basically libertarian organizations into Hayek/Buckley/Birch type groups.In 1976, Ford's biggest struggle was that the young Nixonites who once represented the future of the GOP were supplanted by Reaganauts or Reaganites and his primary battle with Reagan was telling on an age scale with the direction of the party.The 1963 document reads like a water downed version of the Democrats on social and economic policy and has a decidedly interventionist viewpoint on foreign policy.The 1979 document questions the existence of every federal program as well as many cabinet departments, it reads like a Federalist Society diatribe on the Judiciary, and Keynesian economics is dead.

However, the thresholds have not been adjusted to keep up with inflation. On the contrary, the cow has been milked harder. In 1993 an amendment added a secondary threshold of $35,000, and for those with an AGI in excess of this secondary threshold, the portion of social security income subject to tax was raised from 50% to 85%. At that time, about 18% of social security recipients had some tax liability. The amendments did not increase the percentage of retirees subject to the tax, but it did increase the percentage that many of them had to pay.Since 1993, the threshold has not been raised further and inflation has brought the majority of retirees into the tax net at the highest rate.Social Security History",129,6,2.6k,"6,627",0,1

This party first merged with the Eastern CDU and then with the Western CDU. Merkel first ran for a seat in the German national parliament (Bundestag) in 1990.

He promoted her into his administration in 1991, she became secretary of women and children, probably the least influential secretary available. Her next term was in 1994, when Kohl wanted to get rid of the acting secretary for enviromental protection and nuclear safety. In 1998 the CDU lost the elections.During that time the CDU was shattered by scandals, and Merkel became leader of the party because she was the only one with a flawless reputation.It took her seven years in opposition until she became Federal Chancellor of Germany in 2005, and she succeded to keep this position until today. This is a combination from her talent to stay away from scandals and the lack of people charismatic enough to replace her. But this has close to nothing to do with the German Reunition.

1,Should Democrats be blamed for the creation of the KKK?,Ku Klux Klan,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"Question: “Should Democrats be blamed for the creation of the KKK?”Yes and no.The Democratic party of the 1800s should be blamed for it. Back then they were conservative, particularly in the South. The Southerners were still very upset at losing the war and wanted to keep the pressure on blacks by terrorizing them and denying their basic rights. Hence the Klan and the Jim Crow laws.In the mid 1900s the two parties had a realignment, a switch. It had been brewing for a while. In 1948 the Southern conservative Democrats left the party to form the Dixiecrat party. That effort failed and they returned to the Democratic party. But the rift was still there.In the early 60s the conservatives were getting awfully tired of being in a party with liberals. When Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act they had enough and voted for Barry Goldwater. He lost. Richard Nixon saw an opportunity and created his “Southern Strategy” around it. He wooed the conservatives away from the Democratic party and they’ve been leaving ever since.Today the Republican party is conservative, extremely so, and the Democratic party is liberal.

After winning his home state by the skin of his teeth, Johnson saw the writing was on the wall and the racism that had carried Texas for generations would no longer work anymore. The younger generation just was not as racist. That is why Johnson supported the Civil Rights Act of 1964. He realized that African American Texans voted for him more reliably that did white Texans so it was time to encourage African Americans to vote, since they would now be voting “correctly.”Source:United States presidential election in Texas, 1960 - WikipediaUnited States presidential election in Texas, 2016 - WikipediaFast Forward 56 years and we now have a Republican Texas.

Because of the Civil Rights Act and the onset of the GOP ‘Southern Strategy,’ virtually all Southern Democrats became Republicans, and all Southern Republicans became Democrats. The ‘Southern Democrats’ (also referred to as ‘Dixiecrats’) truly were quite different in outlook from the Northern Democrats, and the changes in Party platforms over the last fifty years for BOTH the Republicans and the Democrats have resulted in an almost complete transposition of the two. The PEOPLE and their attitudes have not changed, but the parties most certainly have, and that is why today the South is mostly deep red, when fifty years ago it was deep blue.

2,Weren't the Democrats pro-slavery during the Civil War? I know it doesn't affect the issues now at all (policy shifts) but I am just curious.,Historical Civil Wars,U.S. Civil War,1!,1!,1!,1!,"The Democrats and the Republicans have pretty much totally switched roles since the civil war. The Democrats in that time period represented big business and banking. They were urban and mostly lived in the North. So actually they did not want the South to secede They needed the raw materials grown on plantations to help run their factories and make products to sell. If the South seceded, the prices for those materials would surely go up, and the manufacturers did not want that. But they were not entirely comfortable with the use of slaves, either.Republicans were more rural. They worked the land, owned or rented land, and sold crops, lumber, and other raw materials to the industrialists in the North. They also lived in the north just as some Democrats lived in the South.The Southerners felt they needed slaves to get all the field work done by winter—they owned lots of land or worked lots of land—and did need help. But they had been dependent upon slave-labor for a long time, and really did not know how they could afford to hire the amount of laborers they needed for the growing season.There was no modern farm equipment back then—all the planting, weeding, and harvest were done by hand. They felt their economy would take a nose-dive if they could not get their crops in to sell or their wood shipped in quantity to the north.They also wanted new states (they were still territories) being established west of the Mississippi should be allowed to be slave-holding states. If more slave-holding states were in existence, the ‘old’ southern land-owners would no longer be in the minority during elections and could keep slaves.So Republicans in the South tended to be pro-slavery and the Democrats in the North tended to be against slavery, but they wanted to make big money with the help of the South.The Democrats were hypocritical in their thinking. “Get rid of slavery down i the south, but don’t make me lose money when they are freed, and do not secede from the union! And don’t send the former slaves up north!” They also did not believe that the African-Americans should have the same rights as the white Americans. So they were sympathetic in public and racist in private. Freeing slaves was fine—at a distance.Almost all Northerners were racist, even though they didn’t like slavery. They did not believe that former slaves could make intelligent decisions. They stereotyped the slaves as lazy, shiftless, wild, dangerous, stupid, and and unclean. But lots of those ideas would not be seen until after the war was over.Today we see the Republicans as business owners, corporation owners, urban, and wealthy. (Stereotyping again) We see Democrats as the ‘common man’, the poor, the hard-workers, the middle class,, the farmers, the workers of land, and the ‘humane’ party at times.

And what do you mean by “support?”If you’re talking about the South, every white person was pro-slavery, with trivial exceptions.In the North, the Democrats were generally against making the elimination of slavery a war goal. But so were most Republicans, at the start. The decision to end slavery came almost entirely as a war measure, something that would hurt the Rebels and help the Union, and didn’t become Republican conviction till about the middle of 1862.Most Democratic politicians opposed the idea, claiming that the attempt would lengthen the war. And the cold political fact was that the voters most opposed to freeing slaves were mostly Democrats. Border state slaveholders, unskilled immigrant laborers worried about competition from free blacks, transplanted Southerners in the Border North, they were all for keeping slavery going in the South. The Democrats elected from those areas had to go along.Other Democrats seem to have opposed ending slavery because it came from a Republican administration.But almost all Northern Democrats were opposed to the extremes Southern Democrats supported before the war, such as the idea that all territories had to be open to slavery. So the Democratic position was more ‘restore the status quo ante’, rather than ‘Slavery is a good thing.’So the Northern Democrats were less opposed to slavery than the Republicans, but not enthusiastic supporters.",55,0,40,"1,158",0,0

The Democrats were very much a part of the pro-slavery movement. They were also behind segregation and Jim Crow laws. And while many Democrats are quick to point out that the civil rights movement was championed during Johnson’s watch, I think it is worth looking at the voting record behind the divil rights act of 1964 (driven by a Republican controled Congress.)The historical spin of the Democratic party often defies logic (and certainly reality). They would have us believe that THEY are the party which champions the People’s causes. In reality, they have done more to burden the American people by way of tax and spending than any party in American history.When looking at the accomplishments of each party (or their failures) one cannot simply look at who is in the whitehouse. Do your homework and look at how Congress was divided and who wielded power. The story becomes much more consistent.I am not a Republican. In fact, I am pretty disillusioned with our 2 party system. I think it is broken. But nothing points to the brokenness of the system better than the Democratic Party from the mid 20th Century to present. Looking at the way the DNC effectively stole (or at least set aside) the Democratic primary for Hillary Clinton is an indication of how broken the system is.As for current politics, there is one very consistent thread between the early Democratic Party and the present - the Democrats believe government to be the solution to everything. There is an inherent belief that it is Government that provides a “level playing field” for everyone. The problem with this is that in order to accomplish this it requires the Government itself to play a bigger part in the lives and livelyhood of the people.The slavery/segregation issues, however, are really the only times I can think (off the top of my head) where the Democrats opposed government intrusion. Look up “Dixiecrats” on Bing or Google.I freely admit I am being a bit broad in the painting of policies (due to time and physical constraints) but it isn’t an inaccurate overview. Yes, they had Kennedy (whom I genuinely appreciate), but they also had FDR, Johnson, and Obama. But the real people you need to look at in terms of laws and legislation are the members of Congress.

The Democratic party fractured during their convention and ended up holding a second convention. Northern Democrats and Southern Democrats. The Northern faction favored a state's rights policy on slavery called popular sovereignty. The Southern Democrats were strongly pro-slavery. The Northern Democrats under Stephan Douglas pulled the second highest popular vote, after Lincoln, but only won the electors from one state, Missouri and in spite of large popular support finished in last place.It is interesting to note, at that time there was no secret balloting in the presidential elections. Each party printed their own ballots which voters placed in the ballot boxes so everyone knew who voted for who. This resulted in huge social pressure in regional voting. At that time people were very aware that they were voting for electors as opposed to voting directly for a particular candidate.In any event saying that all democrats were pro-slavery doesn't accurately reflect conditions.

They get their news from professional conspiracy theorists, like Alex Jones, and internet frauds.These theories range from 9/11 being an inside job to deep state conspiracies about who chooses the President.

On the extreme left, you have those convinced that politicians and large corporations are systematically working to enslave the poor and middle class.If only it was all that simple: if there was one group of good guys vs one group of bad guys.

1,"Politics is best described as a sophisticated game where organized groups of people fight for power, based on their common economic interests. How do I understand those of the Democrat/Liberal/Leftist?",Economic Policy,Democratic Party (US politics),Politics,1!,1!,1!,"As others have pointed out already, the “American left” tend to focus on society over the individual. The general rule of thumb is that an individual will benefit more from interactions with a “stable” or “growing” society than they would from “individual” legislation. We tend to base this theory off of similar occurrences seen in the observable reality.An example would be: Networking.In the business/career “world”, we often see those that worked on their “social/business circles” will often go further than those with “better” credentials. This is often due to corporations not only looking for technical skills and knowledge, but also the ability to work well in a group or social setting. If your “social circle” is well-developed, then you will more likely come across more frequent and “better” career opportunities.This concept can be expanded further into “social standing”, “survivability”, and other psych/sociological theories; but that’s for another discussion.Another underlying theme I have noticed through discussions (a preliminary “theory”), is a distinction in problem-solving. The right-leaning side tend to be more direct and concrete when approaching a problem or a piece of legislation. The left-leaning side are often more abstract in interpretation of a dilemma.Each “style” has positives and negatives. The right side can often come to an agreement on legislation quicker (more votes), simply due to the ability to “compartmentalize” legislation. Short-term effects are superior to long-term- out of a belief that “new” legislation can always be introduced at a later time to correct any unforeseen side-effects. This is often capitalized on by the Left- “poor legislation by greedy Republicans” (insert “Schumer outrage statement of the day” at this time).This runs counter to the Left, where unanimous agreements are harder to come by at times. New legislation is “murky”, and might have dramatically effect different subsets of society. This “variable” has to be weighed short-term versus the long haul, as often corrections down the line are more expensive, less effective, or may be misunderstood by a disaffected group. Often, this predicament can slow down legislation, or sabotage the message entirely- Democratic legislation often requires an intricate “web” of processes to work in unison for a desired effect. The right can “snipe” specific parts of legislation making the total package much less effective (insert Ryan’s “fiscal responsibility” quote of the day here).One final point would be the voter base and geography”. The Left tends to draw support from urban, liberal areas along with the “Lion’s share” of contemporary media “culture”. In these locations, government assistance is often pretty good and efficient (cost of logistics are quite cheap in dense populations). Often basic infrastructure is also “maintained” to a sizable degree out of necessity.The Right’s “voter base” (before Trump anyway..) tended to reside in smaller, often semi-rural communities. Government assistance is often less efficient (everything is spread out), and “less funded” (less corporate/government native infrastructure). This is often offset by (especially in the Southern US), a tendency for religious and close-knit private institutions to “step in” and help maintain local communities.Hope that helps.",131,1,92,260,0,0

But, out of the terrific Reader’s manifesto he links to as an example parallel to politics (read that too btw), one sentence struck me, not as a definition of “populism” itself, but rather as a metaphor for the slightly unnatural situations that allow the very phenomenon of populism to exist and to be necessary:A thriller must thrill or it is worthless; this is as true now as it ever was. […][Whereas] many critically acclaimed novels today are no more than mediocre “genre” stories told in a conformist amalgam of approved “literary” styles.Populism, in short, is a rebellion against self-appointed gatekeepers in assorted areas of intellectual and social life, which is no news. But there’s something about the mechanics of this, and, more tellingly, about the specific civilizational conditions that make the whole thing possible in the first place (for all accusations of “strongman worship”, populism cannot exist within tyrannies, as well as within healthy Republicanism or Minarchism).It just reminds me too much of what Orwell wrote in his Theory and practice of oligarchical collectivism (the book-within-the-book from 1984, and a fantastic essay in its own right):“So long as defeat meant the loss of independence, or some other result generally held to be undesirable, the precautions against defeat had to be serious.Physical facts could not be ignored. In philosophy, or religion, or ethics, or politics, two and two might make five, but when one was designing a gun or an airplane they had to make four. Inefficient nations were always conquered sooner or later, and the struggle for efficiency was inimical to illusions.Moreover, to be efficient it was necessary to be able to learn from the past, which meant having a fairly accurate idea of what had happened in the past.Newspapers and history books were, of course, always colored and biased, but falsification of the kind that is practiced today would have been impossible. War was a sure safeguard of sanity, and so far as the ruling classes were concerned it was probably the most important of all safeguards.While wars could be won or lost, no ruling class could be completely irresponsible.”This predicament might remind you of postwar Europe, or perhaps of what Sallust called the end of metus hostilis (“fear of the enemy”) — ie. the day Rome wiped the last competitor of her size (Carthage) from the map, and it became clear that future defeats would risk bringing about setbacks, but not the threat of annihilation ever again.And it is pretty funny to recall that I was first made aware of this phenomenon of “forcing a reckoning with reality”, which is now coalescing into populism (for the energy itself has long been there, untapped), from an argument made by Classics scholar Luciano Canfora, who similarly labeled philology — one of the most highbrow disciplines in existence — a cultural canary in the coal mine, a guarantor of truthfulness because of its own strict logical requirements.Just translate political Populism to its cultural parallels (as almost all self-labeled Populists do as a first step), and then try commenting on the political/cultural/academic/entertainment establishment’s shrieks and wailings on how the unwashed masses shall undo our precious, perfect Democracy. This culture-politics conversibility is pretty interesting and also holds true for anti-populists:All things considered, it’s quite a pedigree for what is labeled by its enemies as a mere synonym for “demagoguery” (the two are opposites, in fact). Let me close with one last quote from the above literary article — and again, something that holds as true for established literature as it does for politics, ideology and so-called “entertainment”:You could study that passage all day and find no trace of a flair for words. Many readers, however, including the folks at Granta, are willing to buy into the scam that anything this dull must be Serious and therefore Fine and therefore Beautiful Writing.",803,33,560,116,0,3
3,"Is the term “populist” applied to someone because they express the views of a democratic majority, just a way of denigrating perfectly valid widely-held views disliked by elitist snobs?",Populism,Democratic Party vs. Republican Party,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Yes, at least in terms of the recent “populist” wave.You’ll see no end of hand-wringing in American media about the dreaded populist wave, and all the populist politicians and populist ideas and evil populists who are going to destroy democracy with their populism (huh?) and so on. And if you read some of the more fru-fru literary rags, you’ll notice the word “populist” being used as a quasi-polite designator for anything that originates outside of, or that tends to work against the interests of, the ruling class. In the literary world, we have A Reader's Manifesto by B.R. Myers, which points out some of the problems in contemporary literary fiction; this was, of course, derided as “populist” in a rebuttal published in the New York Times. Notice the pattern here, in that any criticism of established institutions and ways of thinking gets the populist label and is thus delegitimized.In politics, populism is used in a similar way. The word is a kind of smoke signal used by the bourgeoisie to tell one another that it’s time to circle the wagons. Donald Trump, despite being a billionaire and thus a member of the ruling class himself, is a “populist” candidate because he wasn’t approved by the string-pullers in either major party. If you’re wondering why the media hates him, this is why. It has nothing to do with him being an evil disgusting sexist pig (Bill Clinton gets a pass on that) or with being “racist” (John McCain got away with calling Asian people “gooks” for the longest time) or anything else of the sort. He wasn’t approved by the right people, so the media craps on him, and that’s the long and short of it.The reason that you hear the term constantly now is because, 25 years too late, established institutions have finally realized that the internet exists and can be used to spread ideas. The internet is largely responsible for the so-called populist wave because it allows people to communicate outside of approved channels. I don’t necessarily have to believe that I’ve gotten the full story from cable news on the events in Korea, for example, because I can fire up my computer and find a South Korean to talk to in about 30 minutes. Basically, the advent of the internet has broken the monopoly that academia, media, and government once had on information. The breaking of this monopoly also makes it much more difficult to manufacture a consensus. Even worse, the internet is profitable, which means that too many people who would otherwise want to reverse this process cannot do so because they have money tied up in it.The end result is highly amusing. The talking heads with a hair plugs and capped teeth on news networks and self-consciously literary journalists are bleating about populism at every opportunity. It won’t work, of course. To understand why it won’t work, you should probably subscribe to my YouTube channel. ;-)",1.9k,38,3.4k,"1,389",0,2

Definition of Terms:Populist - Definition #1: “a member or adherent of a political party seeking to represent the interests of ordinary people.”However, the term is much more complicated these days. The BBC in March had an article referring to Cas Mudde, author of Populism: A Very Short Introduction, which defines Populism as “the pure people” as opposed to “the corporate elite”. Another author, Benjamin Moffitt, says that the true populist leaders claims to represent the “will of the people”, aimed at “draining the swamp” or tackling the “liberal elite”. In this last version, Populism tens to associate itself with the political Right, (even the “Radical Right” according to Mudde) which is the opposite of what it was in the past, with socialism, etc. Current politicians ""like Marine Le Pen in France, Viktor Orbán in Hungary, and Donald Trump in the US, combine populism with [anti-immigrant] nativism and authoritarianism,"" Mudde added. Another author, Nadia Urbinati from Columbia University says: ""A populist leader who gets into power is 'forced' to be in a permanent campaign to convince his people that he is not establishment - and never will be."" She argues that populist content is ""made of negatives - whether it is anti-politics, anti-intellectualism, or anti-elite. Here lies one of the populism's strengths - it is versatile.”Democratic majority: with the most votes.elitist: Definition #1 “the choice or best of anything, as a group or class of persons”. #2: “A group of persons exercisting the major share of authority or influence within a larger group”.snob: “a person with an exaggerated respect for high social position or wealth, who dislikes people or activities regarded as lower-class.”I think the answer to your question is that “Populist” does not mean what it once did, and instead has become associated with authoritarianism and anti-immigrant nativism. Our current leaders may or may not reflect the will of the Democratic Majority - in fact in the U.S., Hillary Clinton won the popular vote, though, Trump won by the rules of the electoral college.So, if you consider as perfectly valid some of the negative and nativist views of some of the current Populists, I suppose you would think anyone who disagrees with them as as someone who thinks they are better (and therefore an elitist snob). Though for the life of me, I don’t understand that. If the voting public thinks they are correct, why would they feel threatened by another group who thinks the second group is correct?I think the true majority of Democratic voters may feel threatened by all of the new technologies (even as they make use of them), and believe the Populist Leaders who blame the changes in economy on immigrants, intellectuals, and others. Hopefully there are other views that they have that are not mutually exclusive with the rest of the country, like good public education, roads, libraries, jobs, investment in science to create cell phones and the internet, etc.",126,2,25,278,0,0

There are also emoluments clause violations.Trump also appears to have bribed public officials in the past and a variety of other crimes.That said - why people believe stuff doesn’t necessarily have any basis in reality - while all of the above are true, most people have only vague ideas of what the facts are and are likely responding to their gut belief rather than rational analysis of the accumulating evidence.",154,6,3.9k,"3,643",0,0

Scientists are generally apolitical because they fear losing funding and academic appointments but Trump's exploitation of ignorance was just too much to take.

As an American I’d push for a better free trade agreement and maybe even open immigration between the two countries long before I’d push for just joining completely.Just think of all the little ways that Canada is different from even liberal border states.

Canada is a great country, but I don’t see an overriding reason why the US states would need to join up with Canada.

You are getting at best grudging compliance to the letter of the law, but the negative impacts are far greater and more wide-ranging than you can imagine.Progressives see this with War on Drugs, or War on Terror, but they don’t recognize this with their own Wars.Why should scientific inquiry of IQ across ethnicities be permitted?Bound to BackfireThe election of Trump should have given progressives notice.The more they centralize violent power over others, the more attractive that power is to people who mean harm, and the easier it is to capture that power.Sure, it seems like a great idea while your team is controlling the violence. Everyone has to obey your every command or else your rulers will hurt them.And the great part is that you don’t even have to use that violence that much. Most people just submit instead of being fined, beaten, caged, maimed or murdered. And so this seems like the perfect way to Rule the World and to make everything right and good and fine, as you’ve always dreamed it could be.But in just one election cycle, that power that you centralized can be captured by someone whom you don’t like, or worse, who hates you.Now all of a sudden, you will be the one who either obeys or dies.The history of the 1900s shows that rulers kill twice as many of their own people than they’ll kill foreign peoples in war.

6,"Libertarians, what do you most wish progressives/statists would understand?",Progressive Political Movement,Progressivism,1!,1!,1!,1!,"My wish would be that they understood:It is illogical to say the source of a problem (poor government), can be the same as the solution to the problem (more poor government).You can’t decry mass incarceration and still want to boss people around. If you want to make folks do what you want, there must be sanctions for when they “disobey.” If you want to deny people cigarettes, Eric Garner is what it looks like. If you want people to only go to jail as a last resort, congratulations, you’re a Libertarian.Prosperity is achieved through cooperation. Statist solutions are always zero sum, where the winner of a political struggle really is taking away something from the loser of a political struggle. People will not long cooperate peacefully if they loose a political struggle. In free economics, trade is a win win, and people are far more inclined to peacefully cooperate with each other. There is a reason why statist governments result in the worst corruption, the most inner conflict, and the least cooperation. This is the reason why free countries don’t war on each other.Any government powerful enough to give you everything you want is also powerful enough to take away whatever you have (and history shows it’s far more of the later than the former). Obama’s “gifts” of yesterday can be taken by Trump tomorrow. Power given to Obama, (taken, sometimes) is now wielded by Trump. Approve no political weapon you don’t want to see in your enemy’s hands next election cycle.Government rarely adapts and never innovates, anywhere in the world (ever, ever, ever).You are on the road to giving the government the power to determine whether your headache should warrant a CT scan, yet the government is unable to run a Post Office. Give yourself that headache wondering why your job involves risks and consequences, while you swerve to avoid the same pothole you paid the government to fix for months, and there are no risks or consequences to them. This is the system you want to run more things. In the normal course of human affairs, when you run small things poorly, you are not given more, and bigger, and more complex things, to run. This principal is even found in the Bible (the parable of the good steward).Most human progress is technological, economic and cultural. These processes are evolutionary, and don’t respond to you forcing them on your schedule. Very rarely does politics have the power to improve the lot of man.There is a reason why rights-respecting nations are rich. And wealth brings options better able to solve the problems of racism and sexism. Wealth makes it easier to solve the problems of pollution, war, premature death, healthcare and malnutrition (most problems really).Whatever programs you want money for must come from a wealth-producing economy. There must be a pie big enough for you to divvy. Smaller slices of a bigger pie are politically more manageable than bigger slices from a smaller economic pie. So, abstract rights must be seen to emanate from concrete wealth. This is why theoretical rights in the USSR only yielded theoretical bread for them to eat. Talk all you like about the right to healthcare, or the right to a micro-aggression free workplace, but these cannot happen without the money to make them happen, which comes from a functional economy. North Korea might claim their people have more right to healthcare than North Dakota, but whose people actually get more healthcare?There is a reason why no rule of law, human-rights respecting nation has ever been able to legally define equality well enough for the law to remain lawful. The concept is utterly subjective, and so cannot be made into real law. Granting a government the power to act to create equality is giving them the power to act according to political caprice. There is a reason why the greatest damage inflicted on people in history was done by governments chasing this ghost (demon, really).It’s hard to know things, and the governments’ claims to expertise are false, because government has no good mechanisms for knowing things, and cannot adapt when they do: the EU was designed by experts, requiring the people to trust in their expertise. They designed a system lacking resilience to the point that Greece, an economy representing <2% of the whole, regularly threatens to undo the whole project. And there is no way to adapt to change this reality. They are locked in, with no way back. This not knowing, and having poor tools to find out, gave us the mistake of the Iraq invasion (and we did the same thing again to Libya as a fun bonus!).Most of what government “knows” is what lobbyists tell them to know.Rarely does government actually, objectively, study a problem, without being paid by some interest to find the solution that is to their advantage.This problem of not knowing and not wanting to find out is how America gets the world’s highest incarceration rate, jailing mostly the chemically depended/mentally ill, without ever asking how drug addiction and mental illness can be deterred by incarceration. We can’t see, don’t want to know, that every other nation on earth has addressed this self same problem without mass incarceration. Yet here the status quo is locked.Most people and companies make their decisions based on trial and error (an evolutionary approach to knowing and finding out), yet we have a welfare system that has decimated the family structures of those we are trying to help, without ever exploring alternatives or adjustments. For government, trial and error is stunted, if not impossible. Knowledge is evolutionary.The Facebook hearings on Capitol Hill is the way things work normally, with the embarrassing contrast of arrogance of power with, at the same time, displays of compete ignorance (just like how hardly anyone who voted for the Iraq war actually read the briefings).The appeals to the Facebook owner for help in contolling his own business is the same incumbent-driven process government uses to regulate America’s healthcare industry, banking industry, and everything else. “Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain!”Freedom is more than man’s most powerful buttress against the failures listed above.

Libertarians want to leave progressives and statists and everyone else alone to think what they want.Moreover, everyone understands the two things libertarians stand for—to leave people alone to do what they want if it doesn’t hurt anyone else, and never to initiate violence against an innocent. Few people disagree with these things, but most think they have to be sacrificed at times for more important principles. They treat libertarians like pacifists or people who take vows of poverty—admirable for their adherence to their moral principles, but irrelevant for serious policy debates.Libertarians can’t band together to try to impose their will on others. As a libertarian activist, you mostly ally with people who are being oppressed by the government. They may not share your views on freedom and non-violence in general, but they do in their particular case. So back in the 1970s, when I started doing this, the big libertarian issues were elimination of government discrimination against homosexuals, police violence in poor and minority communities, overincarceration especially of poor and minority individuals, equal protection for battered women and rape victims (at the time it was legal in every state for a man to rape his wife, in fact it wasn’t legal rape, and in most states to beat his wife, although there were limits on the amount of physical injury he could inflict and the amount of noise if there were neighbors), rigged voting, legalization of marijuana, ending foreign military adventures, stopping torture and assassination and detention without charges or trial, excessive bail and horrendous jail conditions, abortion rights, secret police tactics against dissidents, secrecy and government surveillance.In all of those issues we had some support from some progressives. In most cases there were specific progressive groups—feminists, for example—who were strongly in the camp, but the majority of progressives regarded these things as minor side issues to the class struggle, or winning elections, or defeating political enemies, or something else. In fact, things like homosexual marriage and legalization of marijuana or refusing to give your social security number to anyone but social security were usually treated like tin-hat issues—things that would never, ever happen and would be bad if they did—libertarians weren’t wrong for supporting them, they were nut cases.Of course, not only did most these things come to pass, but they were absorbed into the progressive world view, so if you oppose them you are a reactionary. For example, Democrats in Congress at the behest of a Democratic President voted 150–79 for the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996, outlawing gay marriage, but 17 years later, most of them not only thought gay marriage was a good idea, but actually discovered that it was mandated by the Constitution in words they had previously overlooked.So rather than asking for progressives and statists to understand anything in particular, I wish everyone celebrating relief from government oppression would cut back a little bit on their enthusiasm for getting the government to tell other people what to do, and using violence against innocents to accomplish things they think are good for society.",347,13,5k,"5,792",0,0

Equal treatment for all, regardless of race, religion, gender, etc. A healthy economy that allows people to earn money commensurate to their work effort and contributions to society. Etc., etc. We have very different views of how to get there, but the end points are the same.Government violence is real. Too many progressives don’t realize/appreciate that government is an instrument of force like no other. If you aren’t falling in line with what the law says, you risk your livelihood, incarceration, and even death. These are not small things. Those who legislate don’t believe these actions could ever be used against them (ahem, Harry “taxation is voluntary” Reid), but that doesn’t justify using those forces against your fellow citizens. Just because rules are being enacted by an elected legislative body instead of a despot doesn’t mean the threats against the citizenry are less real.Progressivism is inherently doomed to failure. History has shown time and again that oppressive governments lead to economic catastrophes and/or violent uprisings by the oppressed. It isn’t just a matter of trying again and hoping to get it right this time. It is a fallacy to believe that you can control what people want and are willing to do.

In fact, it’s highly likely that a large fraction of progressives are hoping for outcomes similar to those I’d like to see. I think that any group of people are roughly equally prone to corruption and I’m just really no more eager to give government the right to control the minutia of our lives than corporations. I don’t agree with the Libertarian Party and I’m not interesting in some of the rapid and drastic structural changes I see advised from time to time.The one thing I’d most hope to make progressives understand is that I just think many of the issues we struggle with as a nation are best dealt with on a more local level. Our local schools would be more adaptable if we didn’t have to get constant approval from people who aren’t fully informed as to local problems. Our police forces would be much less likely to shoot us if they were neighbors that were directly involved in the communities they were policing. We can divert kids from pursing violent paths through community support and engagement before they ever turn to gangs. We can reduce social stigmas, incentives for violence, and systemic cycles of oppression by ending prohibitions. I think smaller communities are better equipped to handle many problems through social systems than distant government bureaucracy.If we fix our local communities by working together to create the solutions to our own problems then we won’t need to use government as an oppressive force. Economic, political, and social systems are not things that the government creates. Every trade of resources or labor is economics but you don’t need the government involved when you lend your neighbor a cup of sugar, any activity involved in governing is politics but that isn’t limited to politicians in the capitol buildings. We should only really need to handle problems at scale, so waiting for time to vote to send the elected to meet with strangers at a distant location so they can maybe eventually try to address your problem by lumping it in the rest of the region may not be the best way to fix local problems.There’s another element to this that I won’t go into as deeply. It has become painfully apparent that the higher you go in government the less aware our politicians are of technological possibilities. It would seem that all these 70 year olds aren’t keeping up with the cutting edge of technology and science, weird right? The world is constantly changing and we can’t institute one large scale policy that’s going to fix everything and allow us to adapt to changing possibilities. We need to be able to respond quickly to a rapidly changing landscape and the more we have to run through our largest government bureaucracies the less we’ll be able to do that.",153,5,93,64,0,0

They follow the theology of Cain, who came up with an alternate paradigm because Cain did not like God’s paradigm.Republicans act and believe that we are our brother’s brother. But the question is about the Democrats.In the 1850s Democrats kept their brothers on plantations. Post Nixon, the Democrats realized they could not afford to be soft on crime. So the Democrats pushed all kinds of laws to prove that they were not soft on crime. The result is that they keep their brothers in prisons… well, some of their brothers. They keep most of their brothers, and sisters, on identity group plantations.On the plantation, people can get away with all kinds of things, terrible rap lyrics, terrible behavior of many forms. But just let Clarence Thomas, or Diamond and Silk, or Kanye West try to leave the plantation and watch the lynching that ensues. They can overlook Bill Clinton raping women. But they cannot overlook someone leaving the plantation.The Democrats stand for a hierarchy on the plantation. Those with a PHD are above those with a Masters, who are above those with a BA/BS who are above those with an AA, who are above those with Highschool. But Democrats also believe in keeping/taking care of their brother.So their brother who is a victim, oppressed and has not finished high school, or who does not hold a job and is on welfare holds a more honorable position of victim-hood and is more entitled to be taken care of (at least with lip service) than the brother who is just a hardworking high school grad.So the Democrats stand for taking care of people.

2,Where is the evidentiary support for the Democratic Party's claim of the coming blue wave?,Progressive Blue Wave,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"From the last year of special elections.The sum total of the last year and change of specials has been roughly a 12% advantage to the Democrats.A 12% advantage would be more than sufficient to overcome the 5–6% advantage the GOP currently holds in the House thanks to the present state of gerrymandering. A 12% advantage in the Senate would likely flip Jeff Flake’s seat and maybe Bob Corker’s seat, along with ousting Dean Heller, Ted Cruz and maybe even Cindy Hyde-Smith, with Heidi Heitkamp as the only really vulnerable Democrat in that scenario, thus giving the Democrats not only the House, but a slim (53–47) lead in the Senate.I am not confident that the numbers will stay there for the next six months, but even if that 12% advantage gets cut in half, it will likely still give the Democrats the House, albeit narrowly. If it stays close to where it is, there are over 100 districts with a PVI of 11 or less currently represented by Republicans. Take a look at the map:(via wikipedia)You’ll see lots of bright blue dots surrounded by red districts. In places like North Carolina, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, this is thanks to the gerrymandering tactic of “packing and cracking” - “Pack” the most voters of the other party into one district, and “crack” the rest across several others so they are a minority. This gives you setups like Pennsylvania, where the majority of Democratic voters are packed into 4 districts with a PVI of D+15 to D+40, while the remaining Republican leaning-districts are never more unbalanced than a PVI of R+19, and mostly sit around R+2 to R+11.Normally, an R+11 district like PA-18 would be a lock for the Republican Party. Democrat Conor Lamb won that seat last year.If the Democrats can manage to keep a 10% or more advantage, you will see a lot of flips like that, because that’s how the GOP designed the maps in those swing states in 2010.Original question:Where is the evidentiary support for the Democratic Party's claim of the coming blue wave?",904,14,556,"3,877",1,1

2,Why do people think that the Dems and GOP have flipped in a half century?,Democratic Party (US politics),Republican Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"I wouldn’t say they’ve flipped at all. In my mind, the democrats changed enormously over the course of their existence, but not in the last fifty years.Don’t forget that the Democratic party was pretty much the party of the South during the civil war. That’s an oversimplification, and in reality the party split at the Charleston convention of 1860, but the modern democratic party, at least as of Woodrow Wilson and epitomised by FDR, I think has remained pretty stable in its approach, within the context of the changing times.What has dramatically changed is the Republican party. The first Republican President, Lincoln, undoubtedly would not recognize it today. I think this change came from two things: First, the Southern Strategy adopted in the 60’s, to try to win back the South, and second, Ronald Reagan.From a fiscal perspective, since the 1980’s the Republicans have preached a mantra of small government while increasing spending with every president. The difference is that they tend to increase military spending while cutting spending on social programs, coupled with reductions in taxes, focusing on the wealthy and corporations, due to a belief in what non-economists think of as “trickle-down” theory. There is the old (and apparently partially true) story of Arthur Laffer explaining his curve to Reagan on the back of a napkin and contributing to his decision to lower taxes in the expectation of increased revenues.This didn’t work then, and it continues not to work. Check out budget deficits under democratic and Republican presidents since Reagan. You’ll find that Republicans very clearly and rather dramatically increase deficit spending, which would have sent Eisenhower Republicans into a frenzy. They were bouncing off the Keynesian ideas of FDR, railing against deficit spending and preaching fiscal responsibility.Socially, those same Eisenhower Republicans were against government interference in private lives. They were anything but allied with social politics, but the main core of the Southern Strategy was alliance with evangelicals, and you get what you pay for.So, as I see it, it’s the Republicans who have largely flipped.

Evidence just this week, when Kanye West came out in agreement with Black commentator Candace Owens in support of President Trump, the backlash and vile hate mail from Leftist Democrats was horrific! Chance the Rapper also chimed in supporting Kanye’s tweets, but was immediately so overwhelmed by hate speech from Democrats that he publicly apologized and ran for cover!Democrats are brazen liars on this issue. ThenRepublican Party was founded by Abolitionists trying to end slavery of Blacks. It has never changed from that position, that all people have rights and no one should enslave or oppress another. Democrats, withndeeplynracist brliefs, dominated the South all through the period of Slavery and Reconstruction. The shift toward Republican strength in the South began under Eisenhower in 1952, and accelerated as people in the South became increasingly disgusted with the violence of Democrat violent oppression of Blacks, including lynchings, beatings, dragging behind trucks, and torturing at KKK gatherings. LBJ, a Democrat President, was unable to get Democrat support for the 1964 Civil Rights Act, so he appealed to Republicans who passed it over Democrat resistance. He wagered that if a Democrat President could pass this, he is famously alleged to have said “I will have those nig… voting Democrat for the next 200 years. ” Despite the now often-repeated story that there was a massive reversal at this time of Democrats becoming Republicans and vice verse, only one politician famously changed sides: Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who had been a Democrat but was so disgusted by the violence of Democrats in KKK and Democrats physically beating and killing Blacks that he switched parties. You will be hard pressed to find others, or to find droves of Republicans changing Party to become Southern Democrats … because it simply didn't happen.Why Did the Democratic South Become Republican?Democrats are trying to take credit away from Republicans and give it to themselves for passing the 13th, 14th, and 15th Smendments, and the Civil Rights Act which were all actually passed by Republicans over strong Democrat opposition, especially in the South. They want the Black community today to believe that Democrats are the protectors of their civil rights, when in fact Democrats have been oppressing Blacks since the first Black slave arrived on our shores. It is just the methods that change. First there was chattel slavery, and Democrats seceded the South from the Union to protect their ability to continue that abominable practice. After they lost the Civil War, they locked Blacks into submission as sharecroppers, and prevented their education and denied them voting rights by the Jim Crow Laws and violent oppression by the KKK, populated almost entirely by Southern Democrats. Then they advanced to Segregation under the Plessy v. Ferguson decision by the Supreme Court, relegating Blacks to underfunded, rundown schools ensuring poor literacy and therefore poor prospects to advance their socioeconomic position. They fought bitterly against Integration after the Brown v Board of Education ruling struck down Segregation, but used red-lining to restrict Blacks to certain neighborhoods, and used the welfare system to destroy the Black family structure and make Blacks deeply dependent on government handouts. Today in any major US city run long term by Democrat politicians, you will find Blacks in largely segregated communities which are typically characterized by poor education, low literacy, crumbling infrastructure, high crime, high drug use and drug trafficking… and monolithic voting patterns for Democrats who continue to promise they will help the Black community, but never do.The Democrat Party never flipped with Republicans, They never stopped oppressing Blacks. They just changed tactics as laws overruled their various methods of keeping Blacks oppressed, uneducated, and dependent.Today, some Blacks like Kanye West have achieved wealth and fame, and freedom from Democrat oppression, He has millions of followers who hear his message that Blacks should vote Republican not Democrat. The vehemence and vile tsunami of hate speech that Democrats unleashed on him, Chance the Rapper, and Candace Owens this week is a clear signal how much this message terrifies them.

Clinton embraced a neoliberalism message of Lassez-Faire economiecs and signed in NAFTA and cut elements of the New Deal.Clinton used neoliberalism and changed it slightly to country neoconservative positions particularly on militarism and multiculturalist positions[1].That is in essence where the establishment parties are today.Neoliberal and Neoconservative, and it boiled down to one moment in history that changed where each Party had support.Footnotes[1] http://www.oupcanada.com/catalog...",46,3,140,"2,334",0,1

States vote for the president, not individuals.

To remove the electoral college would be to remove that representation.The problem with this question is that it assumes that “rulership” of one group over another is simply an unavoidable fact of reality, and maybe that's true, but I don't think so, and we shouldn't operate under the assumption that it is.The United States of America's system of government was designed to avoid the coalescence of power in one place, through decentralization. There were three branches of government, one of which being the executive branch, where the office of the president resides.Since then, the power of the executive branch has grown drastically, beyond what the founders intended, and the powers of government have grown outside of the local realm they started in.Instead of changing or dismantling the electoral college as others have proposed, what we should be doing is moving as much power as possible away from the executive branch, and down to the state and more local governments. The lower level of government it is, the closer it is to the people it is governing, and thus the more closely its laws align with the will of the governed.

The way things are set up, it’s advantageous for dissident factions of a party to splinter away and form new ones, with new leaders — better to be a rat’s head than a lion’s behind — and get that sweet, sweet airtime come election year.And there’s more. These are parties with very different origins and orientations:The Workers’ Party was formed from the syndicalist movements from the end of the right-wing military dictatorship, and grew to be the main leftist party of Brazil. After several election cycles, it was much more social-democratic than it was democratic socialist, and with a series of alliances with centrists in the then-PMDB as well as types like ACM and the defunct Liberal Party, Lula was able to win on a landslide in 2002 — and govern afterwards.Democratic Labour arose as a social-democratic party, not to be confused with Labour (PTB), a party founded by Vargas and modelled after the British party. Unlike most current leftist parties, it has a much more “old left” ring to it.The Socialist Party is another beast entirely, not merely because, along with PSB (Brazilian Socialists) it doesn’t care much at all about socialism; my town’s political dynasty belongs to the PSD, and they aren’t remotely resemblant of socialists.

Daniel Lobo has mentioned how the PCO and the PSTU (Workers’ Cause Party and Unified Socialist Labour Party, two splinter factions of the Workers’ Party) used to call each other “Imperialist tools of the far right”.If I had to choose to place my bets on the formation of either a Brazilian pan-leftist coalition or a Fascist internationale, I would go with the latter.",392,10,1.3k,666,0,0

Now, I'm not saying Bernie Sanders could have beaten Donald Trump in the general election - there is a lot of evidence to indicate that certain demographics that did not go for him in the primary would not have swung for him in the general either. However, with the unique circumstance of having Trump as an opponent, there is the distinct possibility people would have chosen to go with the opposite end of the rhetoric platform.Not that this has translated into anything for the DNC's self-awareness. Across the country as people sign up in droves to run for office on a Democratic ticket, the DNC consistently continues to pick moderate candidates with big money backing as their horse in every race. Just today Steny Hoyer was heard on tape discussing the DNC's decision to back a moderate in Colorado before the primary was even over rather than endorse a more liberal challenger. This was based on the conclusion of the Colorado delegation, not any of the state's voters.Donald Trump usurped the Republican party by riding a wave of unprecedented nationalism in a party that has been engineered over the course of four decades to fall behind authoritarian figures. The DNC has been able to avoid this pitfall, but their solution has been ignoring voters altogether and telling them who it is they'll be voting for instead of the other way around. Basically, their solution is to try and get more blue butts in seats rather than care about what their progressive credentials actually may or may not be. I'm not in favor of party purity, but certainly one must be able to state that a Democrat on the national level must at the very least be a reliable vote for upholding women's rights and health care.",141,4,123,115,0,0

If you mean will the party support progressive policies, which by and large are policies that support the working class, I believe they will support those policies. Those policies include:Raising the minimum wageMedicare for AllSupport for UnionsMiddle class tax cuts and asking the wealthy to pay their fair share of the wealth they accumulate in taxesWorker benefits, overtime, paid sick days etcPenalizing US corporations offshoring US manufacturing and service jobsTuition free public college for qualified studentsContinued support for minority groupsMoving to green energy and away from fossil fuelsBanking regulation to avoid another taxpayer bailoutMJ legalization and and an end to both the war on citizens that use drugs and also against mass incarceration policiesEnding big money in elections including overturning Citizens United that allows corporations to buy elections.My opinion is that the Democratic party should appeal to the working class. But racist Trump voters aren’t going to vote Democrat no matter what. The way to win is to bring out the young people and the progressives. Moderate Democrats aren’t going to vote for Trump either. The country is deeply divided and imo the key to winning is for Dems to bring out their own base. Progressive policies will bring out the maximum number of Dem leaning voters and that is the key to winning.And btw, Sanders hasn’t taken over the Dem party.

So I’d write off the coming election (2018) as a gimme for Democrats.In 2020 though, the Democrats will be in an interesting position. Trump isn’t incredibly popular generally. He should be an easy incumbent to beat. You just have to take his advantages and turn them against him. The Democrats don’t need to go left, although I’m sure they will.

It would seem obvious, especially to those on the conservative side, that a more liberal Democratic Party would lose votes.Likewise, it seemed self-evident to many Democrats, after Obama’s back-to-back victories, that Republicans needed to become less conservative, lest they should be relegated to permanent minority status.But Republicans became more conservative and still won. Now, I don’t think they won because they became more conservative. Doubtless, there are millions of Republicans who wish their party were the party of George H. W. Bush rather than that of Donald Trump. But we only have two viable parties.What this means is that a party doesn’t actually have to be all that popular to win. All it needs to do is to be less unpopular with its own voters than the other party is with its voters.Think about it as the interplay between 3 types of voters:Those who will vote for your side no matter what.Those who will be turned off and stay home under certain circumstances: scandals, poor economy, candidate they hate, etc.Those who will only come out and vote if there’s an issue or candidate that will excite them.Only a tiny fraction of voters is persuadable. And they’re not all persuadable by the same thing. You win more by getting the people who already agree with you to show up and vote than by convincing people to change their mind.It’s almost inevitable that the Democratic Party will move further to the left. That is where activism is pushing the party. The next nominee will be talking about things like Medicare for all and a jobs guarantee. The party is inexorably moving towards and even past Bernie Sanders. This will continue even if we lose in 2020.

These are values and policies that many Republicans and most Republican representatives agree on.Now let’s look at the Democratic Party has for a platform:Social equalityWelfare importanceAffordable healthcareMarket regulationThat’s pretty much it. From what i can tell, Democrats generally have wider ranging views among themselves than Republicans do, which makes it more difficult to find policies everyone agrees on and establish a base for the party.The last time the Democrats/liberals had a base, they held continuous power for almost 30 years. (1933–1969) (I’m not counting Ike because in today’s political scene he’d be considered a Democrat anyways. Nixon also might be able to be lumped into the modern Democrats, but that’s more of a stretch)The New Deal Coalition and the Civil Rights Movement were two of the only times in modern U.S history that the Democrats were able to have a base. When you voted Democrat, you knew exactly what kind of policies you were voting for.This is what needs to change. Democrats cannot and should not be unified by a hatred or distaste for the Republican Party or Donald Trump. That’s a weak cop-out. You don’t win elections by saying “Vote for us, because at least we’re not them.” You win elections by saying: “Vote for us, we support x, y, and z policies that will benefit the country most.If the Democratic Party wants to win elections in the long term, it needs to have a platform that is pro-Democrat, rather than anti-Republican.Does that mean that the Democrats will move farther to the left? Probably.But maybe they’ll still capture that moderate, discouraged Republican vote out of sheer respect for actually standing up in what they believe in rather than purposefully vague in order to pander to the anti-Republican sentiment in the masses and get cheap votes.If the Democrats want to win in 2020, they need to be just as unabashed and confident in their policies as the Republicans are in theirs.",286,3,253,517,0,0

There’s no way for the Democratic Party to continue dangling progressive policies in front of the base, then throwing it out the window in failed attempts to court conservatives.As for the outcome, I think they will end up running a moderate candidate, and the result will be a toss-up.

They really do not represent a center of the electorate. Instead they are the folks most able to get big political donations.

2,When will the Democratic Party pick a new presidental candidate or is it still Hillary Clinton?,Democratic Party (US politics),Hillary Clinton,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Each new election cycle requires that candidates present themselves for nomination and then be voted for through a series of state primaries, culminating in a nominee being chosen to stand for the general nation-wide Presidential Election.Hillary Clinton is most certainly not the present nominee for 2020 (since none have yet been selected), and is highly unlikely to put forward her candidacy, particularly in light of the fact that she’d be standing against an incumbent President to whom she lost the first time around. It’d also be her second attempt at the Presidency - she lost the nomination to Barack Obama, then won on her second attempt, but lost the election in 2016.As far as most are concerned, from what I’ve been reading, Clinton is largely considered too ‘damaged’ as a candidate: the GOP have spent more than a decade attacking and slandering her, to the extent that she has no credibility whatsoever among the Republican Party voters, and considerably damaged credibility among Independent voters - put bluntly, it’s unlikely she’d be able to secure sufficiently broad-based support to win the election in 2020.The Democratic Party needs to move past the ‘Old Guard’ approach, and need to focus on new blood, the sort of younger energising candidates that would encourage a broader number of voters to cast their ballots. Admittedly, I’m personally a fan of Joe Biden (who definitely isn’t a young party member!), but there are plenty of up-and-coming Democrats who could stand: Cory Booker, Tulsi Gabbard, Kamala Harris etc.Hillary’s pretty much finished in US politics, to be quite frank. Even if she somehow managed to secure nomination as a Democrat, and even if she won election to the Presidency, I expect she’d find herself being blocked by the GOP at every turn - it wouldn’t be productive for America.

Look for candidates to become apparent gradually between now and winter 2019. The casual observer will notice that some Senators, Governors, Congress members etc will speak out on various issues, publish biographies and travel to early primary states like Iowa and New Hampshire to introduce themselves to local activists. Political operatives will begin to get hired to run campaigns and you’ll see signs that become more and more obvious that people are gearing up to run.Candidates need money, endorsements, organizers and exposure and it’s hard to line all that up without people noticing. Pollsters hired by the campaigns will start testing name recognition and reputation in order to demonstrate viability to potential donors. Often this leaks when pollsters accidentally call reporters or their sources.I’m guessing there will be a field of 6–7 candidates and some of those will not make it to the first primary, others will drop out after their money dries up after early losses.

Even a mere majority of the Senate is hard for the Democrats to achieve because only 1/4 of the seats up for reelection are held by Republicans.Just about any legislation from Congress would be vetoed.Trump’s appointments would be blocked (those requiring the Senate to advise and consent — this does not include, e.g., John Bolton’s job).To the degree that Trump has governed at all, it has mostly been via executive orders and fiats; that would become even more true.The House and Senate oversight committees would no longer be shams, so there would be lots of public knowledge about Trump’s many crimes, and a very strong chance of criminal indictment once he’s out of office in 2020 (which he surely would be).There would be lots of indictments and convictions of Trump’s appointees and associates.Trump would become even more volatile and dangerous than he is now.People underestimate just how much damage was done by swallowing the anti-Clinton propaganda and allowing Trump to win. In addition to Gorsuch on the Supreme Court, Trump has appointed a very large number of extremely right wing judges to the federal bench — all those seats that the GOP refused to allow Obama to fill.

Of course, other factors would come into the equation, such as who is selected as his running mate, and who is offered as a candidate by the Democrats, but I like the guy. He has served under Presidents from Reagan on, and has a formidable resume. He served on Reagan's white House staff, and was a Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce, he has served in the Diplomatic Corps as an Ambassador to Singapore, China, and now, Russia, doing these things in both Republican and Democratic administrations. I believe he has demonstrated a willingness and ability to actually make things work in a bipartisan manner. His foreign policy experience is extensive, and he takes seriously the need to actually engage in diplomacy. Mr. Huntsman has also gained a good deal of Executive experience as Governor of Utah, a position which he left with an 80% approval rating. There are a lot of issues with which I wouldn't agree with him, as he IS a Conservative and I'm not, but of the people that I could foresee actually being able to get nominated by the Republican Party, Jon Huntsman, Jr. is one of very few I would even consider crossing party lines to vote for.",86,5,29,19,0,0

They listed the Federalist and the Daily Caller (which also posted this Hillary story) as right wing biased, but just short of extreme.Although I’m seen as Liberal/Progressive, I have gradually learned that some of my positions, like on Abortion, are conservative. So I didn’t disagree with all of the Federalist articles I saw. I took one of those on line political ideology tests that a Quoran posted yesterday and found I was conservative on some things, which surprised me.Anyway, I don’t know if the Democrats really did launder that money, but I did discover the DNC was corrupt and underhanded to Bernie at the last election, so I can’t automatically discount the story, nor confirm it.Oh, I fact checked the fact checker!

Communism, on the other hand, is a system in which property is collectively owned and tends toward single-party authoritarianism. Since Democrats are generally capitalists and believe in personal freedom and voting equality, that’s fairly incompatible with real-world Communism.In theory there can be pockets of communist-style communities within a capitalist system, but that’s getting pretty far removed from the question of Party affiliation. The ideology of the U.S. Communist Party is fairly socialistic, and does overlap with Democrats in some respects, such as wanting higher minimum wages, universal healthcare, more environmental protection and equal rights for women, minorities and LGBT.

In this they were acknowledging the wisdom of Sun Tzu who in 500 BCE wrote that “To win one hundred victories in one hundred battles is not the acme of skill. To subdue the enemy without fighting is the acme of skill.” “Cozy Bear” and “Fancy Bear” are the named coined by American cyber security company for two Russian groups of state-sponsored hackers to disrupt US elections. Of course, the US was neither the first nor the only western country to be targeted, and Vladimir Putin had an intense hatred for Hillary Clinton and feared her knowledge and competence. Due to series of blunders, which DNC Chair Donna Brazile describes in her book Hacks the Russian infiltration of the DNC computers went undiscovered for nearly a year.2) The failure of corporate media. CBS CEO Leslie Moonves’s statement sums up the attitude of all the major networks: ""It may not be good for America, but it's damn good for CBS... Man, who would have expected the ride we're all having right now? ... The money's rolling in and this is fun... I've never seen anything like this, and this going to be a very good year for us. Sorry. It's a terrible thing to say. But, bring it on, Donald. Keep going."" The media was obsessed with sensationalism because it increased their rating and profits. Trump, well-known has a swindler with a string of bankruptcies and failed businesses, received extensive coverage because of the circus he created. When covering Clinton, the media focused on putative scandals - again for sensationalism.3) The Right-Wing Entertainment Industry. Former Bush speechwriter, David Frum, coined this title to encompass Fox News (the propaganda unit of the Republican Party), and right-wing bloviators like Rush Limbaugh, Ann Coulter et.al. who practice incitement for fun and profit. For any form of representative democracy to function, the electorate must have correctly information - and not disinformation.4) The Republicans’ Thirty Years War of Calumny. The Republicans have conducted a relentless attack on both Clintons. They spend millions of taxpayer dollars for congressional investigations and even altered documents in an attempt to implicate Secretary Clinton. It is an unfortunate fact of human psychology that a lie repeated often enough becomes a “truth.”5) Campaign strategic failures. The Clinton campaign’s strategist Robbie Mook excessively on data analytics During the campaign, Donna Brazile commented on Mook's micro-tagging of voters based on purchasing preferences and how it ""missed the big picture"". In the aftermath of the campaign, former staffers and political pundits criticized Mook for his management style that impaired other staffers' access to critical information.6) Blindness to “the optics.” Clinton herself, while unequivocally the most intelligent, best educated, extensively experienced candidate, suffered from her inability to appreciate how some of her actions would appear to others and how these could be weaponized and used against her. Her comment about “the basket of deplorables” is an example. Certainly, there were racists who supported Trump, but there were a far larger number of innocent voters who were being deliberately misinformed. The e-mail server is another example. James Comey wrote that Clinton thought that the Secret Service protection around her home in Chappaqua would also protect her server from attack. Knowing that the Republicans were relentless in their attacks, HRC had two choices. She could retire from politics completely, or she could scrupulous in avoiding the slightest action that could be used to attack her. She did neither.Today’s Republican Party may have become the victim of its own “Southern Strategy.” That was a conscious effort to attract Southern Democrats infuriating by Lyndon Johnson’s signing of the Civil Rights Act in 1964. The Republicans made a Faustian bargain with this. The corruption inherent in the US system of lobbying, the SCOTUS’s egregiously mistaken decision in Citizens United, in concert with right-wing evangelicals and white supremacists will taken years if not generations to correct.Pulitzer-Prizing winning journalist David Cay Johnston argue that this year’s midterm election will be the most important election since the Civil War. It is worth remembering that in all of human history not one single great power has ever lasted. Some have continued on albeit in a greatly diminished condition and many have vanished.

It’s conservatives who hate Americans. That’s why they ask Americans to move away. Obviously that doesn’t apply to all conservatives, but for a certain group, there are certain things that they have in common.They hate our Constitution. They hate free speech. That’s why they are always proposing Constitutional amendments to take away freedoms. For example, conservatives proposed an amendment to ban flag burning. I didn’t even know it was a big problem, given I see an average of zero cases of flag burnings per year in the media, unless I count ones not on US soil.Another example would be a proposed amendment to ban gay marriage. It’s not just an attack on certain US citizens, it’s an attack on the fundamental nature of the Constitution. Conservatives don’t seem to get that the purpose of the Constitution is to define how the government works and to afford rights to citizens. It was never meant to be a law book that takes away rights from citizens. The one time it was changed to do that, it led to the only time a new amendment repealed an existing one.When liberals protest things such as wars, there are conservatives who say things such as “those soldiers fought for your right to free speech” and completely miss the irony that they are advocating against free speech at the same time.There are conservative states such as Texas where a significant number of people advocate seceding from the union.

We have poverty, fear, inequality, violence and are currently caught up in a system that benefits the richest ‘Haves’ among us at the clear expense of the ‘Have Nots’.We understand that the majority of the wars that we fight (especially the ones we start) are fought to further the profits of those that hold the financial strings that move us all this way and that. It is clear to us that ‘Supporting our Troops’ is NOT the same thing as sending them to wars to enhance the profits of a few.We understand that the religious fervor that many of us profess is not more holy or righteous, or even really different, than the religious fervor professed by many of the people that we call terrorists.It is obvious to us that using up and/or destroying our natural resources and climate in the name of short term financial ease and laziness, instead of maintaining them responsibly and sustainably, is not in the best interests of anyone, except the few people who have the means (or so they think) to avoid the negative results of our actions. Further, we feel that being better environmental stewards of our earth is just plain and simply the right thing to do.We believe that all people are created with equal rights and that even if they believe differently than we do, that they should be loved and accepted as who they are, whether they have different opinions, behave in a different way than our traditional (outdated???) norms, look different, dress different, whatever, they are still citizens and should have our respect and support.We realize that America’s greatness has always been a direct result of accepting diverse people representing diverse cultures into our nation and giving them the chance to become innovative thinkers that further propel us to that greatness. We get completely that they are to be embraced (even when it’s uncomfortable) as full members of our energetic and diverse society. When we fail at that, our society stagnates and our greatness ebbs.We understand that laws are made by men, and often by men with demonstrated self interest, and, as such, are flawed.The reality is that we DO NOT want to move away (even though some, in despair, have suggested doing that in these dark times) but instead vow to fight on for our beloved country.

It has been well documented that he worked aggressively to get on the Forbes 400. The efforts to have his real estate holdings inflated in value and to get credited with most of the value of the Trump Organization attributed to him speaks volumes about his lack of real wealth. Couple that with his refusal to release tax returns and it spells, no equity and severely leveraged. Trump pursues anything with management fees or the ability to pocket membership fees is a sign of less than substantial wealth.Second, there is no such thing as the middle class. It's a made up concept. We have income levels and we have class distinctions. The middle class goes from enough income to be described as better off than the working poor to an argument whether someone making $400,000 a year deserves a middle class tax cut. You are labor, management, owners, or part of the professional classes. If you make $85,000 as an HVAC guy, you are a skilled laborer. If you are a struggling insurance sales guy just starting out making $33,000, you are a professional. Or you make $143,000 as a manager. As far as I can see, we have three people with three different economic circumstance, calling them middle class is insulting.Three, Trump won the leaners, late deciders, and independents rather easily after the Comey letter was released.Four, Trump's victory amounts to moving fewer than 100,000 votes in three states for 46 Electoral College votes.

Trump didn't do anything like that. He talked economics, he talked rights, he promised to lower taxes and bring back jobs. Higher level issues were spoken of, of course, like foreign policy or immigration, but he never neglected to tell you how his election would help you personally. Even Bernie Sanders supporters went Trump after Clinton won the primaries. Clinton spoke to the vocal minority; Trump spoke to the people.

[1] He did not.For example, a March 2016 NBC survey that we analyzed showed that only a third of Trump supporters had household incomes at or below the national median of about $50,000. Another third made $50,000 to $100,000, and another third made $100,000 or more and that was true even when we limited the analysis to only non-Hispanic whites. If being working class means being in the bottom half of the income distribution, the vast majority of Trump supporters during the primaries were not working class.These graphs reflect reality— and the Trump voters I know.

It isn’t usually people in human service professions or clinical positions related to healthcare, etc.The fear mongering & real American, the US is a Christian country is strong in suburbs. The stereotype that it is working class rural Americans driving this sentiment. I live in Metro Detroit. There has been a long time Muslim community in this area, but immigration has increased. The post 9/11 anti-Arab / anti-Muslim sentiment rose exponentially. Republican candidates nakedly jump on that fear to energize their base. This is actually the root of a lot of the support of Israel—it isn’t necessarily a love of the Israeli people.Status & economic insecurity— mostly among white people.The “ I hate PC, minorities are treated better, multiculturalism is bad, feminists are marxists” crowdPure shadenfraude: this is a bigger driver than many would think. The hatred towards liberals, people on the left, etc Hatred of Hillary Clinton & Democrats. I am sure there are things that Dems, liberals, etc do to earn animus. But there is also a cult on the radio & internet that creates stereotypes of liberals that just gets people fomenting. It is unnerving & bizarre. It is also sad because I see people scapegoating Dems & liberal for almost everything.His promises to bring back manufacturing jobs. The UAWs collective bargaining with Ford was at the heart of bringing some manufacturing to the Detroit area. The city of Detroit proper did not come out for Trump, but some of the lower middle class suburbs were openly supportive. Even though the unions are why some of their manufacturing jobs pay them well enough to be part of the middle class, they voted for a man whose party is devoted to union busting.The Democratic platform & candidate failed to appeal.

We elect representatives who are then empowered to act on our behalf as they see fit.Demonstrations, riots, commentators, and so forth can influence how people think , but ultimately, extremists are beaten at the voting booths because their ideas suck.Although the numbers will vary from state to state, on the average, about 35% of the voters are Republicans and about 35% are Democrats. (Most of those on the far right and the far left are included in these percentages.)The fact is that the people who actually decide elections are the 30% in the middle. These are the people who need to be persuaded to vote against conservatism — not those on the right (or the far right).What wins elections are competent and well-qualified candidates equipped with persuasive arguments that are focused on the issues that people (in the middle) are concerned about.You will seldom, if ever, succeed in changing someone’s mind if they are an extremist (either far right or far left). In fact, it’s a waste of time energy and effort to even try.If you want to make a difference, talk with people who say that they are in the middle or politically undecided.Personally, I do not agree with everything in the usual Democratic platform, but I do agree with most of it.Here are some important points:Health Insurance: Per-capita medical costs in the USA are the highest in the world, but our medical care system is mediocre, at best. We need a national single-payer health insurance program. This could be done by simply expanding Medicare to cover people of all ages. Private health insurance companies could still offer supplemental or “advantage” plans (that are currently only available to medicare recipients) and employers could offer to pay for these private plans for employees as a benefit.Jobs: The US is losing ground on the world market for manufactured goods. This is hurting our balance of trade and costing us jobs. Tariffs are not the answer because they create higher prices for US consumers and they do not address the underlying issue: manufacturing labor costs are much, much, lower in many other countries and they can produce goods cheaper than the USA.It’s a safe bet that these jobs are not going to come back to the USA (unless our workers are willing to work for $1/hour), so we need to find another solution. the solution is that there are jobs the US workers can be competitive on the world market —but these jobs generally require higher education (beyond high school).The key is education. We need to focus on educating our children and re-training our adults to take up different jobs where the US can compete effectively on world markets.Interest-free, government-backed, loans should be available (to US citizens only) to cover 100% of cost for tuition and books at all community colleges, and public universities. (Interest-free loans for private colleges and universities should be limited to the costs charged by public institutions in the same state.)US born kids are facing very tough competition from foreign students for admissions to our colleges and universities. We should consider setting caps on the number of foreign student visas that are issued each year, and establish maximum percentage quotas on the number of foreign students allowed to attend.We should also discontinue H1B visas that allow US employers to hire foreign workers for US positions.Taxes: Democrats don’t like paying taxes any more than anybody else does, but unlike Republicans, we don’t think that those in the middle and lower class should be expected to carry 99% of the tax burden.",104,5,231,"1,415",0,0

3,How can we fight against the radical conservatives in the USA?,Social Justice,Democratic Party (US politics),Racism,1!,1!,1!,"A2A:First, I think that those who want to fight “radical conservatives” need to come to some sort of agreement as to what is actually meant by the term, rather than using it as a catch-all for ideas that they do not like. On Quora, which is in my opinion, a far more thoughtful treatment of serious questions than one encounters in the general discourse, there is a plethora of questions about “the alt right,” “the far right,” “radical Republicans,” and the like, without much actual discussion as to what that means. Mixed in is a fair amount of vacuous claims about how past Republicans (and Reagan tops the list) would not stand a chance in the current GOP because it has grown far too conservative, or how the US is so right wing compared to “the rest of the world,” by which people mean “the social democracies of northwestern Europe.”We need an agreed upon, fact-based definition of what the “radical right” is rather than cliches and slogans.Second, to “fight” them effectively, you need to acknowledge that not everything that they are talking about is just fever swamp racism. This is not to give credibility to guys like Richard Spencer (who frankly, I had never heard of until Hillary Clinton started screeching about the “alt right”). Real racism needs to be pointed out and combated.But simply saying that a nation - any nation - has a fundamental obligation to the people who live there first is not “racism.” Trying to argue that the US, almost uniquely in the history of the world, has not in the past 50 years voluntarily changed its demographics, which has had good and bad consequences is to deny reality. I live in California. In San Francisco. Perhaps the number one challenge here is that our city, which is about 100 square km in size, is projected to add 200,000 people over the next 25 years on top of the already 800,000 already here. WHERE are they going to live? And that means that the price of housing has climbed beyond insane. The median home here is about $1.5 million (that is a one and a five with five zeroes). The locals in California like to complain about how the ‘tech’ people are ‘ruining’ SF. And maybe they are. But the reality is that virtually all of the net population growth in California (and in SF) over the past 30 years is due to immigration.I am an immigrant myself. I am not anti-immigrant. But if you point out that, with unlimited immigration into a place where you cannot just build more land, the utterly predictable consequence is going to be crushing costs for housing.It is not existentially racist to point this out.Pretending that the problem is frat brothers moving here from Illinois is just not reality. Acknowledge the downsides. Propose solutions to address them.Third, listen to what they say. Point out where they are so obviously wrong. Offer real evidence that stands in contrast. Putting on a mask, throwing a trash can through a window, and then claiming that you are “resisting” ain’t going to do it. Neither is punching Richard Spencer in the face and posting it on YouTube. Both may feel very satisfying, and both may touch the political erogenous zones of people who already agree with you.But guess what? To people who are somewhere in the middle, you look like a hypocritical idiot.I know the counter-argument. The radical right are fact and evidence invariant. Some of them (maybe even most) are. That is true.But you are not trying to convince them. They are just too few of them to matter in any case. You need to work on those whose minds are not made up. These people are not fact invariant.

They rule people by seeking easily fooled people, creating fear, fanning the flames and encouraging it to spread, and offering a solution. Let’s work the other way: let’s create hope and offer a path to prosperity:Speak candidly about where we are and offer facts to prove it.Encourage desperate displaced people by offering education and training and giving their children path to a better lifeRecover confidence in our great media (the NY Times, WaPo, etc)Provide a path to clean energy and show how that’s the best thing for our nation and worldProvide healthcare as another part of our infrastructureConservatives are fond of branding themselves the keepers of the Constitution.

Democrats are anti Wars started by republicans because it’s convenient. But anti war? Obama ordered more drone strikes than Bush so that’ll take some convincing.I don’t understand your point about outsourcing work. Democrats essentially do the inverse of outsourcing which is “insourcing” I guess you could call it. They decide completely on their own that we need more labour so they relax the immigration system and push for amnesty for millions of immigrants. This probably actually has a much greater strain on American wallets than outsourcing. Outsourcing at least leads to significantly cheaper products and foreign workers don’t have a strain on American welfare. Immigration however does. It leads to increased strain on our health services, schools, police, housing, etc. When all of these are factored in, a lot of immigrant groups actually have a net loss for the economy.If they actually cared about “the little people” they’d craft policy geared towards helping the poor rather than accepting poverty as the natural state of these people. I mean look at their rhetoric with regards to the poor. They almost never account for a scenario in which these people aren’t poor…have you ever heard a democrat say “when they’ve moved into the middle class…”? I haven’t. Despite the fact that if you start in the bottom 20%, you’re actually more likely to move into the top 20% by the end of your life than still be in the bottom 20%.By the way, I think I speak on behalf of all Quora when I say your logic is seriously bad. I don’t know if you’re right wing, left wing, democrat, republican or independent but please never go into politics. I mean let’s just say we go to war with arguably the biggest stealer of American jobs in the world…China. Congratulations, nuclear Armageddon over a misunderstanding of economics. Feel good about yourself? And if not China…India. Great, we’re declaring war on allies now…and still nuclear Armageddon. Let’s pick on a non nuclear country that American corporations deal with that isn’t a significant threat like Bangladesh and pretend this war has no impact on other geopolitical issues. What’s our end game? We bomb a load of major employers in Bangladesh? So now Americans have more expensive clothing and millions of Bangladeshi citizens just despise America to its core.

Does Apple count…they make their phones in China after all? Lego…again, China? Clothing lines…Bangladesh, India, China and too many African countries to name? Let’s take an actual right wing corporation like Walmart. Walmart have a subsidiary called ASDA. Do you know in which horrible job stealing foreign country ASDA operates? The United Kingdom. We would now be bombing the U.K.? No, I don’t think it’s in the interest of “the little people” that we bomb the U.K. with the false expectation that said bombing will result in job growth. It won’t. This is a fallacy pushed by left and at times the right that we “lose” jobs to other countries. Often the number of jobs Apple create in a country like China they couldn’t keep up with in the US due to minimum wage laws, regulations and taxes. So let’s say Apple have 100,000 manufacturing jobs in China (I made that number up I don’t know the real stat) and we somehow ban them from operating in other countries. The US economy doesn’t gain 100,000 manufacturing jobs. That’s just not how it works. And now Americans end up paying $5,000 for an iPhone which actually gives non-American companies like Samsung a huge advantage.Trade wars and real wars don’t really have winners.

In what ways would the decision to do so affect the already deep cultural and political divide in this country?",Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"First of all, it is an open question as to whether a sitting President even can be indicted. There are good arguments on both sides—one of the prosecutors of Nixon in the Watergate crisis says he absolutely can be, but others assert as vigorously that he cannot. Secondly, it is counterproductive right now for the Democrats to bring up the issue of impeachment because they do not have the votes and it only serves to fire up Trump supporters. But if Mueller;s report shows that there was active collusion between Trump and Russia, and if he also proves that there were other crimes that Trump has committed, after the election which could well see the Democrats will win back a majority (in the average mid-term election the party in power loses around 25 seats), they most definitely should bring articles of impeachment. A fundamental principle in our Republic is that no person is above the law. “We are a nation of laws, not men.” Granted that it must be more difficult to indict a president than an average person—lest everyone with a grievance tries to bring charges against a President they don’t like—but there appears to be plenty of evidence that this administration is a virtual criminal enterprise. And, in classic demagogic fashion, Trump is trying to wreck the very institutions that were designed to see to it that justice would prevail. Political divide or not, for those who continue to defend Trump in the face of mounting evidence against both him and his minions, their opinions matter less than the overwhelming majority of citizens who will want to see justice done. It would be a long and painful process to bring him to justice, if that is what the process brings us to, but it is also a necessary process to defend the eternal principles that underlie our system of government.Important too to remember that before Trump won, many of his supporters said they’d be in the streets with weapons if Hillary won because he’d convinced them that she could only win by hook or crook.",89,4,18,341,0,0

I’ve noted this many times in some of the endless queries that are obsessed with “free markets.” In what world could any free market exist when the criteria for it don’t exist. Textbook free market theory fails the reality test of human nature, which is why all markets are regulated, managed and controlled to varying degrees…almost always via government policies and agencies. So free markets are a myth.Democracy is not a myth. It actually exists and functions about as well as can be expected given…human nature.

20,Are free market capitalism and democracy compatible?,Government and Economics,Capitalism,1!,1!,1!,1!,"The biggest problem we all have when trying to discuss so-called Free Market Capitalism, is that the majority of the people advocating it, haven’t got the slightest clue what they are actually talking about. And many people who chatter on about democracy, don’t know what they are talking about either.The first thing to look for with pro-”free market” people, is HOW MUCH REGULATION AND LIMITATION ON MARKET PARTICIPANTS, THEY ASSUME WILL STILL HAPPEN IN SPITE OF NO GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT.If you look carefully, without prejudice, you’ll see that every single person who thinks Free markets would result in wonderfulness, are assuming a TREMENDOUS amount of regulation and government support would still be firmly in place.They assume everything from the idea that all the various government testing agencies would still protect us all from poisonous and lethally defective goods, to the continued government protection of intellectual and physical property rights, to empowering customers to take legal and other action against abusive market participants.In an ACTUAL “Free Market,” the only way to learn that, for example, food you are buying is poisonous, is for one of your family members to die from it, AND you spend thousands to hire a private medical staff to prove that, only in the end, to have your ONLY resolution be, that you stop buying that food.That sort of thing is WHY human society, over the ages, consistently and repeatedly turned away from “Free Market” capitalism, and settled on various levels of regulation.Now. As for the part that Democracy plays:there’s a lot of very different government systems which get the general label of democracy slapped on them. What might be called “pure democracy,” where ALL group decisions are made by each citizen voting on one decision at a time, is incredibly rare, because it’s unwieldy and impractical to stop and arrange a vote every few minutes, and so only shows up at all, in very small local groups.Most “democracies” are therefore representative democracies of one kind or another. The variation in how much power the majority has in each one, is also tremendous.In any case, if you actually want to have “Free Markets,” you must have NO GOVERNMENT AT ALL. If ANY government exists, then the Markets will be affected by it in some way.So that means that Free Market capitalism not only is incompatible with ANY form of democracy, it’s incompatible with any form of government whatsoever.Bottom line, what people who talk about this should ACTUALLY be labeling it all is, “DIFFERENTLY regulated Capitalist Markets.” Not “Free Markets.”",118,0,247,"5,557",0,0
20,Are free market capitalism and democracy compatible?,Government and Economics,Capitalism,1!,1!,1!,1!,"What, again ? I have stated this many times.Capitalism is a myth. It does not exist, never did, and never will. Marx came to England, saw what was going on, and called “it” capitalism, which he then defined. BUT, he was a silly man, who got it wrong. The “system” he described is impossible, and reflects merely his inability to use his eyes and see what was going on around him. Not surprising; he was an immigrant German Jew, too clever by half, an arrogant know all with an axe or two to grind. He entered Great Britain at the time when it was undergoing the most extreme changes - political, social, economic, financial, industrial, scientific, educational, religious, legal, industrial, commercial, - to name a few - greater than it had experienced before or since, probably greater than any country has ever experienced, short of bloody revolution, when the “experiences” tend to be fatal - and where he tried, (BUT FAILED) to understand what was “up.”Since Marx we have had a journalistic profession of well meaning students of humaniora who have little understanding of science, philosophy, economics or history, and who are thus unable to see the mistakes Marx made through his unscientific posturing, poor philosophy, rotten economics and junk (or is not the new word “fake” ?) history. So we have capitalism here, and capitalist “systems” there, and “failures of capitalism” whenever there is an economic imperfection - (there will always be economic imperfections !) - and always a Marxist scholar on hand to explain that “Socialism” will take care of that - one day, some day, despite total failure on all previous attempts.Nothing real is compatible with “capitalism.” Free markets are another matter: also a purely theoretical construct, but even imperfect markets are much better than government dirigisme - and we can see imperfections in the market, and work to remove them _ it usually involves nothing more than getting the government wonks to take their boots off the throat of the market - but that is something government thugs are loath to do. But then, most govt. economic wonks are marxist idiots - as are most economists. And most politicians, too.So, the substance of your question is, “can semi-free markets work with democracy ?” - and the answer is of course, “Yes.” It is by this means that politicians, when they have well and truly screwed up, can gracefully step back from the mess they have created, (see the Democrats in the USA now) loudly complaining that the wuz robbed, and they were cheated, and so on and so forth, while thanking their lucky stars that they will not have to face the opprobium of admitting they were wrong when their policies get their come uppance: now they can just say, “See what an idiot Trump is !”Free markets good: “regulated” markets much less good, (the true term is “corrupted” markets.) “Democracy” very dubious, merely better than all the alternatives: just about “bearable” - for a country in good economic health.",592,3,132,"2,595",0,0

Other students at that school who were actually more involved than Hogg, who depending on which of his interviews you believe was cowering in a closet, or miles away at home at the time, were prevented from attending and speaking at the CNN town hall and excluded from the broadcasts off the other mainstream media because their views did not fit the anti-Second Amendment Anti-NRA narrative the Left wants to push on America.The true blame for the Parkland shooting lies in two places: with the incompetence of the FBI and Broward County Sheriff Department who were acutely aware of the threat that Nikolas Cruz presented but did nothing, and the Obama Administration program to pay tens of thousands of Federal taxpayer dollars to the Broward school Administration for artificially reducing their statistics on school crime by simply not arresting even violent criminal students like Cruz. If he had been arrested on any of a number of criminal counts, he would have failed his background check and never been allowed to purchase the gun he used to massacre his fellow students as he promised on social media.

2,What is the answer to Jordan Peterson's question?,Progressive Political Movement,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"Well firstly I must say I am also an outsider and much like Peterson I am simply confused by the mindsets of both sides. On the one hand I can see where anti-Trump people come from a lot of the time. He is not a good President. He does not act responsibly and he has been proven to lie or simply just not know what he is talking about frequently. That part I can identify with.However what I don’t understand is why many of these people also clearly show that they believe that he can do no right. For example when Trump tweeted about a pardon for Jack Johnson Vox, a clearly very left wing news outlet, published this- Donald Trump’s potential pardon of Jack Johnson, explained - In the article they basically eluded to this being a thinly veiled attempt at trying to deceive people of his racist beliefs. In my eyes when Trump’s critics do things like this I simply can’t see their reasoning. It is clearly a positive thing that he is going to pardon a prominent historical black figure for a criminal charge that was clearly unfair and racially motivated. Do they not see that this kind of condescension if you will is the reason he was elected in the first place? On top of that many wish to see him fail, however do they not realise that if he fails, then they fail too? If you want his presidency to be a disaster just so you can say I told you so then to me that is narcissistic and on top of that shows a clear misunderstanding or misinterpretation of politics and society. The aim is not to see your opponents drag everyone down so that you can prove that you were right.So to answer your question I think that those who oppose Trump need to stop doing so in a way that only makes him stronger. When Maher talks about how Trump’s base will not stop supporting him no matter what he does, I think he’s wrong to an extent. The reason that he has this cult like following is because those who support him are becoming more and more alienated by the day by people from the left and right calling them every name in the book. To them that only reinforces their beliefs. In order to properly defuse the Trump hysteria I think his opposition should tone down the rhetoric first. By demonstrating their superior case in a calm and factual manner, they are much more likely to have success. By calling a moderate Trump supporter a racist, bigot, homophobe you simply drive them closer towards him, as the reason they voted for him is because they were sick and tired of the ‘PC culture’ and the age of outrage which we live in. As a relatively impartial (his actions have minimal effect on me) onlooker I think that people need to understand the mindset of a Trump supporter in order to really combat him. It seems to me that Trump is a kind of extreme reaction to extreme leftist culture, in the sense that many left wing agendas had become so forcefully pushed under the Obama administration, there was inevitably going to be a right wing reaction of similar, if not greater, proportions. It has no doubt been divisive and unquestionably undesirable, but the fact is that this is the reality and in order to end it opponents need to foster a little more empathy. And yes this seems like a naive and simplistic answer, however in my opinion there is simply no other way to close the rift. People need to analyse the cause in order to understand the effect.",57,1,5,45,0,1

Nor is he afraid to expend assets to accomplish goals, and while sometimes his goals may seem strange or even irrational, in hindsight there is either a grand strategy or an amazing amount of “beginner’s luck” in his actions.Trump has adopted many of the favorite Democrat techniques, such as throwing up upsetting issues which his opposition must focus on in order to retain their credibility, while at the same time moving ahead with other goals which, while still objectionable to the Democrats, fly comparatively unopposed simply because the Democrats are distracted. Heretofore this technique has been the exclusive property of the Left, and it is almost amusing to see the Democrats wince at how bad their own medicine tastes.Thus, the Democrats waste their not-inconsiderable support-generation efforts in raising ire against what are essentially decoy issues that Trump raises, and waste their strength as the Republicans did facing the same technique - in running in circles.Trump has galvanized the Democrats to run in circles, and to use up all their strength in doing so.",38,0,94,450,0,0

3,What is a true democratic nation?,Democratic Nations,Democratic National Conventions,1!,1!,1!,1!,"If you define “true democratic nation” as a country that governs itself via direct democracy, where every citizen votes on every question, there is no such thing. Ancient Athens made a good go of it, but even they had very restrictive rules about who could participate. (Essentially, you had to own property. And you could only own property if you were male and had money enough to acquire property. That’s not exactly how we think of “citizen” today.)Direct democracies have to be small. There are towns in the US where it works well, for example. It matters that everyone participates. I have to know how my vote will effect you, you have to know how your vote will effect me, and so on. Imagine yourself being asked to vote on, e.g., whether or not a post office in a town three thousand miles away from you should be allowed to change its name. My vote would be for “Who Cares?”The way democracy is implemented on a national level is “representative democracy,” which isn’t democracy at all but we sort of pretend it is. Instead of voting on every issue, we vote to select a particular person to make our decisions on those issues for us. That vote is democratic, but from then on, it’s out of our hands (for the most part.)I say “for the most part” because there are a few times when we “revert” to direct democracy, at least on the state level. Recall elections is one example, where the voters unite to say “we goofed up last time, and we want a do-over.” Another example is the referendum, wherein a legislature decides to punt the vote on a particular issue to the citizens. The gay marriage thing was one of those in many states before the Supreme Court decided it was a matter for the Fourteenth Amendment to solve.(You’ll hear Switzerland being praised for its being a “true democracy” and working extremely well. Nope. Switzerland has elected leaders too. They do a lot more voting on issues than most countries do, but they are not a direct democracy any more than any other country. And note well that they are a small country and very culturally homogeneous.)",135,3,2k,"4,930",0,0

Whether that behavior was intentional, or because he was unable to control himself - or even because that is who he really is, even his fellow Republican contenders often found that behavior to be unacceptable. Yet come the day when it appeared he was the leading contender, the Republican Party largely chose to close ranks around him and provide the support he needed.In other words, they delivered the message that “the Republican Party needs to occupy the White House at all cost and regardless of all else”. In doing so they also delivered the message that it was never ‘America first’, it had to be ‘the Republican Party first’.It was a choice that prioritized power over political principles and moral values,Regardless of whether it was wise or not to invest in a candidate from the other side, I find it admirable that any individual steps forward and is prepared to say “I refuse to support this any longer and I’m prepared to put my money where my heart, mouth, morals and values lie”.I have also found it inspiring to read in the last week that Michael Bloomberg - who ran for Mayor of New York as a Republican, has publicly stated he would donate $4.5 million to help cover some of the United States' financial commitments to the Paris Climate Accord, after Trump chose to withdraw America’s support.I have to close by saying that I often become concerned about a future where nearly 80% of the world’s wealth is controlled by only 20% of the population.

1,"Why do the Social Democrat parties in Eastern Europe (Romania, Slovakia, etc.) often behave in an illiberal manner?",Eastern Europe,Romania,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,"I guesz part of the reason is that if you trace the ancestry of social democrat parties in eastern Europe today, it is very likely that they are directly descended from some Communist party.Communism is a pretty deadly disease for any society. Apart from killing any drive to be productive and replacing it with a desire to screw over your employer, i.e. The State, authoritarian regimes come with a unique system of fostering corruption and cynicism.In order to advance in the ranks of a Communist-type party beyond the level of the low-ranking party plebs, someone needs to have dirt on you. That is in order to ensure your loyalty. If you don't co-operate, dirt surfaces and you get moved to some low level forgotten positions in lonely parts of the country. So it operates on loyalty, not on competence. Along with active measures to divide society and make people hate each other and worry about their day to day existence rather than about who calls the shots, it is a system that fosters corruption.The same people from the “2nd echelon” of the party - bureaucrats, secret police informers - tended to take over the leadership of countries as soon as the party leaders were disposed of. And then these emergency councils, having promised not to become political parties, promptly became social democrat parties.Add to that the fact that people who are raised under communist regimes learn to expect the state to provide for all their needs, and therefore are naturally biased towards social democracy. And cynical ex-communists love to take advantage of this, and of the low standards of people who are so poor (and *kept* in poverty) that you can win their vote with a bag of flour, a bottle of oil and nationalist TV shows.This answer is personal opinion, of course, drawing heavily on the situation of Romania.",234,6,187,32,0,0

1,Do you think the process of electing a president would work better if we did not have two parties like the Democrats and the Republicans? We would just have people voting for the person they deemed most qualified for the job.,Democratic Party vs. Republican Party,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"This sounds good in principle. Who needs parties, anyway? Let’s all just vote for the candidate with the best ideas!The reality is, however, that, regardless of what one might think of the currently existing parties in the U.S., political parties overall perform a number of important functions without which democratic political systems would struggle to function.Parties, at their core, provide an organizational framework. This is true both for individual voters and for elected officials. Take them out of the picture altogether and you’d have chaos. It is true that the U.S. constitution was written with the assumption there would be no political parties in the U.S. But it’s also true, as a number of political scientists and historians (including a former grad school professor of mine) have argued, that parties formed very quickly after the adoption of the U.S. Constitution in part because the system wouldn’t really have functioned without them.This question asks about presidential elections. I’ll get to that, but first let me talk about how legislatures would work (or not work) in the complete absence of political parties.In most legislative bodies, without political parties to organize members into voting blocs you’d have chaos. If, for example, the United States Congress consisted of 535 individual members across the two houses, each of which was a total free agent who could act entirely as he or she wished on every issue, accomplishing even the most basic functions would prove to be difficult. Choosing committee members and chairs, currently done by party caucuses in each chamber, would prove almost impossible, as many more members would want to serve on the “important” committees (like appropriations, judiciary or foreign relations) than there are seats on those committees, because being on those committees gives them greater influence over important issues that come before Congress. Right now, committee seats are given out in party caucuses according to seniority and/or the political needs of the members (members from heavily agricultural states will want to be on farming-related committees; members seen as rising stars and potential future presidential candidates might be put on foreign relations to give them foreign policy experience, etc.) and the chairs of the committees are members of the majority party. This might seem unimportant but it’s a major element of how Congress and the state legislatures do their business.And that’s before we get to how chaotic voting on bills would be without parties. Parties provide a basic organizational framework for negotiations on major legislation. Each party stakes out a position, and then work to either come to an agreement that is acceptable to at least a number of members in both camps that equal an overall majority of the chamber, or else will muster enough votes from the majority party to pass over the minority’s objections. It would be all but impossible to draft effective legislation without at least one side having the certain knowledge that they will have at least a significant number of their members willing to vote for it. Along the same lines, right now legislation is brought up to a vote in each chamber of Congress by the leadership of the majority party; the Speaker of the House determines whether a bill will receive a vote, and he or she is chosen by the majority; in the Senate the Majority Leader decides whether to hold a vote on a particular bill. This is part of how parties enact their agendas; they control what will and will not be voted on. But if all 535 members of Congress were free agents, free to write whatever legislation they wanted, choosing what to vote on would prove extremely difficult. There’s only so much time that can be spent on committee hearings, reports, floor debate and voting. There has to be some organizing principle behind what gets considered and what does not. Parties provide this.As for Presidential elections… well, look, like I said, it would be wonderful, in theory, to say, to heck with parties, vote for the candidate with the best ideas! But the reality is, the vast majority of voters do not pay enough attention to politics to know what the most important issues are or what the different candidates’ positions on those issues are. People just do not spend the time it takes to educate themselves in this way. Parties, however, provide them with a basic framework; a kind of shorthand, if you will, to understanding candidates and issues. If I know candidate X is from party Y, then I have a general idea of the kinds of issues he or she is likely to focus on if elected, and the kinds of policies relating to those issues they are likely to support. I also know whether I personally agree with the broad positions of candidate X because I know whether I agree with the broad positions of party Y. It simplifies the process of making a decision. And this is important, because as much as we might want people to decide things entirely for themselves, the simple, sad reality is that most of the time they simply will not. Faced with having to invest a lot of time and effort educating themselves on issues and on candidates’ unique positions without a partisan/ideological framework, most people will just check out; they won’t be involved at all. They will find it too difficult to know for whom to vote and will therefore not vote at all. We know this because this sense of uncertainty about how to make a decision is already a problem for some voters when you have parties; some people without a strong attachment to either party and without much interest in politics choose not to vote because they feel like they lack the information to make a choice. Take away the framework that provides most of the information voters currently have, and this will only get worse.Now, it may well be that in an ideal society, all people would weigh every public question in their own mind and make informed, intelligent, educated decisions entirely on their own. We do not live in such a society, and I can’t imagine that we ever will. So parties will continue to serve a vital function, whether we like the actual options presented by our existing parties or not (and that’s a different issue.)",398,14,4.2k,"1,843",0,0
1,Do you think the process of electing a president would work better if we did not have two parties like the Democrats and the Republicans? We would just have people voting for the person they deemed most qualified for the job.,Democratic Party vs. Republican Party,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Factions are inevitable. Political parties have developed in all major representative democracies. And, what is more, they have evolved in various forms — a “two-party system” being natural in first-past-the-post vote-counting systems.But the notion that there can be devised a system to ensure that the most-qualified person for the job gets the nod strikes me as more a product of hope than reason. People tend not to want the “best person” becausethey do not agree on what “best” is (or even who is “most qualified”), in no small part because“the most qualified” technically may very well be in obvious opposition to voters’ perceived interests and adopted ideologies, and becausevoters have little incentive to study the candidates dispassionately — their reason is under-developed because of “rational ignorance.”*Worse yet, many people actively want evil people to lead, because sometimes the corrupt and the corrupting are what makes a corrupt system switch through the gears of the State Machinery best.Arguably, both major-party candidates in the 2016 presidential elections were horribly unqualified: corrupt and incompetent, on the left hand (the spectacularly oversold Hillary Clinton), misguided and ignorant, on the right (the bizarrely latched-onto chaotician, Donald Trump). Unlike several other Quoran answerers, I do not think the Electoral College failed in 2016. It did what it was supposed to do: select a candidate with a wider diversity of support among the states. The reason someone unqualified got the nod was because the parties failed us.By nominating horrible candidates.So, given that we will not likely change the Constitutional system, what can be done?Perhaps the states could move to ranked choice voting for multi-candidate elections. Abandon the antiquated “first past the post” method that was mathematically proven a bad idea before the Constitution was written, by Condorcet. I am not certain the states could make the change without an Amendment — but by the original construction of the Consitution, they should be able to.The advantage of ranked choice voting is not only that more voters’ preferences would be served, but, more importantly, that the “wasted vote” incentive would be diminished, and with it the insulation of the dominant parties from those extra-party voters’ dissent. (I will not explain why unless people are interested. For now, I merely assert.) And with major parties now being influenced by a greater diversity of views, perhaps they will take the small extra incentive to actually engage in substantive debate and apply it to better policies and candidates.Well, it is an idea.I think time has come to use sortition (perhaps from the ranks of governors and senators) to select presidents, but I know that is going precisely nowhere.Regardless, it is obvious to me that standard-brand democratic action has proven its poverty.But it is not obvious to others. I know.So I will continue to criticize the quarterbacks from far back in the bleachers.* “Rational ignorance” is the term Public Choice economists use to explain why voters know so little — and believe such goofy things — about the workings of government. The idea is that, unlike in consumer purchases, voting provides little context for adequate feedback and learning. When you spend your own wealth on a purchase, you bear the direct consequences of a poor choice and have an opportunity to learn. But voters do not bear direct consequences. For example: I have never voted for a winning presidential candidate. So my selections did not yield me the normal consequence of “getting what I asked for” (obtaining a good by a political demand, in this case). So, what can I learn? Some voters take as learning a different choice so “their side” can “win.” But almost never does any voter’s choice affect the outcome. No direct feedback. So all voting is subject to the kind of reasoning we find in religion, with wild theories competing for attention. (I am not saying I am exempt from this.) This makes democracy subject to huge amounts of outrageous fantasy, bizarre conjecture, groupthink, virtue signalling, and other “tribal” dynamics. Voters by and large remain clueless because the system gives less information than do consumer markets. Or, for that matter, the more volatile financial and capital markets. Politics runs by passion and ignorance, and must. We try to compensate for this with philosophy and social science, but these have proved to be weak reeds against the winds of doctrine.",127,4,183,235,0,0

Since, of course, our system was deigned without them.It didn’t last long. George Washington was very anti-party, as he saw how they had artificially divided people throughout Europe. Smart guy. However, the first parties, the Federalists and the Democratic Republicans (who became the Democratic Party later on), were being formed during Washington’s first term. In fact, a big reason he took the second term was to provide more time to push against parties. That didn’t work, either.If you look at Parlimentary systems throughout much of Europe, which take political parties into account, they get around at least much of the problems we have here. For one, our system’s only points of stability are Zero Parties or Two Strong Parties. Sure, we have third parties, but none of those have been able to win a single electoral college vote in decades. They are hobby parties, running to disrupt, not with any serious plan to win the Presidency. Not even with any serious plan to build a real third party at the local and regional levels.There is no perfect voting system. No, seriously, it’s actually impossible to create a perfect voting system. This is called Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem. But our system, the First Past the Post System, is specifically flawed in that it creates a two party system, and because it missed in a very large way to represent the true will of the people.And of course, as the 2016 election demonstrated, people won’t necessarily vote for the most qualified person… it’s their choice, regardless of whether parties exist or not, though a non-party election would certainly offer more possible candidates.But the simple fact is that, pretty much in my voting lifetime (since 1980) in the Presidential election, the vote has gone for the most telegenic person. They guy who looked best on television, who looked best on stage. That’s a big problem with our year-and-a-half campaign. But it’s also telling you — a thing sociologists and successful candidates have figured out long ago — that elections are won largely on emotion. Not on facts, not, as it really ought to be, on the results of a really difficult job application that considers qualitications. Look at the 2016 election. Trump was pure emotion, zero qualifications. Clinton was stuff, overrehearsed, uncomfortable on stage, and perhaps the most qualified candidate in a generation or two. If voters are stupid with parties, they’ll likely be stupid without parties, though in different ways.",1.3k,22,5.1k,"3,634",0,0
1,Do you think the process of electing a president would work better if we did not have two parties like the Democrats and the Republicans? We would just have people voting for the person they deemed most qualified for the job.,Democratic Party vs. Republican Party,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"If we didn’t have two parties and the Electoral College to ensure that two or three large States didn’t tyrannize the rest of the United States, we could easily have 10 or 20 or more candidates for President, especially considering how many Senators and Congressmen lust for the job. In that scenario, the winner by plurality might actually get just 15% of the votes and if 60% of Americans voted (a good turnout), that would mean just 9% of Americans voted for the winner.That leaves 91% of Americans who did not vote for the now-President.If you think we have obstruction and bickering and hate-mongering now, just imagine how bad it would be with over 90% against the President. Such a “winner” would be totally unable to govern.Think on this next time you hear someone say how “useless” or “antiquated” the Electoral College is. The Electoral College forces candidates to gain a consensus not only of the popular vote overall, but of the geographic vote and state representation as well. Yes this is harder than just campaigning in three or four strong States and trying to stack the deck of the popular vote with dead people and illegals, but it assures that a President has the breadth of support of the American People to legitimately govern.The Founders were extremely intelligent, wise, and well-educated men who, to our great good fortune, gave us a wonderfully well-crafted Constitutional Republic, not a doomed democracy. “If”, as Ben Franklin warned, “we can keep it”. The problems we struggle with today are largely the result of flawed Supreme Court Justices who substituted political ideology for Constitutional integrity, and greedy, power-hungry politicians who have dragged our actual government step by step away from the excellent model given to us, in exactly the wrong directions of centralization of power and gradual but cumulative erosions of Liberty and Individual Rights that the Founders warned us to beware.",26,0,140,340,0,0

One of the longest lasting axioms in political science is Duverger's Law, named for the French social scientist Maurice Duverger. It states that any country with a first past the post election system (as nearly everything is in the US) will have a two party system. There are localities in the US where an alternate party is competitive, but only by supplanting one of the major parties there. Much of Portland, Maine is like this, with the Democrats's leading competition coming from Greens. Another reason the two current parties are likely to maintain hegemony for the foreseeable future is the relatively high degree of consensus in broad ideology the US has, compared to, say, Italy. Finally, primary elections, rare elsewhere, allow American parties to be ideologically flexible from place to place. Democrats in, say, Boston can run on a very different platform than a Democrat in a rural area in the South.",40,1,127,601,0,0

Third parties are useless (except as occasional spoilers) because we have a combined head of state/head of government elected separate from the legislative branch. There is thus no need to form coalition governments which is how third parties exercise their power usually. It’s possible that a new party could replace the Democrats or Republicans but that also seems unlikely since both parties have proven very adept at changing to absorb new challengers. The Democrats, for example, took on most of the platform of the Populists, while the Republicans have absorbed most of the issues of the American Independent Party (ie George Wallace’s vehicle in 1968).That being said, as weird as politics are lately, I can imagine a scenario where enough Republicans desert Trump in 2020 to form their own Conservative Party and leave him the husk of the GOP or maybe Trump himself bolts, but even then it’s hard to imagine the change lasting through the next election cycle.",34,1,92,503,0,0

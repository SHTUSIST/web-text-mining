1,"If you vote for some lesser evil, are you not implicitly admitting that there was no good candidate in the elections in a constituency of more than million citizens?",Lok Sabha (Lower House of Parliament of India),1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"The biggest problem of people is that they think they have only two choices in life- The Good and The Bad.However life is rather Shades of Grey.Every single person including a saint has a bias, greed, lust and opinion. That's human nature. You generally choose a person who has the same bias as you have.So what may be a good candidate for ten people might be a not-so-great candidate for fifty other people.So we always chose the lesser evil in politics, love and friendship. Perhaps only a child is born innocent/good because he/she doesn't know what's good and bad.",122,2,80,52,0,0
1,What’s the most unfair power the government granted itself?,Government Grants,Unfairness,Republican Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,"The government cannot grant itself special powers, as that would be Unconstitutional.However, the American government has in certain cases within itself subrogated powers. The worst examples are:The granting of various agencies of the Executive Branch by the Congress the creation of de facto law through Rules and Regulations, which have both the force and penalty of law. ie US Food And Drug Rules and Regulations and BATFE Rules and Regulations.The assumption by the Executive Branch of the power of law by Executive Proclamation. ie The Executive Proclamation by the Obama Administration on D.A.C.A., which when reversed by the current Trump Administration the original Proclamation was held by a Federal Court (wrongly in my opinion) to be Unconstitutional to reverse.The assumption by The Executive Branch of agreements signed to have the power of Treaties. ie The Iran Agreement and transfer of a hundred and fifty billion dollars in cash by the Obama Administration without Senate approval.These are all horrible developments outside of the framework of the Constitution and were never intended by the Founders, who gave Congress and Congress ONLY the power to create law, which still had to be signed by The President in order to be law.",55,1,237,"2,228",0,0
1,What’s the most unfair power the government granted itself?,Government Grants,Unfairness,Republican Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,"The body of criminal laws in the United States is very confusing, very vague and ambiguous, sometimes contradictory, and so extensive that no human being on the planet can know all of the laws on the books. Yet each and every citizen is expected to know all of these laws and could potentially be prosecuted for violating any of them, no matter how obscure.And that leads to two horrible problems:The only people who are not held responsible for knowing all of these laws all of the time is … law enforcement. And if our law enforcement makes an error in coming after a citizen for doing something that is not, in fact, illegal, there are no consequences to law enforcement because of immunity. The police and other law enforcement are entitled to immunity from the consequences of getting the law wrong. The rest of us? No immunity no matter how obscure or ambiguous the law.Because there are so many laws and so many people violating, criminal prosecutors have tremendous discretion in who they prosecute. This means minorities, or people holding unpopular opinions, are often singled out for prosecution since the prosecutor can “pick and choose” who is prosecuted. And prosecutors are entitled to absolute immunity under the law if they abuse or misuse this power.This is a form of tyranny that, if not brought under control, could bring down our whole system.",56,2,12,189,0,0

It gives the government, on the slightest pretense, to steal cash and other private property at will with no remuneration to its victims.Property is assumed to be “guilty” of whatever real or imagined “crimes” and can thus be seized and appropriated to various law enforcement agencies.The property then becomes another asset that can be used to steal additional money and property.And it can also be used to imprison more people for multitudes of victimless “crimes.” Now America has the highest incarceration rate in the world.More people are becoming slaves of the state.",26,2,8,94,0,0

1,How inefficient is US government spending really?,Government Spending,U.S. Federal Budget,Fiscal Policy,1!,1!,1!,"Original Question: How inefficient is US government spending really?No Original Question DetailsThank you for the A2A, Eli ver HaaghThis is really one doozy of a question. And the answer, as it turns out, is in the framing of the answerer.And then another complicating factor is when one draws in comparisons to the private sector. There is a certain segment of people who act as if private sector spending is one-hundred percent efficient.Except that we know that is far from the case. One look at American landfills ought to convince anyone of that. One drive around town on New Year’s morning ought to convince anyone of that.We do not really have a standard of efficient spending, mostly by virtue of the difficulty of defining one.If we look at the most profitable firms, we find over and over and over again that firms grow not by reducing costs, but by increasing revenues faster than costs.So for a private firm, there is always the profitability measure—so long as profits continue to increase, the spending is difficult to question.Of course, if profits start going south, that is a different story.In that respect, it resembles the management of the Major League Baseball team. When your team is winning, it’s fun and cute. When they are not, it’s distracting and destructive.So really, when one comes down to it, the question appears to have a laudable goal—perhaps we can get that “crazy government spending” under control, and to do that, we need to know just how crazy it is.But keep in mind we are dealing with human beings—you know, the people who invented crazy.So really, I do not know what to tell you other than to be like everyone else and make up your own bullshit measure.",149,3,542,"1,680",0,1
1,How inefficient is US government spending really?,Government Spending,U.S. Federal Budget,Fiscal Policy,1!,1!,1!,"It depends on the agency, and the degree of contracting out tasks the agency on its own can’t accomplish.Social Security, for example is quite efficient, operating with an overhead estimated to be about 2%. It has no “CEO making $75Million-per-year,” but rather a cabinet-level administrator making considerably less that $500,000 per-year. Likewise, it has no expensive board of directors, expensive CFO, vice-presidents, and so on.The IRS is another example of a government agency that operates with a minimal overhead. Ditto for most other government agencies.Then you get into those agencies that employ a ton of private contractors, like Defense. This is where you get fighter jets that always exceed budget and start life with numerous deficiencies that require expensive re-engineering, duplication of efforts, $800 toilet seats, $90 hammers, and the list goes on. These are the agencies that the parasites of the American economy grow fat on, defense contractors. This, btw, is one of the few ways that a Congressman can “bring jobs back home,” so it’s no small wonder that the Defense budget is grossly bloated. A lot of defense spending is a way to reward voters in a particular district for their votes, not a true “necessity for national defense.”It’s my considered opinion that government by itself usually, actually runs pretty efficiently. It’s when you open up the government to capitalism and contractors that costs get totally out of hand.A good example of this going forward is likely to be the wall that President Trump wants to build. It will, of course, be built by contractors. Estimated at $25 Billion, its cost will likely balloon to closer to $100 Billion, if past performance is any indication, and when it’s all said and done, the border patrol won’t save one nickel on patrolling the border, while the total number of illegal immigrants would likely fall, they’ll continue to flood the border using ladders, tunnels, and simply walking to those areas without a wall, and I predict that not one nickels worth of illegal drugs crossing the border will be reduced since those smugglers will simply build more tunnels, use drones to go over the wall, and submarines and planes to go around it. The President will, of course, declare victory, contractors will make a ton of money, and in the end, sustainably little will be accomplished. All of which assumes that Congress actually funds the wall, which seems diminishingly less and less likely. Why? Because business profit enormously from the cheap labor crossing the border, and the Republican party always follows the money that business interests contribute to them. In other words, a Republican Congress is unlikely to kill the goose that lays golden eggs.",1k,10,432,"3,594",0,0
1,How inefficient is US government spending really?,Government Spending,U.S. Federal Budget,Fiscal Policy,1!,1!,1!,"EXTREMELY Inefficient.The US military is an excellent example.The US military budget is just shy of $600 Billion annually.An estimated 20% of that (over $100 Billion) is wasteful or unnecessary spending and does not benefit the US except to create jobs and give people paychecks. But as a nation, it doesn’t really accomplish anything.The US military has already done its own budget calculations and found that it could cut at least $60 Billion with no loss to ability, just getting rid of wasteful spending.But if it does that, then it gives congress an excuse to cut even more than that from the budget, so instead nothing gets cut.Some corporate type was hired to do a budget check a few years ago and found $115 Billion in excess that could be cut- His report was buried.Now to be fair- you cannot run the military like a corporation. So $115 Billion is probably too much to cut and still remain at its current level of effectiveness.But the $60 Billion number the military provided is probably not enough.Unfortunately, if the US Military wants something funded, it goes to ask for more money rather than reapportioning what it already has.Rather than divert $5 Billion from wasteful spending, instead it will push congress for a $10 Billion funding increase.The Nimitz class super carriers which are already costing over $12 Billion a piece are an excellent example.Despite the fact that many military individuals believe these craft to be gigantic floating targets, despite the fact that a working model has yet to be built, despite the fact that even basic functions such as arresting gear are not even functional, when the budget cap for them was reached, more was requested from congress. For some strange reason I have yet to figure out, DJT has even promised to increase the number of these behemoth cash burners by a few, even though most everyone paying attention thinks that money and resources would be much more intelligently spent on crafts like battleships/subs/etc.So those things as a whole are basically a perfect example of inefficient Gov Spending to the tune of over ten billions dollars USD per craft.M-1 Abrams and F-35’s are another great example of inefficient Gov spending.I would also recommend researching “Iron Triangles” in the US for more examples.",712,1,220,"2,410",0,0

However it kind of rattles you that 37 cents of every dollar of tax you pay goes to keep the pot boiling in many homes.The 16% money spend on Military may line the pockets of some defence contractors but that money forms a small part of the total spend.

1,How inefficient is US government spending really?,Government Spending,U.S. Federal Budget,Fiscal Policy,1!,1!,1!,"It depends upon what you mean by “inefficient.”The federal government is Monetarily Sovereign. It has the unlimited ability to create dollars, which it does by spending.Federal spending always adds dollars to the economy and federal taxing always subtracts dollars from the economy. Even so-called “wasteful” federal spending is stimulative and all federal taxing is recessive.The federal government even could stimulate the economy by dropping dollars onto cities from helicopters. (I won’t get into the “inflation” argument, here.)Clearly however, efficient spending will be more stimulative than inefficient spending, again depending on the meaning of “efficient.”By contrast, state and local governments are monetarily non-sovereign. Their spending and taxing does not affect the nation’s money supply.",120,1,85,328,0,1

People who would never listen to a Republican will then listen. Minorities who were raised on the Republican boogyman will come to know and admire their Republican neighbor.I personally helped run a campaign for a woman who would have been the first black woman mayor of one of the town's claiming to be the birthplace of the Republican party. She was raised as a Democrat. She had worked in state government as a Democrat. Her family were all Democrats. But the county Republican women's auxiliary showed up when she moved to town and made sure she got settled and was taken care of, so she became a Republican.Minorities will be better represented in the Republican party when Republicans get their hands dirty serving those communities.",65,3,44,43,0,0

Far too often I see this question asked in the form of “why don’t more POC vote for Republicans?” with the implication that there’s something wrong with them because they don’t vote for you.But all snark aside, it’s a serious suggestion.

We never know if they will ever reunite again.I can't even imagine what will be going through in the minds of these parents and children at this time. I'm not in support of illegal immigrants and I'm sure it must be causing problem for the United States( I'm not denying that at all) however separating little children from their parents will scar them for life and who knows if these parents can ever find the way that will lead to their children who are being snatched away from their bosoms, clinging on to them.

12,What is something that needs to be said about families being separated at the border?,U.S. Immigrant Children Separated From Parents (2018),1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"It represents a clear shift by Trump toward authoritarianism, and makes clear that he is a leader that takes pleasure in causing children pain in this instance as a show of his own dominance and power. He has dehumanized those little kids so they don't exist as real people in his eyes (else he would not be able to stomach what he is doing). Dehumanization is a crucial and necessary step in moving toward racism, xenophobia, human rights abuses, and genocide. Families risking everything seeking asylum are now sent to jail or kept in cages. The pattern is a really familiar one in history, where the leader so enjoys his own power, control and dominance that he is willing to see a vast human price paid for it.The forced separation of small children from their parents - a clear transgression of human rights - is a choice by Donald Trump and can be stopped at any time. For someone to be so desperately inhumane - and for a coterie of acolytes and colluders to allow this - takes us back to pre-WWII Germany style leadership. The visceral emotional pull a regular person feels when they see the images and hear the audio of those little ones is the stuff of nightmares, and a failure to feel those feelings represents a major personality disorder alongside an authoritarian desire to use force and fear to control people, especially minorities.Nothing I say here is sensationalistic, just a representation of facts, but what really needs to be said is that if you continue to support Trump, you stand behind his inhumane forced removal of little children from their parents, leaving them sobbing and alone, frightened and possibly in foster care for the rest of their lives, their parents jailed for simply trying to escape from some kind of hellhole that they left.

They’re being trafficked.Historically, children are afraid to tell someone about an abuser or kidnapper unless they’re separated from them.Campaigning to stop the separation of “parents” from their children at the border is removing the chance for trafficked children to escape their trafficker and receive help from the U.S. government.This policy was enacted over 30 years ago, it isn’t new. Trump didn’t create it, it was happening during the Obama, Bush, and Clinton administrations.Therefore, illegal immigrant parents knew the risk they were taking of being separated from their children well before they illegally entered the U.S.The Mexican cartel controls over 95% of illegal immigration into the U.S. through the Mexican border.This policy is necessary to fight sexual slavery in the U.S. which is higher than ever.[1] Human trafficking in Mexico - Wikipedia",3.6k,66,2.8k,77,0,1

2,What is something that needs to be said about feminism in the United States?,Feminism,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"I never thought I'd be writing half of what I am about to, but I've just realised I don't have to bend to others' will when discussing feminism. A very American sentiment, no? With that being said:A letter to the American feminists—Never compromise your ideas in the name of gaining allies to fight a bigger war. The enemy of your enemy isn't your friend, they just use you so that there's one less enemy less for them to fight once they turn their attention to you.Feminists of America: when there is a new idea about feminism that you haven't heard before, but is getting pushed as ""the next big thing"" in feminism: learn whether it matches with your values and respond accordingly. Guilting yourself into accepting rhetoric you dislike in the name of the cause is how oppression forms. You can oppose what you don't like about #MeToo while remaining a feminist. Your ideas are not wrong, merely unpopular.Women achieved feminist aims all throughout the world with nobody's permission. Men (and women) have hated feminism as long as it has existed and will continue to hate it perpetually. Don't take dissent too personally; haters are going to hate.Correcting the behaviour of businesses and corporations is a good strategy. It is easy to verify what they've done, and it usually results in an indisputably good outcome. Using public scenarios as a way to teach others can be a good strategy, but only if they care about their image. Lawsuits and court cases offer teachable moments to explain why they are happening- someone might think it is a non-issue that a boss fired an employee for not dating them, after all. Someone who doesn't want to be known in that way would probably change their act, but note what happened to Donald Trump, and how little he suffered when women accused him of sexual assault. Be wary of these situations.There's a war going on between choice-oriented feminism and goal-oriented feminism. Know where you stand and why.I mean that in the highest sense from earlier, about guilt and the need to resist it. There is a valid argument to be made that women within Islam who wear the Hijab have internalised willingly their oppression and have accepted the demeaning rhetoric spoken by certain men within Islam, and need to be forced to achieve true liberation.[1]After all, a woman in the 1960s criticising early feminists for not staying in the kitchen would be ridiculed today. She would have been repeating the talking points of the patriarchy, and if everyone agreed with her the US would have never seen women liberated from the home and their gender roles.Some feminists might think that she's actively hurting the cause, and because she is an obstacle to advancement, she is no better than the sexist society she supports… but in thinking this, you're negating her beliefs, blaming her against the ""ideal woman"" who acts nice and supports all the right policies… a gender role she isn't comforming to. Can feminism claim only some women deserve to voice their opinions? Is it nothing more than ""if you're not with us, you're against us""? Are all women equal, only some are more equal than others?That's where we get the idea that ""trans women/feminine women/married women can't be real feminists"". Traitors to their gender. And that is my issue with goal-oriented feminism.But if you believe this, follow your belief to the last letter even in the face of my disapproval. This is crucial for your perspective on feminism to live on and for feminism in general to survive being destroyed by those who wish it destroyed… even if they think you're the one destroying it.Then there's choice-oriented feminism. I think back to Ayn Rand's saying: you can't force people to be free. There is also a valid argument to be made that because wearing the Hijab is what she wants, it is moral. To force her to give up headcoverings would be to claim you know better than she does, which makes you no better than the oppressive society that claimed the exact same thing in the past.Yet this type of feminism is oddly similar to libertarianism- if a person and their boss consent to a $0,05/hour wage, that's clearly acceptable to this type of feminism, since it would be immoral to force them to be free. One person's oppression is the other's vision of the good life, of course… But we can all see it's a horrible contract. We (as feminists) want to believe it's right in theory, but we (as humans) object to it in practice. This is my biggest problem with choice-oriented feminism.So if you're in a discussion with someone, and they start talking about the dangers of the Burqa, know where their allegiance lies and how to approach, agree with and disagree with them.Feminism must move beyond the feel-good purpose that it has acquired in the United States. For an analogy, as a prospective historian who used to write about the subject on Quora, I've encountered plenty of people who see answers talking about the Byzantine Empire and comment ""but it was actually the Roman Empire!""As if they thought dear goodness, this knowledge changes my life! The Byzantine Empire was still the Roman Empire and I shall tell everyone about it so it can change theirs too, as if it were a life-altering fact.To which I say: The Byzantine Empire is now known as the Roman Empire… now what? We've just completed step one. You've corrected the myth. Now we have work to do, the hard work of changing historiography to recognise a Roman legitimacy that Gibbon left out. Rediscover the merits of an empire long considered the sad, pathetic remnant of its former self. Do everything that you need to in order to change the narrative. But merely calling it the Roman Empire is shorthand for all the tough work you aren't doing.It's the same with feminism, where the thing to say these days is that ""feminism is about gender equality"". To which I say, once again: so feminism is about gender equality… now what? You've corrected the myth. You've taken step one. Now comes your hard work: electing people into office, changing opinions, showing by your merits that it is about gender equality. Don't just debate anti feminists, debate other feminists.And above all, don't dare partner with the enemy of your enemy. Only when you follow your feminism can it truly be achieved.Footnotes[1] France's burqa ban upheld by human rights court",284,1,586,"1,203",0,1

The Soviet Union never made it there. Union of Soviet SOCIALIST Republics. At the end of the day, there is no difference, IN OUTCOMES, between Socialism, Marxism and Communism.They fail because they crush the human spirit and ignore human nature. They require governments to fix prices, ignoring the profit incentive while removing all accountability and at the same time trampling private ownership of property.Socialism and Communism have proven throughout history to be a failed systems. They have evolved from early day Utopians to Marxist revolutionaries to modern day democratic socialist infiltrators.Let’s look at how they have evolved:Karl MarxSocialism requires 4 basic elements:No Private Property or InheritanceSteeply Graduated Income TaxCentral Control (healthcare, utilities, banking)Free Public EducationThen during the Cold war, Socialists realized that Capitalism was winning so Anthony Crosland (a Fabian socialists) wrote - ""The Future of Socialism.” The idea was to essentially and slowly infiltrate capitalism. What we now call “Crony Capitalism.So, they rebranded communism (Democratic Socialism as Lenin would referred to it in the late 19 Teens) — instead of communism, there was a new reformed Socialism.Socialism called for under Anthony Crosland and the Fabian Socialists.Progressive income taxFree public educationFree healthcareExpanded social securityIn this form of socialism, private property was required because it the collectivization wasn’t working in Russia; well, that and it scared people. Instead of the traditional communist revolution it was socialist infiltration.Now, let’s take a look at our good friend, the self proclaimed Democratic Socialist, Bernie Sanders. Let’s also ignore the fact that Lenin sold communism to the Russian people as Democratic Socialism, because that is just a mere coincidence.Here are the things that Bernie Sanders stand for:Redistribution of wealthProgressive income taxCentral Control (private property but with direction and regulatory control by feds)Free healthcareFree public educationExpanded social securityNow, you might be asking yourself, what are the Bold and Bold Italics in the lists above? Well, everything in the first list is in Bold. Anything from the first list that appears in the subsequent lists are in Bold. Those that show up for the first time the second list are in Bold Italics, as such those new items that appear in the third list are a Bold Italics.Aren’t there some odd similarities? Everything from the 1st and 2nd list is in the expanded Bernie Sanders list; yet people say he isn’t a “real socialist” despite the entire Democratic Party agreeing with these 6 pillars as central to their party platform.Now, some are going to argue — What about Sweden. What about it? It is surely the most developed welfare state in the world, right — Yes, it probably is. So let’s take a look at Sweden and its “State of the Union” for a moment.Sweden is about to collapse under it's own weightSweden’s population is only 8 million people, about the size of the city of ManhattanSweden has the highest tax rates in the world. US averages 25% for the middle incomes where Swedes average 60% ONLY for their income tax. They still have a payroll tax and value added tax on purchases.Swedes earn 20% less than we do in America and pay 50-100% more for goodsThe average Swedish home is 800 sqftIkea was started in Sweden, but in order to make it, the owner moved to SwitzerlandThe Swedes have free college tuition — BUT in order to qualify fir free tuition, you have to move away and separate yourself from your family. Grants and loans go instead to paying for living expenses. Swedes then graduate with some the highest student debt in the world and make less money than graduates in other countries.Man, if Socialism was explained in this way — how many people would say they still want it? Add the 100 million lives that were taken in the 20th century to achieve the Socialist Utopia only to fall into Communist Revolution — and man, we have the trifecta — what however many we stopped counting at.But that’s just my two cents for the conversation.Many parts of this answer have come from my own prior answers on Socialism: Bryce Ebeling's answer to Why do so many people in the USA today, mostly young people, say that they want socialism to replace our current form of government?",341,9,164,551,0,0

The only real question about Trump is whether is need for attention or his desire for enriching himself are paramount, though they do function perfectly in tandem. Ronald Reagan did love this country and did believe in its ideals, and that was one of the reasons he was popular. He was able to tap into the love of country that most Americans profess, though how that manifests itself is obviously complex and the source of conflict in our country.

2,How much had the Republican Party changed from Lincoln times? Would Lincoln be a Republican on modern times? Why?,U.S. Democrats,Abraham Lincoln,Bernie Sanders,1!,1!,1!,"The Republican party, starting in 1856 with John C. Fremont, was the progressive party, with a progressive platform which was anti-slavery, pro-labor union, federal construction of infrastructure (rail roads and the telegraph), and free public education.With the official end of reconstruction, the Republican party no longer had a popular, progressive agenda, and their support of the railroad barons was becoming distasteful. The Republican party went up for sale. It was purchased by a relatively few oligarchs, and they got William McKinley elected to president, by throwing money at his campaign, and voter suppression.After McKinley was assassinated just after his re-election, Theodore Roosevelt became president, and he was an old time Lincoln type Republican. He returned the party to progressive thinking ( anti-trust, infrastructure building, anti-corruption etc.) for a short while. The new Republican party will eventually reject him. He will attempt to run again as and independent, progressive, “Bull Moose.”Since then, the bought and paid for Republican party has never presented a coherent party platform. What they really want is not particularly good for a voting population, so it is twisted and idealized, with a squinty eyed, kind of rhetoric and catchy slogans. Many people actually think that double, sugar coated cocoa puffies are good for them.Few people can understand what the core of the Republican party really wants, and that is by design. For a country with vast oceans on both sides, and no invasion threat possible since 1812, the only reason for a huge, peace time military was to protect the overseas holding of the oligarchs. That became possible following WW 2, with Communism, and the domino theory, as the danger. Having a almost a dozen super-carriers (the rest of the world has none) is not exactly a real good anti-terrorist solution, but they do project power for overseas businesses.Everything else in the Republican party is about what they don’t like. Not surprisingly, what they don’t like are taxes, and any social problem solving measures, except prisons, and death by destitute aging, or untreated health problems.Lincoln would now be a Progressive Democrat.",309,3,470,"1,115",0,0
2,How much had the Republican Party changed from Lincoln times? Would Lincoln be a Republican on modern times? Why?,U.S. Democrats,Abraham Lincoln,Bernie Sanders,1!,1!,1!,Lincoln’s Republicans were the party of Northern Industrial interests and that made them essentially Progressive in the sense of favoring Technology and social change. Teddy Roosevelt was a Republican in this tradition and the founder of the Progressive movement in American Politics.The Democrats held the South and were generally the Conservative party in the sense of resisting change or backing traditional values.This started to change in the 1960’s. Eisenhower (R) got the Civil Rights revolution going but Kennedy (D)and Johnson (D) really implemented the major change. That began the shift of Southern Whites from Democrats to Republicans which gradually shifted the political center of gravity of both parties.Before this FDR was a Democrat and a Progressive in the tradition of his Republican distant cousin Teddy but that was kind of anomalous. It didn’t change the actual party bases of support. FDR just appealed to a big majority that encompassed part of both parties bases.,28,1,19,592,0,0

6,What's so bad about Republicans?,Republican Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Noam Chomsky has correctly characterized the Republican Party as the greatest threat to human civilization in history.Noam Chomsky on why the Republican Party is the most 'dangerous organisation in human history'The reason is that they are no longer a parliamentary organisation trying to pass laws to deliver benefits to their constituents. Rather, they are an organisation bent on deliberately hastening the destruction of mankind.Chomsky, professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, argued the administration was prioritising “profits and power” and “systematically” destroying governmental institutions, such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy, which are in place to address global warming.“Has there ever been an organisation in human history that is dedicated, with such commitment, to the destruction of organised human life on Earth?” he asked the audience at a Democracy Now! event.“Not that I’m aware of. Is the Republican organisation - I hesitate to call it a party - committed to that? Overwhelmingly. There isn’t even any question about it.”Chomsky believes - as do many others - that the Republican Party poses a unique and existential threat to human life on earth because of their refusal to take seriously the threat of Climate Change and their willingness to risk nuclear war, and because they are motivated not just by the base desires of avarice and self-enrichment, but by a fanatical devotion to biblical fundamentalism that dictates the End Times and the destruction of the world.Many people wonder why the GOP refuses to consider some parts of the scriptures, such as the duty of mankind to be “good stewards” of the earth. This is because the Bible, like the Koran and every other book of religious doctrine, contains wildly diverse dictats and instructions for how to live, what constitutes good and bad, and so on.The GOP of today has become a Death Cult. And I mean this in the most literal of terms. Republicans in Congress and the White House (Mike Pence) believe in the End Times. This is why they are such fanatical supporters of Israel. But to understand today’s GOP, you need to look at just the example of the recent move of the US Embassy to Jerusalem.The Trump Administration moved the US Embassy to Jerusalem in an act that was widely hailed by Israelis everywhere as a great achievement. However, the religious leaders that were invited to give speeches at the opening event were:Rev. Robert Jeffress: he believes that “Jews cannot be saved” and that they are all doomed to hell. He supports the move of the Embassy because it will hasten the End Times, the Second Coming and/or the Rapture that will bring all true Christians to Heaven.Pastor Who Thinks Jews Are Going To Hell Speaks At Jerusalem Embassy OpeningRev. John Hagee: he believes that God sent Hitler to kill the Jews and thereby hasten the return of the Jewish survivors to the Holy Land. He literally believes that the Holocaust was part of God’s Plan, and that it was a good thing.Critics Question Whether Pastor Who Said Hitler Was Sent by God Was Good Choice to Speak at U.S. Embassy in IsraelThe one thing both these Pastors have in common is their shared belief that the End Times are almost upon us, and Christians everywhere should rejoice. The idea that we should somehow worry about future generations of humans - let alone the survival of the biosphere itself - is laughable to them.The fact that they were allowed to speak at the ceremony - and were celebrated by Netanyahu and his cronies, as well as Jared Kushner, Steve Mnuchin and other Jewish Trump officials - shows just how Machiavellian these people are. They are willing to support religious zealots and a Cult of Death in order to achieve short term political goals.Just Google “Republican” and “Climate Change” and “God” and you get stories like this:Lawmaker thinks God will ‘take care’ of climate change if it becomes a ‘real problem’Inhofe says God’s in charge on climate, but what if he’s wrong?Republicans reject climate change fears despite rebukes from scientistsTo sum up: today’s GOP is dangerous because they are a bunch of religious zealots who literally form a Death Cult. Whether that Death arrives in the form of climate change catastrophes or nuclear holocaust is, in the end, unimportant to them.Republicans believe that their God wishes and plans to destroy the world, and anything that they can do to hasten that destruction is a good and holy endeavor.To me, that’s pretty bad.",10.1k,890,187,103,0,7
6,What's so bad about Republicans?,Republican Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"A2A. Republicans generally? A lot of them are genuinely decent and good people whom I disagree with about how the country should be run.The people currently running the Republican party, however, are moral imbeciles. And there is a segment of the party, probably best described as “movement conservatives”, who are right behind them cheering them on.What’s so bad?They think of people as things. The number of Republicans I’ve had in the last week tell me personally that if children are being separated from their parents at the border it’s 100% the fault of the parents is easily in double digits. They would never take that attitude if their own kid were mistreated by the police after committing a misdemeanor. But it’s OK because they don’t actually know any of the people it’s happening to. They simply have a completely different moral calculus for people they know, or who they perceive as being “like them.” Another example: look at the number of Republicans who have had sudden changes of heart about gay rights after a member of their family came out. Once it affected them directly, well, that was different.They are economically insane. Again, not all Republicans, but a lot of them and virtually everyone who’s making policy. Their economics are largely based on a curve drawn on a cocktail napkin by Art Laffer. His idea is trivially true, but without development and research it’s useless in determining policy. Yet not only do they swear by it, they seem to be of the opinion that no matter what the tax rate is, it’s always above the peak in the curve, so every Republican tax cut proposal is sold with a heavy dose of “revenues will increase, so it will pay for itself”. That’s what we were told about the recent tax cut as part of the argument for lowering corporate tax rates, that the resulting increased economic activity would more than pay for the cut. We’re six months in and corporate tax receipts are down by something around 30%.Their only real moral issue is abortion. Oh, they’ll talk about other things, but when it comes to action it’s very clear that the only thing that really motivates them is abortion. I almost understand this one. If you really believe that abortion is murder and look at the number of abortions, yeah, that’s a pretty big deal. But virtually all of them also are willing to make exceptions in the cases of rape and incest. How’s that again? Incest makes murdering an innocent OK? It just doesn’t add up.They are openly hostile not just to science, but to the very idea of objective truth. Led by Trump, they seem to think it simply doesn’t matter whether they lie as long as their statements are useful.They have attracted a significant number of racists, white supremacists, and outright neo-Nazis and don’t seem terribly concerned about any part of that except the potential embarrassment of it being made public. Personally, if I found that a significant number of white supremacists were agreeing with a group I was associated with, I’d want to understand what it is about the group that’s attracting them and most probably seen about changing it.Now. If you’re getting ready to click the comment button and write a scathing “not all Republicans” response, don’t bother. I will delete it. Simply not interested in having that discussion. I said right up front that I know not all Republicans are like this.

Calling on the words of Christ to undermine Christ.Is the Republican Party not the Party of the Antichrist?Understand this answer is intended to be hyperbole, but it boils down to this, the Republicans are the antithesis of Christianity and use the religion to skew the message.In all forms, the Republicans are destroying everything, they are killing the environment, they are trying to cause Armageddon, and they are twisting it into a tool to wage a campaign against the weakest Americans.The Republican Party is the Antichrist.However, good news for everyone else.And the devil who had deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet were, and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever. — Revelation 20:10",126,6,140,"2,329",0,2

Conservative values are vital in making America a great country because of ideas such as capitalism, 2nd amendment, strong military, and originalism. In reality democrats seem to be a larger threat to society now days. Even since the Vietnam war the democratic party would rather sabotage a potential success lead by the Republican Party than support what’s nesscary in order to make the United states of America great.Today the majority of modern liberals are in support of socialist ideas and are beginning to push the idea of universal income. Capitalism is a major component of what makes America great. We should all work hard in order to achieve success instead of expecting a handout. If you hate capitalism because of greedy business men then the joke is one you because in a socialist system they end up benifitng more and the poor end up benefiting less. Do you think a millionare in the 1900s is richer than a millionaire today? What people don’t consider when answering this question is the innovation that occurs within capitalist systems. Innovations in medicine, entertainment,transportation, communication and every other industry can make life a lot more enjoyable today than it would be in the past and we can now own a lot more from each industry now than we could in 1910. Innovation is an asset which cannot exsist without capitalism. Now ask yourself what did the average Cuban have in 2005 that they didn’t have in 1959?The 2nd amendment is an other vital aspect of what makes the United States of America great. This amendment protects every other amendment in the constitution because governments respect people with the ability to own guns more than people who can’t legally own guns. The moment we give up all our guns politicians would have more power to push crazy ideas like socialism. One thing that democracts seem to be running on more lately is laws which serve and protect those with poor mental health yet when brought up in a gun control debate it is quickly swept under the rug. A dracmatically larger number of students are dieing from suicide than being shot and no one really seems to care about those lives.

There have been such celebrations going back to Greek and Roman times, celebrating mother gods. The origin of Mother’s day in the UK and other European countries was the fourth Sunday in Lent and was a return to your mother church if you were working away from that area. It was a religious event but also permitted apprentices and women in service to return home to their mother’s as they were released by their ‘masters’ to return for Mothering Sunday. Over time it became associated with maternal mother rather than the mother church.Mothers day in the US seems to have been started by Anne Jarvis in the 1860s to reconcile Union and Confederate soldiers and in 1873 campaigned for it to become a Mother’s Peace Day. When adopted she then campaigned against it due to its change in nature and commercialisation.The UK Mothering Sunday service predates the American practice by over three hundred years. The American commercial mothering Sunday was merged in practice with the Church of England’s mothering Sunday subsequent to the second world war. The religious service does, however, continue to this day. The UK retains the fourth Sunday in Lent as the date of celebrating mother’s day rather than the US date which has now moved to the second Sunday in May.Given that mother’s day is just as commercial as father’s day there seems to be no purpose in having either event other than to promote the sale of cards, chocolates and boost phone company revenues. My father would, however, have been disappointed not to get his usual quota of rude cards and alcohol that he gets on father’s day. As such both days provide an opportunity to show your love and/or respect for your parents or persons that have adopted these roles.I am not sure why missing fathers is a reason to get rid of father’s day. I no longer have a mother, so mother’s day has ended for me. I do not see that as a reason to abandon the celebration for others. If a parent is missing/dead the day would not be celebrated. I guess (as I am not knowledgeable in this area) in families with same sex parents would either have a double celebration for mother’s day or father’s day as appropriate unless the family adopted father/mother roles or perhaps just ignored the event.

But in the Jim Crow South, few of them were able to vote without risking their lives. The Klan had a way of taking care of blacks who were so uppity that they’d exercise their right to vote.John F. Kennedy tried to enact a civil rights bill but died before he could. Lyndon Johnson pushed it through Congress by framing it as a memorial to his martyred predecessor. In response, blacks began registering to vote, mostly as Democrats.To your specific question: Japanese-Americans know that Franklin Roosevelt is long dead, so they don’t blame today’s Democratic Party for what FDR did. But if they were going to assign blame, the Republicans wouldn't get off scot-free: Earl Warren, then the Republican governor of California, pushed for internment.And the reparations paid under Reagan were so piddling as to be an insult: $20,000 to everyone still alive who was interned. Of course thousands of Japanese-Americans had died in the decades after 1945. And many of them held California real estate worth millions today because they were forced to sell it quickly, before they were sent to the camps. Their descendants lost fortunes that way.The first Japanese to come to the United States were recruited to work farm fields in Hawaii. Though not interned during World War II, they were systematically discriminated against and shut out of political power by Hawaii’s white elite.Their response was to volunteer for the 442nd Infantry Regiment in World War II, the most decorated unit in the history of American warfare. When they returned home, they became Democrats because the Republican Party still didn’t welcome them. Unabashedly running on their war records, they swept to power in Hawaii, which has been a blue territory and state ever since.Their success, and the high profile of nisei politicians like Daniel K.

To understand this completely, you ought to study the career of FDR and the man. Here is a start:Franklin D. Roosevelt - WikipediaNote that:FDR attended Groton School, Harvard College, and Columbia Law School, and went on to practice law in New York City. In 1905, he married his fifth cousin once removed, Eleanor Roosevelt. They had six children. He won election to the New York State Senate in 1910, and then served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy under President Woodrow Wilson during World War I.Assistant Secretary of the Navy is a major political appointment. Very much not a “nothing” job. It is not quite a cabinet level posting. FDR was related to Teddy Roosevelt and a scion of a very political family.So was the Wilson administration racist much?The Racist Legacy of Woodrow WilsonAs president, Wilson oversaw unprecedented segregation in federal offices. It’s a shameful side to his legacy that came to a head one fall afternoon in 1914 when he threw the civil-rights leader William Monroe Trotter out of the Oval Office.How the black middle class was attacked by Woodrow Wilson’s administrationRacism had always been a part of life in Washington and its government buildings, but the U.S. civil service had never been formally segregated prior to Wilson’s inauguration.( . . .)After the Civil War, thousands of African Americans took the national civil service examination and pulled political strings to land good jobs with decent pay in federal offices. That route to social mobility for educated and hard-working black Americans was closed off by the time Wilson convinced Americans to fight for democracy in World War I.(. . .)Wilson’s administration saw not just the end of a few careers of black Republicans and its impact was not merely the result of one man’s prejudice.Instead, in its attack on a nationally known and symbolic black middle class, “federal segregation” signaled the U.S. government’s support for a national racial regime in which African Americans were not only politically disfranchised but also professionally and economically hobbled.Black men and women who worked in Washington, DC, at the turn of the 20th century were functional members of the national government doing the nation’s business. Their numbers grew steadily well into the new century, as I have detailed in my book, Racism in the Nation’s Service. In 1912, every dollar printed by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing bore the signature of James C. Napier, a black man who served as Register of the Treasury.Woodrow Wilson was extremely racist — even by the standards of his timeWoodrow Wilson was, in fact, a racist pig. He was a racist by current standards, and he was a racist by the standards of the 1910s, a period widely acknowledged by historians as the ""nadir"" of post–Civil War race relations in the United States.Easily the worst part of Wilson's record as president was his overseeing of the resegregation of multiple agencies of the federal government, which had been surprisingly integrated as a result of Reconstruction decades earlier. At an April 11, 1913, Cabinet meeting, Postmaster General Albert Burleson argued for segregating the Railway Mail Service. He took exception to the fact that workers shared glasses, towels, and washrooms. Wilson offered no objection to Burleson's plan for segregation, saying that he ""wished the matter adjusted in a way to make the least friction.""Both Burleson and Treasury Secretary William McAdoo took Wilson's comments as authorization to segregate.This is the Administration that FDR joined in 1913, and served until 1920. Note he took an active part in segragation of the Navy Department.Screenshot of story from newspaper “Chicago Defender” 15 October 1932, during the last bit of the 1932 presidential election. The “Chicago Defender” was a black owned & operated newspaper intended for a black audience.Nor were bathrooms in the building the only thing FDR segregated at that post. He ran long service highly qualified black petty officers out of the Navy. He did so on wholly racist grounds, regardless of the damage done to combat readiness and military capability of the US Navy — during the lead up to US involvement in WWI. In other words, during a wartime situation.Note also, FDR did not undo even one of the racist acts of the Wilson administration. That had to wait for Truman.I think it rather obvious that FDR did not think Hugo Black being in the KKK, was an issue, as long as it was not making a scandal in the papers. He worked for W. Wilson, and deliberatly set up segragation on orders from Wilson, and never rescinded those orders when he was president.",547,12,523,"2,148",1,5

4,Why did Franklin Roosevelt nominate a Klansman to the Supreme Court?,Franklin D. Roosevelt,U.S. Supreme Court,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Several good answers here, but there’s an aspect I haven’t seen addressed that the Smithsonian article mentions. It tells us a lot about how the Deep South in the 1920s and even up into the 1960s was a very different place from here and now, and that’s the reference to the KKK as practically “a fraternal organization”. It really was in that place and time, and that’s a strong indictment of the social organization of the US at that point. The KKK had become a regular feature of life in the South (and other places, but particularly there) to the point that it had effects on the lives of the majority of white people well beyond the openly racist activities. (I omit further mention of its effects on the lives of black people only because that is much better known.) Especially for someone like a lawyer or a salesman, where “contacts” and “networking” is important, it would have been difficult to avoid at the least significant contact with the KKK. Again, let me be very clear that I think this is strong evidence of how broken in a fundamental way our society was at that point, but I recognize it as the reality of the place and time.I’m also not intending to excuse Black’s association with the Klan. I understand it, and I don’t regard him as being as morally culpable as the people who wore sheets at night, burned crosses, and held lynchings. He doesn’t get off scot free, but the issue, if you’ll pardon the turn of phrase, isn’t simply black and white.It’s part of a nuanced picture of a man’s life. Interesting parallels can be drawn to Robert Byrd (whom another answer completely misrepresents), whose case appears very much like Black’s, and George Wallace, whose case is less similar due to his actual virulent racism. Wallace is particularly fascinating because he was not very racist in his early career but after losing an election and (in)famously proclaiming that he wasn’t ever “going to get out-niggered again”, became much more vociferously racist for much of his career. But like Byrd and Black, he changed both in word and action to the point where he got 90% of the black vote in his last run for governor. These are three men whose stories can teach us a lot about both the realities of life in the Southern US before and during the Civil Rights Era and about how people can truly change even on such a divisive and morally charged issue.",441,13,538,"4,372",0,0
4,Why did Franklin Roosevelt nominate a Klansman to the Supreme Court?,Franklin D. Roosevelt,U.S. Supreme Court,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Hugo Black nomination[edit]One of Roosevelt's most severe political defeats during his presidency was the failure of the Judiciary Reorganization Bill of 1937, popularly known as the court-packing bill, which sought to stack a hostile Supreme Court in his favor by adding more associate justices.[1]Soon after this setback, however, Roosevelt obtained his first opportunity to appoint a Supreme Court Justice when conservative Willis Van Devanter retired. Roosevelt wanted the replacement to be a ""thumping, evangelical New Dealer"" who was reasonably young, confirmable by the Senate, and from a region of the country unrepresented on the Court.[2]The three final candidates were Solicitor General Stanley Reed, Indiana Senator Sherman Minton, and Alabama Senator Hugo Black.[3]Roosevelt said Reed ""had no fire,"" and Minton didn't want the appointment at the time.[3]Black was a candidate from the South who as a senator had voted for all twenty-four of Roosevelt's major New Deal programs,[3]and had been an outspoken advocate of the court-packing plan. Roosevelt admired Black's use of the investigative role of the Senate to shape the American mind on reforms, his strong voting record, and his early support, which dated back to 1933.[4]On August 12, 1937, Roosevelt nominated Black to fill the vacancy. For the first time since 1853, the Senate departed from its tradition, which had been to confirm the appointment of a sitting Senator without debate.[5]Instead, it referred the nomination to the Judiciary Committee.[5]Black was criticized by other senators and Newsweek for his presumed bigotry, his cultural roots, and later when it became public, his Klan membership,[6]but the Committee recommended Black's confirmation by a vote of 13–4 on August 16.[7]The next day the full Senate considered Black's nomination.[5]Rumors relating to Black's involvement in the Ku Klux Klan surfaced among the senators,[6]and Democratic Senators Royal S. Copeland and Edward R. Burke urged the Senate to defeat the nomination. However, no conclusive evidence of Black's involvement was available at the time, so after six hours of debate, the Senate voted 63–16 to confirm Black;[8]ten Republicans and six Democrats voted against Black.[6]He resigned from the Senate and was sworn in as an Associate Justice two days later; Black would later explain that the haste in resigning was to avoid fallout from his Klan membership potentially going public.[9] Roosevelt didn’t know of his affiliation with the Klan until “after” he nominated him. I will also point out, he was confirmed by the senate to the Supreme Court.",175,2,44,"1,009",0,24

They do not have sufficient numbers, they do not have enough public recognition, they lack the funding, and they generally don’t have enough media savvy.It doesn’t help that they are often misrepresented by outside interests, or that some of them have a few ideas about government than most people consider very strange—and that their less-strange ideas will often get adopted by the Democratic Party, usually in a watered-down fashion (see: Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid).There’s also the little fact that the current system of voting makes any election a long shot.

It’s appallingly difficult to do this if you aren’t a member of one of the two major parties.The only reason Bernie Sanders was able to win statewide office the first time was due to his very solid tenure as Mayor of Burlington, VT, the largest city in the state.

You may declare Democrat, Republican, any of a number of minor parties depending on where you live, or independent (no party at all). The only way that makes a difference is that it may determine what primary elections you can vote in. In states with “closed primaries”, you can only vote in the primary for the party you chose when you registered. If you registered independent, you cannot vote in primary elections at all. In states with “open primaries”, you may select which party’s primary election you want to vote in on election day, but you may only vote in one. Being registered with a party does not obligate you to vote for that party’s candidates in any election.If you want to become more involved with a party, you may become a member of the party. That typically involves signing up with a state-level organization and declaring that you want to be a member.

They do not operate a full market economy and with their size and resources can absorb tariffs; they do not have a full consumer society that will be upset by the increased cost of tariffs. In the US and the rest of the western world the tariffs will be a drag on the economy, will increase prices to consumers and create inflation.China does nto have an electorate that can complain about any short term dislocation to the economy. The US and the West does and this can cause an uncomfortable time for many elected officials.China’s economy is mainly state run, even private industries operate under the gaze of the Chinese government. It does not really need anything from outside of China. those things it does need it can either do without or can manufacture itself, even if it does not do so at the moment (in particular micro processors and other computer components).One of the reasons for the opium wars was that the Chinese government did nto want anything to trade with Britain, whilst the British wanted tea and other items. The only product the Chinese would take was silver and Britain would rapidly run out of that metal. The Chinese populace did want opium, so despite it being illegal, the British imported this and sold it to the populace. When the Chinese authorities stopped this, or attempted to, this sparked military action by Britain, the opium wars with the intent of opening China up to trade it did not want, but was desperately desired by Britain and other countries (European and the USA).The situation is not much different now. China does not need trade with the USA or the West. It was a clever move by previous presidents to get China into the WTO (watch Trump try to remove the USA from this multi national agreement!) to get it to transform into a market economy. Whilst it is not yet at that stage it is starting to get there. Integrating China into the global economy is one way of trying to prevent future conflict. You need to ask yourself why Trump and his advisors like Bolton are so against multilateral trade agreements. Do they want a return to the 1930s?The tariffs proposed are also stupid. Why add tariffs to products (like steel and aluminium) that become part of your components in your supply chain. It just increases your own prices. If there is a problem with State subsidy the proper action is to impose anti dumping or countervailing duties and raise the issues with the WTO. The objective is to get the state subsidies removed, but that may also backfire on the USA which also provides huge amounts of subsidies to get companies to transfer to the USA. That is one of the reason that VW and Mercedes built plants in the USA, the huge subsidies they received.It would be funny if it was not so serious.",875,23,17,65,0,0

Yet we know Trump knows as much about trade as the Pope knows about marriage.The US has been running a Balance of Payments trade deficit for 40 years.IMO Trump’s purpose to lever trade tariffs is to try and scare US trade partners to entering into a multitude of separate trade deals with sunset clauses.Trump’s administration began this journey by blackmailing South Korea with Tariffs of their steel industry to reopen their free trade agreement KORUS. Being overly dependent on the US, South Korea felt it had little choice but to agree to the blackmail.South Korea agreed to:Cut steel imports to US by 30%10% tariff on aluminiumEstablish a process whereby South Korea cannot deliberately devalue its currencyContinue a 25% tariffs on small truck imports until 2041, that was supposed to expire in 2021Doubles the cap on U.S. truck exports to South Korea for US manufacturersBecause Korea was easy to capitulate, Trump has decided to double down.South Korea is insignificant in the scheme of things, but EU and China are not, so its game on to see if the Trump power play will succeed or not.The benefit from trumps actions will demonstrate how much the US is willing to take a very unpopular stand in 2018 and the resultant impact.P.S. - In the short term Trump wants to appear to his populist supporters to be tough on trade to influence the mid-term elections.It is very conceivable he could do another 180 degree turn in the near future, although I think less likely unless his supporters rise up due to job losses.",320,5,1k,"2,553",0,0

Any economist will tell you that tariffs are a drag on the economy. In theory, targeted tariffs might get China to stop some of their anticompetitive and unfair business practices. However, the Trump tariffs aren’t aimed at those practices, and his tariffs against other countries like Canada and the EUactually hurt that goal. Tariffs against China would be most effective if they were imposed by more countries than just the US. But other countries aren’t going to help rein in China while the US is imposing trade barriers against them.More generally, tariffs are just a bad idea. When free trade hurts some workers in specific industries, the answer isn’t to get rid of free trade. It’s to create policies that help distribute the benefits of free trade to those workers.In very simple terms, free trade makes the pie bigger.

Norman Borlaug can be said, with only a very slight exaggeration, to have saved literally billions of human lives. He is revered in places like India and Mexico, regions that used to be synonymous with famine and starvation. There are countless people alive right now because of Norman Borlaug.He spearheaded what is known as the Green Revolution of the mid-20th century. Dr. Borlaug brought science to agriculture and successfully introduced new techniques in a vast array of agricultural sub-fields, ultimately bringing a high-yielding short-strawed, disease-resistant wheat to farmers around the world. He introduced new techniques of planting and managing crops and through his work in genetics, plant breeding, and soil science developed better pesticides, crops, and spent most of the rest of his life training scientists in agricultural research and production methods.If I were a believer I’d say he should be made a saint.What has America ever done that was so great?

It was the first country to implement the ideals of the Enlightenment on a political level. These included equal opportunity, freedom of speech, the separation of church and state, representative government, etc.According to HW Brands, the US has had the largest population, with the highest standard of living, for the longest period of time, of any country or society in human history. This is due to our capitalist economy and the concept of the “American Dream.”The US played a leading and indispensable role in defeating Germany and Japan in World War II. This helped save the world from totalitarian dominance. The US then constructed what is called the Liberal International Order, which applies our Enlightenment ideals to global politics. Countries were no longer allowed to annex each other, free trade was encouraged, and international organizations like the UN help keep the peace. This has helped produce the freest and most peaceful period in human history.For more of my writing, check out “The Eisenhower Encyclopedia” at www.dwighteisenhower.net",3.8k,41,118,144,0,1

Several points could be raised, but just a few are going to be presented here. First, quite the opposite people say, Natural Resources. USA is plenty of natural resources no matter mineral, agricultural,etc. Second: Americans had the heritage of England where Industrial Revolution Started. Even England and USA are both located in Northern Hemisphere helped a lot. Crossing the North Atlantic from London to NYC is not so hard as coming from Spain to Argentina, or coming from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro, for example.At the beggining, of colonizing, the present USA was not so promissing. Gold and Silver were not so visible( just much more late there were rush golds to California and Alaska, for example), not even coal and oil. Partially because such fuels were not widely still used. That part of North America had a sparce population, different from Aztecs at Mexico and Incas at Peru. So, there´s a tale, that The King of England ordered their ""managers"" to exploit that regions as the Spanish were doing with other parts of America. Try to get all wealth the region has no matter the pain to local people. But as I mentioned, gold and silver were not clearly available, a sparce population did not fit to be enslaved. Bringing Black Slaves for Africa, showed a little cost/benefit( just later Black slavery was introduced in the south of USA). So, British Crown,had to change its mind an start thinking. Let the guys there alone and get just what they could provide. So, such people somehow let alone, as well having the protestant influence to get rid of illiteracy( first for reading The Bible), started colonizing the country, learned to get the resources and in a catalysis process that feeds itself, built a people educated and laborius.The result just could be so good. Because soon there were advantages as:Minerals for fuel as coal( for example we don´t have such vital fuel to start an industrialization at Brazil).Oil( again, our oil in Brazil, the gross is in deep waters, no technology available for centuries)Area for Agriculture.Much more:Soon they had access to two oceans, a vast integrared territory centuries before EU, for example.

We have used that original document for longer than any other country. Why? Because it works.Our democratic society became the envy of the world. European democracies were all more or less based on values and systems they had seen developed in the United States. Some, like the French, failed miserably at first. Most took a very long time to develop a stable, successful government. It took us a handful of years.We established a public schooling system that kept virtually every citizen educated, even those on the frontier during 19th century expansion. For decades, we had the most informed and educated population on earth. Even now, our universities are considered top notch. Why else would people from Japan, Northern Europe, and other places well-known for superior education immigrate here for the chance to learn at American universities?Our free-market capitalist economy has provided for the development and proliferation of some of the world’s most important technologies. Do you enjoy having electric light bulbs? Thank Thomas Edison, an American. Do you like how virtually anyone in a developed society can afford an automobile, instead of only the elite? Thank Henry Ford. How do you like televisions and telephones? Ever use them? Thank American inventors. Then there’s the big boy, the game changer that utterly transformed our world in the course of three short decades: the internet. You can thank the US military for that one.It was our intervention in World War II that won the cause for the Allies. We liberated France on D-Day, costing us thousands of young lives. The organizer of the invasion, of course, was American Dwight D. Eisenhower. This marked the turning point in the war, and the Third Reich fell soon after. Our participation was key in preventing Nazi fascism from consuming the entirety of Europe. You’re welcome, Europe.We rid the Pacific of the Japanese Empire. Innumerable atrocities were committed on both sides, including the tragic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but Japanese who lived during the war thank Americans today for freeing them from the oppressive militarism of their erstwhile empire.After the war, America invested huge sums of money in rebuilding their defeated enemies. This was a tremendous act of generosity and savvy, gaining us strong allies and establishing stability in the regions once ravaged by war.Do you like that there are free Koreans not subject to Kim Jong Un’s regime? Thank the fifty thousand soldiers who died on Korean soil to make it happen. For that matter, America is largely responsible for the spread of democracy to once oppressed nations throughout the 20th century, whether to formerly fascist or communist countries. Our stand against Russia prevented millions from being trapped in the abject poverty of North Korea, Venezuela, and Soviet Russia.We fought for years against terrorism in Iraq and Afghanistan. We contributed to the defeat of the horrifying ISIS regime. We work to keep Russia, an international bully, out of Middle Eastern countries. We still work to promote freedom everywhere.It’s true, we have made a lot of mistakes. We have intruded in places where I think we ought not to have intruded, and a lot of people throughout the world view us as arrogant and self-serving.

The first was Hillary Clinton to give a concession speech, and the second was for a conservative to be appointed to the Supreme Court. Since both of those occurred early on, much more has been gravy.For example, I absolutely love watching Nancy Pelosi sputter like a fish out of water when she talks about “the disasters!, the crumbs!, the pile of doggie doo with a cherry!, and the children!”. I chuckle when I watch Chuck Schumer denigrate a Trump proposal knowing that he and his minions were licking Obama’s boots whenever he proposed anything similar. I love watching the hypocrisy of that Party when Trump offers more than what they ask for (DACA) but refuse to budge on his other pillars and that their party platform consists of identity politics and obstruction. I enjoy watching Californication making their state as horrible as they can make it in an attempt to bring in a few trainloads of voters that will buy their sorry program.I’m hopeful that companies that are tired of the elitism of some of those states will move to areas that welcome them and that won’t tax them to death.I understand his desire to tweet in order to negate the Fakestream Media, so even though he blows it occasionally, he has been known to step back and fix things rather than doubling down.I can’t keep track of all the Obama Executive Orders that he’s cancelled. I kind of wish he’d wiped them all out on day 1 or 2 but there’s still time. I still remember “W” sitting down and cancelling Clinton’s EO on Labor/Management Partnerships about a half hour after his inauguration in 2001 and was tickled pink.

6,What do you as a Republican who voted for Donald Trump think of him now?,Republican Party (US politics),Trump-Pence 2016,1!,1!,1!,1!,"I feel even better, and more impressed with Donald Trump, than I did when I voted for him in the Primaries and then again in the 2016 General Election.Why? Simple: Unlike the RINOs who have campaigned for our votes and money (Bush 41—”Read my lips! No new taxes!” and “Pro-Second Amendment!” — most embarrassingly conspicuous among them, along with many, even most, others), Donald Trump has worked strenuously to keep all of his campaign promises, and hasn’t stabbed us in the back by breaking a single one of them, despite the tremendous pressure Democrats, the media, and the RINOs have exerted on him.And I agree with all of his positions, on all of the important issues he’s addressed.He hasn’t yet been allowed — by the Dems and the NeverTrump RINOs, who both hate him equally, and are equally determined to block whatever he does — to fulfill all of his promises; Building The Wall is just one good example. But he’s managed to fulfill some of the important ones, and continues to fight for the rest, with no apologies.We’re sick of hearing Trump — and ourselves — slandered almost daily as everything from “dumb,” to “racist,” to “unfit,” to “Hitler,” and everything else that they throw at us, hoping that at least something will stick. They routinely call for him to be “impeached,” and even, sometimes, to be assassinated.Neither he, nor we, are any of those. But in the absence of any serious, coherent, fact-based arguments against his positions and policies, reckless name-calling is all they have, not facts or objective analysis of achieved results.The more the partisan Left and the RINOs revile him and condemn every move he makes or refuses to make — they first slammed him for offering to sit down with the Nork dictator to negotiate the complete, verifiable nuclear disarmament of the the North, then slammed him for canceling the meeting, then slammed him again when the meeting was once again on, and happened — the more convinced I am that I cast my ballot for him correctly, and will again 2020.Yes, President Trump is a tough, straight-talking New York S.O.B. with sharp elbows and an even sharper tongue — to the feigned “shock” of the corrupt, entrenched “Establishment” in both Parties.But that’s one of his qualities that I value most in him: He says, right away (or Tweets) what he thinks, without the filter of the media, or running it past any timid “advisers” or focus groups, and means what he says. Then he goes ahead and does it. What you see is what you get. What’s not to like about that, especially in a President?It’s about time — and probably our last chance — to have a man like that in the White House.Disagree with his positions and policies, if you want to.

With the love of autocracy of those who have been in a position to give orders to underlings all his life.But his executive orders, withdrawal from treaties, and administrative appointments have been doing the bidding of the wealthy capitalist elite, his real “constituency” as Chomsky put it. This is what Steve Bannon has called “the deconstruction of the administrative state.” But that’s disingenuous. Trump is happy to give an even more extreme level of utter impunity to local police and ICE agents — as with Sessions ending investigations of civil rights violations by police. So the steel fist of the state is fine with them.So this has involved attacks on public education (such as attacking requirement of provisions for disabled students), attacks on affordable housing subsidies, cuts to food stamps, withdrawal from the climate change treaty, attacks on even the ability of EPA to collect data on global warming, removal of regulations on fracking, on chemical exposures of workers (as with asbestos), cuts to Medicaid.The people who benefit from these kinds actions are the carbon cartel & petro-chemical industry (the people Pruitt shills for), and the corporate elite in general. The rich are also the people who benefit from the tax cut. The point to these tax cuts, since Reagan, is to undermine the ability of the state to fund social benefits. So with cuts to federal revenue, the idea is that down the road there will be pressure to cut things like Medicare and Social Security.Since the “southern strategy” of the ’70s and the absorption of the racist Dixiecrats the politics of “white identity” appeals to white racial resentment is part of the extreme Social Darwinist policy of the Republicans. In other words, the appeal is to attack any policy that might benefit the racial “Other” in the eyes of this base.A vicious Social Darwinist politics is an attack on the majority of the population, even if vulnerable minorities here and there are targeted.

Although often asked to explain what “misspoke” meant when he said it, Speakes was careful to never answer that question, to always leave the ambiguity.And that was an important part of what made Reagan the “teflon president”. Never clarify such points, leave them to interpretation but always with at least one reasonable interpretation presented by his supporters so it wouldn’t break the “good grandfather looking out for our best interests” myth. Reagan’s grandfatherly manner and gracious presence made his regular untruths palatable to those who agreed with him in principle. His supporters were willing to forgive his regular misstatements because he gave them a higher “truth” they found plausible.And so it is with Trump. Different persona but operating under the same kind of mantle of forgiveness. Trump isn’t the grandfatherly voice speaking wisdom, Trump is the blunt, canny, no bullshit businessman with the patriotism and business insights to put aside the confounding and contentious political blather and do what America needs to be “great” once more. Just as Reagan did, Trump regularly gets a pass for his nonsense because of his persona. In fact, Trump is well on his way toward seizing the “teflon president” mantle from his predecessorPersonas are all well and good but what both personas mask and masked is critically important: neither president had much knowledge of what was actually going on in their administrations beyond broad strokes. Each of them appointed people to responsible positions where they could undermine all efforts of the government to help people. All of their respective appointees were in essence invisible gremlins chipping away at the things that truly made America great under the cover of their president saying he wanted to “restore” America’s former power and glory.So in this sense, Chomsky is entirely correct. Well, except perhaps for the “completely” part. Trump is not a detail person, quite the opposite. And he constantly gets distracted by his own ego. Moreover, while his minions may have Chomsky’s fear as their goal, I don’t think they are thorough-going enough to destroy everything of benefit. As a rule I am not sure they are smart enough or have sufficient vision to destroy everything.Plus, there is institutional push-back and even occasionally some elected Republicans in the legislature who are of sufficient conscience to risk the wrath of Trump’s base by resisting some of the more draconian cutbacks and changes proposed by Trump’s appointees.Now, as for Trump’s role as a distraction, yes, his ability to take command of the news cycle with his outrageousness is important to avoid public debate on many constant individual chippings away of benefits Americans now enjoy. Ultimately, if Trump is successful, the very rich and corporations will have protected rights and privileges, the rest of us not so much.Chomsky has correctly identified Trump’s role in diminishing the benefits of American citizenship but perhaps overstates Trump’s competence and the competence of his gremlins and even of some occasional push-back from Republican elected representatives who suddenly discover their backbones or from American majorities who come to recognize particular excesses of Trump’s minions, both of which we have already seen.The implication many would recognize from Chomsky’s statement is that there is some author, whether Trump himself or a cabal of wealthy Americans or some other stealthy person or group making a conscious effort to affect this change. But such inference is unfounded. I doubt Trump could conceive of such a plan and act on it, I doubt he could stay on such a plan if it were authored by other actors. I think the greatest part of what Chomsky said is true but I doubt it is the result of some nefarious scheme or will result in Americans losing all benefits of their government. I think most of what Trump is attempting to do is a result of misguided personal interests and venality. That said, my opinion is hardly dispositive of the issue.Trump is this generation’s Reagan, a meaner Reagan for a meaner world. Reagan’s eight year tenure as president, his lack of attention to detail, and his misunderstandings and wrong-headed beliefs resulted in the appointment of more officials who ended up being prosecuted and going to prison for misconduct in office than any administration before or since. I wouldn’t be surprised if Trump, with those same failings, is able to surpass that record in a mere four years.Trump’s “vision” and unspoken goal seems to be to make America the largest banana republic in the world by destroying the differences between the America generations of Americans have built and actual banana republics, all of which is what he seems to think is synonymous with greatness.As Trump himself is wont to say, sad!",258,19,18,45,0,0

We’ve enjoyed decades of being able to set the economic, foreign policy and social agenda for the world. We’ve build the world economic order in our image. We sell our goods abroad and purchase according to rules that the USA has had the largest role in establishing. Our enemies are oceans away from us, and neither of the countries that border the USA are strong militarily, or pose any threat to us.Now, this might be a hard concept for a Trump Republican to get one’s mind around, but the USA can actually afford to be nice. The USA can afford to help people, and the old GOP understood that. Despite the constant right-wing media teaching that the USA is getting kicked around by the rest of the world, in reality. We are not. America has had it very good, and the pre-Trump, pre-Tea Party GOP recognized that. . And believe it or not, we are not threatened by thousands of refugees from some of the poorest nations of the world needing to flee their murderous regimes. When we open our doors to such people, our own lives become better. Members of the pre-Trump, pre-Tea Party GOP recognized that reality.Until the rise of Donald Trump, America has always been quite proud to be a positive force in the world, to share, to show our best sides, and as a result, you can go onto Amazon and buy anything you want from any corner of the globe at a reasonable price. As a result, the people who come here from other countries enjoy being here, look up to America, and don’t wanna blow us up. That’s a good thing, because unless we want to create a police state here in the USA, anyone could blow us up if they wanted to. So, it’s a good thing that no one does. That’s because the world always looked up to us.Donald Trump is changing all that. He’s serving notice that the USA now intends to be every bit as selfish and pigheaded as the world’s worst Third and Fourth-rate dictatorships, preferring the company of Kim Jong-un to civilized democracies . . . meaning. .. countries that don’t feed political opponents to crocodiles, like Kim Jong-un does.

I hope so. I want GOP to become a party my Democrats failed to become or, if not that, to be more close to FDR created ideals.The State Capitalism first implemented by Mussolini in Italy and Roosevelt in USA proved to be the most viable politico-economical system that saved Capitalism from inevitable decay. Once adopted by the West it allowed to prevail in Cold War and to turn Russia into State Capitalist country as well.I hated GOP as many years as GOP hated State Capitalism, i.e. as far as I remember. Their Anarchism, their desire to rid of State or make it insignificant that was based on utopian views of Ayn Rand and other Libertarians was the reason for regress they were subjecting the country every time they came to power. Their desire to destroy the American Middle Class via reversal in wealth re-distribution has always been deplorable. Trump is chasing the Libertarians out. Good riddance. Some odd figures like VP and Senate Majority Leader may stick around, but most will follow House Speaker.So beliefs are changing slowly, yet surely. My only concern is a possible reversal. That is why Trump has to get re-elected.Politics remains the same. Politics has never had much to do with beliefs. It is about candidate personality, appearance and local popularity. A few failures were there. That allowed Trump haters in both parties get the false impression that Trump movement is short in life expectancy. The truth, however, was the losses of Trump supporters were because of their personal problems, not an ideological defeats, although, as I said politics is not about beliefs. The midterm elections will render a true verdict on the matter.Views? Most Republicans are Conservatives. They, therefore, quite sure their views are unchanging. It is not true, views are changing with changing of beliefs, although even slower. Yet, the views do not matter as long as they vote Republican i.e. Trump. Democrats are currently doing everything to get Trump re-elected and his non-ideological ideology to succeed.

2,Why are the Republicans not able to repeal Obamacare even if they are the majority?,Obamacare / Affordable Care Act,Health Insurance,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Republicans continue to aggressively sabotage Obamacare, but outright legislative repeal is rare — and difficult. Historically, it usually happens long after a law has become unnecessary or defunct entirely on it’s own.In fact, our whole legislative system is designed to make repeal very difficult — and lengthy — which is also why it’s more common and easier to repeal truly antiquated and outdated laws.The system creates incentives to expand the regulatory state, but not to contract it. Rent-seekers and political entrepreneurs are constantly seeking new ways to use the power of government for private gain, and every crisis (real or perceived) creates an opportunity for a new rule or new program. Once in place, programs can rarely be challenged successfully because entrenched interests, including agencies and congressional committees, have the home-turf advantage in defending them.Susan E. Dudley — Director of the GW Regulatory Studies Center and a Research Professor at the Trachtenberg School of Public Policy and Public Administration of The George Washington UniversityThe more the Republicans sabotage Obamacare, the more they will claim they “repealed” it — and in some ways — they are correct. If you sabotage enough component pieces of a law — the effect can be equivalent to repeal.But sabotaging — or even repealing Obamacare won’t change the trajectory of this chart. We have a full-blown healthcare cost crisis and Obamacare didn’t solve it. Neither will Trumpcare (in any current or future form).NB: The chart only goes to 2014.

2,Why are the Republicans not able to repeal Obamacare even if they are the majority?,Obamacare / Affordable Care Act,Health Insurance,1!,1!,1!,1!,"They did repel it.

Health Insurance Marketplace, the federal marketplace that serves 39 states, was just about 400,000 fewer than the number that signed up during the prior enrollment season in 2016. It’s struggling to enroll 9 million people, when it’s original goal was over 20 million.First, after the initial surge, Obamacare’s enrollment numbers have mostly disappointed. Not in a catastrophic way — the law has knocked down the U.S. uninsured rate to about 11-12 percent, compared to a pre-Great Recession level of 14-15 percent. But depending on how you cut the numbers, it looks like the Obamacare exchanges will fall at least four million enrollees short of the target for 2016.In 2007, when Obamacare was enacted, there were 46 million uninsured. Today, the number is close to 39 million, so we’ve made a 8 million dent on uninsured— almost all of which is explained by Medicaid expansion.Secondly, the people who are enrolling are sicker and more heavily-subsidized than either the White House or the participating insurers had hoped; the healthy uninsured are often choosing to pay the fine (sorry, Chief Justice Roberts, I mean tax) and go without coverage. Which means the initially lower-than-expected premiums charged on the exchanges are headed upward, and major insurers may end up following United Healthcare for the exits if the numbers don’t improve.If this is success of a Democratic plan, it’s not looking like it.

1,"If you are a Republican, define a liberal.",Liberalism (politics),Republican Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"Original Question: If you are a Republican, define a liberal.No Original Question DetailsThank you for the A2A, Ryan SutherlandI am not a Republican, nor am I a Democrat. I am a classical liberal, not a modern one.To add a little context to that, I have not happily voted for any President in my lifetime. And though it is hindsight, the only Republican President for whom I would have been honored to have voted for would have been Abraham Lincoln. As far as Democrats go, I would have voted for FDR in 1940, but not in 1932 or 1936. FDR was the right guy for a global war. But the New Deal FDR was a hopeless incompetent.In fairness, Lincoln probably would have been a very poor peacetime President as well.But that does not define a liberal, classical or otherwise.Classical liberals are people who believe in the premise that opens and animates the Declaration of Independence and indeed that of the American Republic: the idea that all persons are legally equal and that they are endowed with certain inalienable rights, and that these are life, liberty, the produce of one’s own labor, and fair access to the resources of this Earth¹.Defining a modern liberal is much, much, much more tricky.Conservatives try to define modern liberals, and they get it wrong. And I believe when they do, they do modern liberals a favor—or they are playing the game that modern liberals want them to play—conservatives try to personally abuse and shame modern liberals, but instead of having the desired effect, it gives the modern liberal an opportunity to play the victim card. (As a side note, conservatives have learned how to use that tactic all too well themselves.)I guess the only way I can explain a modern liberal, without reducing it to soundbites that will get it wrong, is to bring in my professional experience over the past 30 years.I work in the alcohol and drug addiction treatment field, now as a consultant, formerly as administrative staff for a number of treatment providers.While there are certainly other treatment modalities, the focus of most treatment programs is to get addicts and alcoholics into a 12-step program.Over the course of my professional career, I have had a number of opportunities to interact with members of the General Service Board of Alcoholics Anonymous based out of New York City.What I learned from interacting with them is that the model pushed in most treatment programs is not exactly the same ideas contained in the original experience of early AA members.Without getting into too many details, the two biggest things that I learned from the AA GSB is that AA does not and never has promoted itself as a solution for all problems. AA is very explicit about that. They promise that if an alcoholic practices the 12 steps, and abides by their 12 traditions, that alcoholic is very, very, very likely to get and remain sober.That is it. Recovery from alcoholism. AA promises nothing else.Whatever one thinks of their approach, it is very disciplined and focused.When I get out into the real world of “recovery,” however, I find a religion springing up around the 12 steps, and concomitantly, very little interest in or even outright hostility to AA’s “Twelve Traditions.”The reason for this is simple. The Twelve Steps are older, were written when nobody had more than a few years of sobriety, and are ripe for abuse and manipulation.The “Twelve Traditions” on the other hand, came a number of years later and cannot as easily be used as weapons against others and work completely against the idea of self-promotion.What narcissist cares for that?There is a saying in the world of recovery, “What do you get when you sober up a drunken horse thief? You get a sober horse thief.”The rampant narcissism that complicated the lives of these dry alcoholics and non-using addicts does not go away simply because they have stopped using and drinking.So why have I brought this up?Because in all my travels I have spoken with thousands of alcoholics and drug addicts, and while on the surface they may seem very much the same, deep down they are light years apart.Deep down, the alcoholic does not understand why he cannot have a few drinks and be satisfied. The alcoholic wants to be normal. Many alcoholics, when they are sober, are very productive and likeable people. What really gets the alcoholic is that he can’t have a few drinks, and go home like everyone else does. Once he has a drink, he cannot stop. And the only remedy is total abstinence.The addict is entirely different. The addict is looking for a utopia that he or she cannot have in this lifetime. And so many addicts will deliberately overdose hoping to reach this Earthly nirvana—and if they die? So what?But it is a tease. The high is only a tease of anything like real happiness, only the addict cannot see this.So why do I mention this?Because that, I think is what the modern liberal is—the addict. They have this vague, fuzzy notion that they can perfect society, and a compulsion to try. And gradually, because no reform ever really works, they stray further and further and further from the intent of what it was they hoped to accomplish.Modern liberals cannot tolerate the moderate progress of classical liberalism because it does not contain the “high” of “fixing” society or the world.And what is worse, is that by being this way, they open the door to the very abuses they had hoped to overcome in the first place. Even when modern liberals don’t completely go off the ranch and propose policies so stupid that classical liberals have to side with conservatives to stop them, they fail to support the classically liberal pillars of our society.What they fail to realize is that there really are only two choices: classical liberalism or feudalism.Allegedly, Hitler was far right and Stalin was far left. I have come to realize that both of these claims are dime-journalist nonsense.Both Hitler and Stalin were feudalists. And their intent was to return Europe to feudalism, albeit it with the Hitler and Stalin dynasties, not the Hohenzollerns and the Romanovs.See, here is the thing. As awful as monarchy is, a traditional monarchy is superior to a brutal, modern monarchy. Anyone with the slightest bit of sense would see that to be true.Even if you are Hitler or Stalin—they both wound up prematurely dead.So TL; DRA classical liberal is someone who believes in the legal equality of all persons, that they are endowed with unalienable rights, including (but not limited to), life, liberty, the produce of one’s own labor, and fair access to the resources of the Earth.A modern liberal is someone who believes in the perfectibility of society, but can offer no guide to what that perfection is, other than what “feels good” or “feels right.”¹ I realize the DOI says, “pursuit of happiness” and that the Constitution replaces “pursuit of happiness” with property. And I have little doubt that there are Feudal conservatives who object to the idea that everyone should have fair access to the resources of the Earth—hell, there are some conservatives out there who do not believe that everyone is entitled to the produce of their own labor.",65,0,542,"1,680",0,0

They talk like a conservative and vote in the Congress like liberals. So the two parties now, in my opinion, are Establishment Party vs. Trump Party.The Trump Party is more truly conservative and want limited federal Government with power distributed back to the States, Traditional immigration laws, free market private enterprise with control of monopolies, free and fair trade, strong military with less intervention and intensive government reform, to name a few things. Lastly, I think the New World Order is running the Establishment Policies for their benefit and for the detriment of America and the World. A vote for an Establishment Politician, Republican or Democrat, is in reality a vote for the New World Order. Trump and his fledging party, to my mind, is the only way to go.Today’s definition of a Liberal is far different from its Historical roots. It has been highly radicalized like so many other things in recent years. To me a Liberal is someone who doesn’t believe in God’s rule, and therefore embraces man’s ruling Philosophy/Religion of Secular Humanism. The Liberal believes he can create a Utopian Society, if given a big enough Government, with enough power. The focus is on the optimization of group welfare as opposed to the focus on individual liberty in Conservative Philosophy. One side is based on God and the other side is based on man.

If yes, why?I have never been a leftist. Nor have I been a Democrat. I have never voted Democratic for a candidate to serve in the House of Representatives. Had I been alive and eligible to vote in 1960, I would have voted third party, as I would have considered both Kennedy and Nixon to be dangerous demagogues. In 1952 and 1956 I probably would have voted third party in protest of Ike choosing Dick Nixon as his running mate.In 2000, I voted for John McCain in the Wisconsin Presidential Primary. I would have voted for McCain in the general election over Al Gore in a heartbeat.The Republicans began losing me with Nixon, and really started downhill with Reagan. I thought Bush ’41 would be an improvement, but he turned out to be just another Neocon.The current Republican party has nearly finished the purge of its old guard.

There are some very good people in the party. What gets to me is how many of them can not see the good in the opposite party. I am so tired of my friends from the GOP demonizing anyone who thinks differently. They are constantly telling others to get out of America and denouncing them as unAmerican. Do they not understand how if they kicked everyone out that disagreed with them that they themselves would end up being kicked out for not being American enough to someone else? The GOP has become so racist and bigoted (not by everyone). It is the silence that tells the truth. Those who are not racist and bigoted are agreeing when they do not speak out. They may feel that they are only being silent and not rocking the boat. However it is seen all across the world and across all of time that people who are silent are actually agreeing because it is their silence that lets such hate stand.That is how I feel about the Republican party. Those who are silent and do not criticize their party when they step out of line are allowing crimes to be done in their name and they are responsible. I have seen more leaders of the GOP take a hit and be called names by their party but I have seen very, very, few members who have taken a stand.

Yes, that sounds absurdly dramatic, but if we accept the scientific consensus of anthropologic climate change and the cataclysmic consequences it portends, the stalwart Republican denial of it could literally be the most dangerous political idea ever propagated.For those unwilling or unable to comprehend the above, there’s still nothing extant in meaningful quantities in the current party that is worth supporting. A healthy debate about how to achieve our shared goals would be welcome, but at present, there’s scarcely any agreement about what our goals are as a country.At best, Republican supporters are insular and entitled Scrooges whose only concern is selfishly “lowering their taxes” at the expense of others (usually the poor). At worst, they are condemning innocent people to third-world maternal mortality rates[1], pushing for despotic rates of incarceration[2] unequaled by any country, viciously holding onto the most expensive per-capita health care system in the world[3], prioritizing profits over people (and their jobs, education, health etc.), regularly assaulting the freedom of the press, keeping good on a decades-long strategy to purge voter roles, obstruct access to polling stations, or gerrymander their way to finally killing off real democracy in this country. Top that off with absurd anti-intellectual and “fake-news” jingoism espoused by their chest-thumping supporters who are hell bent on exercising their “freedom” to discriminate, and we got ourselves a predicament.

They rightly recognise how dangerous he is - it’s not for nothing that there’s been a significant uptick in the number of Republicans in the House and Senate who have decided to resign/retire this year.The issue for many Republican representatives is that the Republican Base largely stands behind Trump. Some do because they genuinely think he’s a good President, some do because he supports policies that benefit them, and others do simply because they like that he thumbs his nose against Liberals/Democrats (and can therefore only be a good thing, with the US as polarised as it is).Anyway, as a result of this, there are a good number of principled, experienced, capable Republican politicians who know fully well that they are stuck between a rock and a hard place: if they support Trump, they throw in their lot with everything he stands for, and if they oppose Trump, they’ve got hardly any chance of being re-elected when they stand for the Midterms, because the base stands behind Trump, and therefore support those who support him.You need only look at John McCain, Jeff Flake, Lindsay Graham, Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, Bob Corker, Dean Heller, Susan Collins, and many more - Republicans who have either opposed Trump, or have made it clear that they’re uncomfortable with his actions and ‘leadership’. To me, it does prove that there are many Republicans who do not stand by Trump, and understand the threat he poses.Unfortunately, they still have to be elected, and that requires that they pander to the base if they want to retain their office in the future.

Does the USA need a new conservative party?,Political Conservatism,Republican Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"If Donald Trump is the preferred representative of 35–40% of the U.S. Electorate, then a new conservative party is only one of many things needed. The first that comes to mind is a better class of voter. If this two-bit carnival barker is anyone’s idea of an appropriate person to represent a huge, diverse nation with the largest, most diverse economy in the world, then that person needs to turn off Fox News and daytime television and go back to school and learn something about civics and the history of this country.And that leads me to another urgent current need: better schooling. We need to produce a much better informed body politic. We need much better instruction in history, civics, economics, and ethics.And we need those institutions traditionally responsible for producing responsible citizens: family, school, church, neighborhoods, to step up and do a better job. The current despicable level of demagoguery that is turning Americans against each other can only succeed if the institutions just mentioned neglect to champion a respect for the truth as well as a spirit of humility concerning the difficulty of establishing truth and a decent openness to truths that may challenge long-held myths and errors.Resentment and hatred can be rejected and combated, or they can be cynically stoked and exploited. Mr. Trump and his ignorant and malign acolytes proudly do the latter and typically suffer no significant opprobrium for the outrage.Those Americans who still know right from wrong must call bullshit on this sordid array of post-truth trolls and vote them back into the fetid intellectual backwaters from which they have so tragically emerged.",160,2,160,759,0,0

With all the corruption and fraud coming to light since Trump was in office, how can WE THE PEOPLE trust any of these scumbags in DC anymore. I for one am fed up with politicians, and since they will never vote for term limits, I would never vote for another career politician, they all suck in both parties.With the divide in both parties worse than in any time in history, this is the perfect time to revolt and no matter which party you are aligned with, ask yourself this, WHY? I have been independent for decades, voted for Perot as example which had a chance to disrupt two party system, but both sides attacked him and forced him out, and that is why I am an independent, they talk common sense as Perot did with his chalk board, brilliant strategy to show American voters in black and white what was wrong with government and all the waste of taxpayers money.Finally the truth is coming out for all to see unless you are deaf, dumb and blind moron who I call the pathological deniers, unable to accept the truth and facts no matter what when it is against their party. Why are democrats so loyal to their party when it is so corrupt to have orchestrated conspiracy against Trump by DNC and Clinton Cartel paying $12.6 million to fix elections by setting Trump up with this whole Fusion GPS Russian collusion illusion. So if ever in history WE THE PEOPLE have a real voice in politics, this is the time as I see it as an independent. The system is fixed against independents, I can’t even participate in primaries as example.In a perfect world, which this is not, a true independent party is needed to break down the old two party fixed system. With Trumps success and achievements to date in only his first 500 days, more than Obama accomplished in 8 years, people have to start to wake up to reality, Trump won because he was not a politician first and foremost, and if we look back in history, politicians have not accomplished much to help WE THE PEOPLE. So with this said, and the fact Trump will win in 2020, hands down, and where he had been in the middle himself for decades, once registered as a democrat to help cut through the corrupt dominated democrat controlled NYC dirty politics, he has seen both sides. Now as a republican president, he has exposed the corrupt resistance factor of republican party, clear for all to see with the likes of McCain who is traitor for his part in conspiracy which will come out soon, so good riddance to this phony hero, he is a zero who has reached the end of his stint in congress, thank God. Why do you think so many in congress are not running again, they are running from their corruption being exposed over the many years in congress, you watch how many are exposed under Trumps terms, should be fun to watch how many are caught up in cover ups. These people will do anything to protect their good old boys club. lolSo if Trump really wants to Make America Great again, then he should run as an independent next election. Dump the GOP along with all the resistance haters who are against him even with all his accomplishments to date, imagine when he accomplishes even more, like seeing deficit reduced and a balanced budget which is one of his goals. Along with denuclearizing Iran next, he would be unstoppable and truly define a true independent party where the moderate democrats could embrace given minority unemployment is lowest in history, salaries have risen first time in decades of stagnation, more jobs than there are those on welfare, so all this will add up to a balanced budget for first time in decades. Kennedy democrats would finally cross party lines, republican elites would be derailed and cross over as well, now this would be a dream come true for us independents if Trump initiated a new party platform. The WE THE PEOPLE PARTY, has a nice ring to it. Or how about the KEEP AMERICA GREAT PARTY? Simply put, WAKE UP AMERICA, the time is now to cross your old party lines and vote for the person, not the party which is an old fixed and corrupted system, sad to say, but true, our founders never calculated there would be career politicians, who would have thought. lol",101,0,60,994,0,0

An immigration supporter may focus on the story of an undocumented immigrant who is now a doctor.

If one person uses a particular fact to support her argument, her opponent may use an alternative fact to support an opposing argument.This is normal political discussion. Where it gets to be a problem is when people use incorrect or made-up information to support their arguments. For example, when people claim that Trump is literally working for Putin. Or when folks claim that Clinton was involved in a sex-trafficking ring.The difference I see is that very, very few people actually believed any of the fake news about Clinton.

The Democrat party was strong in the South fron the start of US political parties, the exception being the Appalacian Mountains and hillbillies were never strong Democrats, as compared to the rednecks in the Deltas.That can be seen even today here in Georgia. The moderate Republicans in GA think like Southern Democrats of the 50s and 60s. The Ted Cruz/Rand Paul type Republicans think like abolitionists. And this diffrerence in native Georgians has a correlation to how long they have been Republican.The question is also wrong at the other end of time. Goldwater got more votes than Ike from Southern whites. But in 1968 the 2 Democrats on the ballot carried the South overwhelmingly. Looking at the 1972 election helps understand the 1968 election.Nixon did well in the South in 1972. But look at the map. Nixon did well everywhere. That is because the entire country was pro-Vietnam war and even more so anti-war protestor and anti-communist.Take a look at the Democrat KKK and Democrat White Citizens Council in the 60s and 70s. When they used racist language their support existed but was weak. When they used anti-Comnunist language their support was much, much broader and deeper.When far right talkshow host Billy James Hargis if Little Rock hinted at racism his audience in both the South and North declined. But when he went anti-Comnunist his audience increased, especially in the South.Of course, a few civil rights workers fed right into the trap. In the 60s many civil rights workers were Edward Brooks Republicans. But a small, noisy subset of civil rights workers were YPSL/YSA types who openly advocated Communism. This gave the Democrat KKK/White Citizens Council ammunition with which to tie the two issues together.Of course, Jimny Carter was elected president because he did well in the South.The South went more Republican in 1980 because Reagan ran on defeating Communism, not just coexistence and MAD, like both R and D before him. It should be noted that Reagan was the first Republican ever to get a majority of the white Evangelucal/Fundamentalist vote. And this is largely because he was the first to broaden that vote in the South from the Appalachian hillbillies to the river bottom rednecks.But the question is about party and not candidate. The Republican party did not become the majority party in the South until the 1990s. In many parts of the South not until very recently. One white Congressional District in GA didn’t become Republican until 2016.So the South did not switch to Republican over LBJ. It has been a 55 year process. Democrats soft on Communism who appear anti-American has been by far the biggest factor in that shift, especially in the 60s and 70s.Pro-life has been the second biggest factor. But it did not become a factor until ChristianCoalition/ MoralMajority/Ralph Reed (GOP state chair in GA) started to figure it out around 1988.Race has been an issue with some Democrats. It is not a top tier issue wrh Republucans, certainly not with Southern Republicans.It should be noted that Nixon ran on Democrats soft on crime. This was aimed directly at turning the Northern Vito Marzullo/Lipinski Democrats into Republicans and associating the Days of Rage and anti-war protests with the Demcrats.Ps. When I hitch hiked through the South in the 60s attending SNCC, CORE, KKK, White Citizens Council and similar events and sleeping in their houses, I billed myself as a student of sociology.

It is important to note that, despite Nixon and many of those around him being racist, this was largely a means to an end. By harnessing these forces, they could gain political power. After Nixon’s success, Reagan followed suit as did other Republicans (as the great Mark Shields likes to say, “politics is the most imitative of human endeavors”).The Gingrich Effect:Newt Gingrich is perhaps the key to the actual shift. If Nixon was the Baptist, Newt is Jesus. Gingrich pushed a strategy where no political norm was worth respecting if it stood in the way of power. By destroying norm after norm, he hollowed out institutions and undermined the Republican party’s commitment to small “r” republicanism.The Mitch Effect:Mitch McConnell took Gingrich’s gospel one step further when he declared that the GOP should oppose any action by a sitting US president, thus felling the last great prop of our republic, the commitment to actually do the work of government. In so doing he further undermined the very idea of government, and continued to press a whole series of lies in order to try and gain and hold power.The Trump Coup de grace.It is a mistake to think Trump the disease.

Now here is the real irony: with few exceptions, Trump has continued to push exactly the policies that the elites love (notice that praising Nazis as “good people” and tearing children from families was fine with the GOP elite, but tariffs was just too much to take).And PRESTO!

2,What do you think about Donald Trump being right to demand a sunset clause in NAFTA?,North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Being right? He wasn’t - not at all.Bear in mind, that concept of a long-term trade agreement is one that allows companies to invest in the future, and that’s not something that’s limited to just a few short years. If a company or a corporation invest, they’re looking to develop business that could potentially last decades.The sunset clause effectively meant that the NAFTA provisions would expire within five years, and therefore have to be renegotiated. While that sounds fine, what happens if it isn’t effectively renegotiated five years down the line? What if provisions that apply today are withdrawn? What happens if companies have invested millions or billions, and then see that money go to waste as new tariffs come into place, or quotas are created that prevent them from trading?The whole point of Trump and Pence pushing the sunset clause was to kill the new trade deal. Canada had already rejected the idea that such a clause should be put into place during the many months of negotiation - it was a non-starter for the Canadians, because it would damage any chance of encouraging positive investment on either side of the border. US companies would be reluctant to invest in Canada, and Canadian companies would feel the same. Put bluntly: with a sunset clause, NAFTA wasn’t going to happen.This has been done for one reason, and one reason only: so Trump can appear ‘strong’ at the negotiating table. He can walk away and say “Look, we tried to negotiate with the Canadians, but they didn’t really want to deal”. He can continue to attack the Canadians and suggest that they engage in unfair trade practices, purely because they killed a deal in progress - he can project a false narrative of “The big bad Canadians wanted everything, but weren’t willing to deal”. The exact same nonsense that Trump spouted at the G7 summit.The sad reality is that Trump had no intention of creating a new trade deal, and certainly no intention of continuing NAFTA, even under new terms. He wants to have his cake and eat it: he inherently presumes that the Canadians will come crawling to the White House on bended knee for a trade deal, if he keeps being stubborn. They’ll be desperate, and he can choose terms that are favourable to him, and screw over Canada.The problem? The absence of an effective trade deal between the US and Canada is far more damaging to the United States. After all, who do you think is the primary importer of US goods? Let’s look at it by state, shall we?It’s not gonna be Canada who get screwed over here: if trade tightens up at the border, it’ll be US citizens who suffer, because the manufacturing industries will have lost their biggest customer.Trump and Pence are screwing around with the livelihoods of millions of Americans in the vain hope that Trudeau will crawl to the negotiating table and beg for scraps. He won’t: the Canadians are in a strong bargaining position, and have positive trade relations around the world. They’d undoubtedly suffer a little if there’s no effective trade between themselves and the US, but they’d recover.You know who won’t? The United States.So, everybody thank your President for pissing off your number one trading partner through his petty schoolyard bully tactics.

1,"What is the alternative to implementing tariffs on Chinese goods, or any country's goods, for that matter?",Tariffs,Foreign Policy,1!,1!,1!,1!,"The imposition of tariff against goods from any country is mainly to protect the domestic industry making the same good because the home manufacturer cannot compete openly without imposing a price penalty on the import. Indeed if you listen to Trump, that is what he is supposed to be doing on steel and aluminum when he levied tariff on virtually all import from anywhere else.The unintended consequence of such tariff is to impose penalty on the rest of the domestic economy. In the case of steel and aluminum, the auto industry has been a large buyer of imports. Now whether they buy from domestic supplier or the import, they will pay more for their starting raw material. Chances are they will pass this added cost to the consumer. The net effect is the US steel and aluminum industry gets to protect their employment roll and perhaps even add workers to their payroll, the car companies may have to lay off workers and the American consumer has less money in their pocket.The tariff barrier is called import substitution because it’s a device to keep a more competitive product from entering the domestic market and to prolong the life a less competitive domestic product subsidized by the domestic consumer. During the Reagan era, tariff was imposed on foreign made (specifically Japanese made) cars to keep the US market for the US car makers. It was supposed to be a wake up call for American car makers to get their act together and become competitive. Instead, the first thing the American car makers did was to raise their sticker price to match the imports but with the same crappy cars.The idea of free and open trade (with no unfair or hidden subsidy involved) is to let the most competitive product win in the market place. Everybody has to compete and nobody gets to hide behind a tariff wall.In my view, I don’t believe any country can win by using tariff to combat imports.

Violent video games in multiple studies have been shown to be a release not a causation of violent tendencies. It is very reasonable to assume nerf guns and similar toys would be as well. This is backed by anecdotal evidence. In the 20s through 50s every kid in the US had a toy gun. The murder rate except in the 30s was extremely low. Much lower than it is since such toys became taboo. Thus it is a reasonable conclusion that toy guns do not promote violence later in life. If they did we would have had massive murder rates during that time period. Instead murder rates were in decline as violence became more common in movies and toy guns more popular.

It constantly acts as though conservative and traditional women are bad role models, bad examples of womanhood and if we’d only “get with the program” or “get smart” and get with feminism then we’d be so much better in every single way.It’s patronizing as hell.Beyond that I dislike it for the same reasons that many liberals dislike it:I dislike their insistence on using arguments that have been disproven time and time again such as the supposed gender wage gap and the 1-in-3 rape statistic. Even a few feminists have pointed out that both of these are false but they’re still pushed everywhere in feminism because the narrative and controlling women is more important than facts and honesty.I dislike their insistence that they somehow own the total and exclusive rights to ideas like equality, fairness, justice.

Men aren’t allowed to have any opinions on anything a woman does. Nothing. Not on how they look, how they dress, how they act, what jobs they take. Nothing.

3,Why do Conservatives/Republicans have such a problem with feminists and feminism?,Political Conservatism,Feminism,Republican Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,"I think most modern feminism has its priorities backwards.The feminist movement in some respects is a good thing. It’s made it acceptable for women to work outside the home and ensured they got tons of opportunities they didn’t have before. It made it possible for women to exercise their skills in leadership positions and made sexism socially unacceptable. These are good things.However, a good deal of modern feminism is based on this premise: Women need to be freed up to make “better” choices than simply staying at home and raising children. Modern feminism looks down on women who are content with being a homemaker, reliant on the financial support of her husband, raising children full-time. It gives the impression that they’re wasting their talents when they could be out “accomplishing” something in a career. It gives the impression that the decision to be a full-time stay-at-home mother is somehow lesser than doing what the men do and seeking to advance in a career.What? Seriously? Only in affluent Western culture could we get this so backwards. Only in an incredibly materialistic culture could we say that achieving some letters like CEO or Ph.D beside your name or climbing the corporate ladder is greater than devoting oneself full-time to forming the character of young human beings. Only in a vain culture could we say that achieving a six-figure salary is greater than introducing upstanding human beings into the world. Yet we say that materialistic achievement and accomplishment is what women have been missing out on for the last several millennia. We’ve shown that women are more than capable of doing that, and in the process we’ve given millennials and Generation Z a generation of absentee parents, or divorced parents who in so many cases view themselves as two individuals with two divergent purposes in life. We tell women who use one particular skill to make money that they’ve done something worthwhile, but women who use innumerable different skills to make upstanding human beings that they’ve wasted their talents.Bringing new lives into the world and raising them to be men and women of integrity, character, and compassion who do good for people is, I think, the highest purpose of the family. The people who bring home the money simply make it possible for the family to fulfill that purpose. Is it impossible for one person to do both? No, though it is certainly harder and usually not beneficial for children. But the idea that it’s a waste for a woman to devote herself full-time to that calling is a terrible one. I truly think that there’s a good argument that a stay-at-home mother performs the job of greater long-term significance, and a working father enables her to do it and partners with her in it.Are all careers just a matter of corporate achievement and accomplishment and raises and bonuses? No, and in fact women seem to be very drawn toward those that do directly help develop and save human lives. According to the US Department of Labor, among the top 5 careers for women are teachers, nurses, and health aides.[1] But again, the idea that it’s a waste not to have a career is a product of modern feminism, and a detrimental one to the next generation.Footnotes[1] Most Common Occupations for Women",91,7,245,987,0,1

The exclusion - though pro-life groups were apparently still allowed to participate, just not to sponsor - resulted in a number of thinkpieces about whether one can be pro-life and a feminist, including the link above at The Atlantic.Of course, the March can organize its message however it pleases.

3,Why do Conservatives/Republicans have such a problem with feminists and feminism?,Political Conservatism,Feminism,Republican Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,"We don’t. Not really.Most of us—at least us under 40 crowd—were raised by first and second wave feminists. We have no problem with these feminists. Not at all.We often do have a problem with late third-wavers and fourth wave feminists. We view many of their grievances as petty, non-genuine, and manufactured.That doesn’t mean there aren’t genuine and serious issues which women still face (just as men do). But the histrionic, anecdotal narratives get very tiring, very quickly. A lot of fourth wave feminist positions can’t survive very modest factual inquiry. So, people professing the ideology have itself chosen to become a bit of an echo chamber.Feminism is suffering from “social evaporative cooling”. Most of feminism’s historical, big-agenda items have been—arguably—achieved. As people checkout from the historical feminist movement, it leaves more extreme positions; which excludes more sensible people; which leaves more extreme positions; ad infinitum. In a sense, fourth wave feminism is distilled down to some issues that Republicans and conservatives think are superficial; symptomatic but not causative.Separately, women’s issues are a great political wedge issue for the Democratic Party. The Democratic Party happily appeals to their target demographic, which pushes feminism into a quest for entitlement rather than empowerment.One common example: the partisans discuss the largely non-existent wage gap to no end. And promise to push an “equal pay act”. And people eat it up!Yeah, those damn Republicans!Even though a Republican introduced the Equal Pay Act.In 1963.

1,How do you feel about the clear dislike between party lines during televised events such as the SOTU address? What message does it send to Americans?,State of the Union Addresses,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"It really wasn’t until this latest SOTU address with President Trump that I really took offense to the way the two parties acted towards one another. To me, first I felt they were portraying a group of unprofessional and undignified children that had no control over their petty dislike of one another. It left me feeling ashamed that these were the supposed leaders of the country that I love. The way Nancy Pelosi acted not to mention the rest of them while issues were being addressed and discussed. The fact that they could not even muster the ability to get through the short time the same way they would have expected their children to get through Sundays church service. Sit down, pay attention and show respect to the speaker.I understand the immense hatred that President Trump has commanded from the Dems, but this was live TV… Everyone knows they do not care for him! I can only hope for their sake and the sake of every American citizen being represented that it was only being televised in our country and not world wide. God only knows how bad we look in the publics eye as it is.Prior to Trump being voted in, we had Obama. He tried, but I’m not so sure many men could do much better when having a gun pointed at your head for 4 years straight. The fact that he ran again was in my opinion a testament to the kind of man, Patriot and fool he was! Especially when in public, he is ostracized by the other party and promises were made to make sure nothing would ever get past the senate that he had begun. Politics is such a dirty business… The President is a puppet. He does what the power tells him to. Maybe that’s why everyone is so verbally against Trump. He refuses to play politics in the historically normal way.Now, I voted for Trump, bt quickly bought into the masses and their opinion of him after seeing and hearing some of his lies and the verbiage that had escaped from his lips. However, I am more and more ashamed that I too allowed myself to be swayed by the lies CNN and MSNBC so vehemently spew over the airwaves. News? Where? FOX, sure. The other two? Strictly opinion by self loathing, self proclaimed Political Analysts. Who exactly are these people that have the ear of damn near 70% of the American public? So, they spent 2 years in a Political Science Class and then got a job at their local Newspaper in the Opinion section and began spewing their own opinions that had absolutely no truth to them at all! From there, CNN or MSNBC offered them a $27,000.00 a year salary, a laptop, and 10 minutes a week on air arguing with other likeminded morons about how horrible everything is, but offer absolutely no alternative other than to impeach the current man in power. Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Bush, Obama and now the crème de la crème, Trump! While they constantly bitch, piss and moan about Trump, he is making these idiots careers! If not for him, they’d not a thing to say and never be on air! They ought to be kissing his ass, instead of badmouthing him!It’s funny. If you were to come to this country from a distant planet. Had no idea who we were, who Trump was and then looked at his accomplishments since his taking office, I’m curious as to what your opinion of him might well be? There is no denying what has taken place since he was elected.Let’s get one thing straight here. Before Trump, any other President took credit for anything good or bad regardless of whether he had his hand in it or not… It was the way things worked. True, Trump did not singlehandedly lower unemployment, cause record highs in the stock market, meet with Kim Jong-Un in an unprecedented summit to discuss ending N Koreas Nuclear Weapons Program, nor di he single handedly develop and offer on the open market the Trumpy Bear Teddy Bear, but all this and more took place while he was in office, therefore under the previously set rules, he is responsible for them!It’s ridiculous that because Trump is so hated among a few Americans, (let us not forget that he won the election for Pres which means a shitload of people actually do like him) no matter what good he does, he will always be met with the bad! To me, that is sad… It is childish, and it is not the way I want my Government to portray themselves! I feel sorry for them as they are looked down upon by all other countries because they can’t keep their professional feelings separated from their personal hatred! If it were up to me, I’d get rid of every single one of their crying, sniveling childlike and overpaid asses! Send em back to the PTA or city counsel where they can’t do much more harm! At least Trump is trying… Am I suddenly a Trump lover? No! Just like anyone else, you included if you were honest enough to admit it, I have respect for the good things he has done, and lack there of for the not so good.Is Trump a liar? Absolutely, what politician is not a liar? It is a pre-requisite to the position!Does he speak out of his ass? Again, what politician does not?Is he a racist or bigot? Deep down? Who really knows? Again, does he talk out of his ass? Absolutely!Talking shit about women? Get real you hypocrites! There’s not a man alive (unless you are the Pope) who has not at one time or another talked long shit about women and their sexual parts, so quit lying! He is no different in that regard than the next chauvinistic pig that runs his mouth in a locker room! Trump to me comes off as a guy with little experience in doing it and it shows by the way he tries to get his point across! That’s all! Any man with a penis, has been a disgusting pig in the locker room!I have a feeling Donald Trump is going to surprise a lot of people… The problem is, like I said… Hatred will prevent him from getting any credit for anything good he does!UPDATE - As I sit here and try to stomach the opinionated assholes on MSNBC, they are relentless in reporting that Trump has done absolutely nothing in terms of meeting with Kim Jong-Un… Unbelievable…Must really suck formulating their programming based on what FOX NEWS actually reports as the truth!",70,0,132,746,0,0

Without political parties, elections would be unorganized, disinteresting, and unengaging—they’re one of those things that a democracy produces in order to sustain its own health, like Cabinets and Supreme Court justices (everything/anything out of the Supreme Court, really).Political parties encourage political participation in democracy, but they also undermine that democracy in the process by neglecting personal ideological diversity, tying each person down to a set of beliefs that may not align with his/her own.”",27,0,7,353,0,2

There are so many variables that we simply do not know; far more than is usually the case.The single biggest question is this: What, exactly, is Robert Mueller going to find and disclose?This is a sort of Rorschach Test - asking people what Mueller has found thus far. Virtually everyone is going to project based upon shadows - what questions he is asking, to whom he is issuing subpoenas. Thus far, not a single piece of actual evidence has been released by Mueller.I have tremendous respect for Mueller, and I think he is a deliberate, careful investigator. He has thus far been pretty scrupulous about keeping is cards out of view. As he should. The same cannot be said of the press, who are looking at every single action by the prosecutor and his team so that they can rush out screaming headlines. It surely cannot be said for the President, who tweets out non-sense like a seventh grade girl excluded from a birthday party.What Mueller finds is going to determine what happens in 2020. The Democrats are more or less all in on this, and Trump by the reality that he is at the centre, is as well.If Mueller finds little more than that Michael Cohen paid a porn start to be quiet, and that Trump’s team sought to encourage Russians to dig up dirt on Hillary Clinton, that is going to blow up in the face of the Democrats. On the other hand, if Trump’s team really collaborated with Russians to help them, if there was money laundering, then Trump is not going to even serve out his term.What is the common theme here?It does not matter - at all - whom the Democrats nominate in 2020, which is one of the “arguments” Romney makes (that they will pick a nominee out of the mainstream).If Trump is still in the White House in 2020, it means Mueller did not land a solid blow on Trump. I suspect that there is a chance that, under this scenario, there will be a significant backlash against the Democratic Party, as there was against the GOP for their stupid prosecution of Bill Clinton.If Trump is gone, then the Democrats can go wild and pick a nominee (and VP) that will allow them to pander to their core coalition. If I were a Democratic operative in 2020, I would push for the most liberal, activist nominee that I could. Perhaps go for someone like Kamala Harris, who ticks the black, female, left coast boxes.

2,Will Mitt Romney be correct in his prediction of Trump being reelected?,2020 U.S. Presidential Election,Mitt Romney (politician),1!,1!,1!,1!,"Mitt Romney said President Trump will win the Republication nomination and be reelected based on two things:A strong economy.The Democrats nominating “someone who is really out of the mainstream of American thought.”In my opinion, may be correct only if both of those are true. A strong economy alone will not ensure President Trump’s re-election. However, if the economy remains strong and Democrats nominate someone who is not perceived to be a moderate Democrat - someone who is strong on national defense, pro-business (or at lest not anti-business), and who advocates incremental changes in healthcare and education and not immediate, sweeping reforms - then President Trump will be re-elected.In other words, the Democrats won’t win with Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren or someone very similar.Let the infuriation begin.Pro-Sanders people can cite all the polls and surveys they want. Those who favor an immediate transition to a more “European style” mix of socialism and capitalism can argue the advantages all day long. At the end of the day, undecided voters in the swing states are primarily concerned with the current state of the economy and national security.If Democrats expect to unseat an incumbent President, many must emerge from their self-spun, confirmation-biased cocoon and realize that, though many U.S. voters support change and would prefer a President other than President Trump, they will not be won over by Trump-bashing and condescending dismissals of Republican policies.

1,What would the media coverage look like if the Trump-Kim summit was a Clinton-Kim summit instead?,2018 North Korea-US Summit,Kim Jong-un,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Question: What would the media coverage look like if the Trump-Kim summit was a Clinton-Kim summit instead?Donald Trump is very good at focussing the attention on himself and the media coverage reflects that. It was a tremendous photo-op and Trump claims 100% of the credit for everything, starting with the pacifist South Korean president’s invitation to Kim to send an Olympic team to Seoul and the strong efforts he has made at rapprochement. Kim is interested in making North Korea economically strong and militarily safe. His father and grandfather were willing to sacrifice the well-being of the people of North Korea to maintain a hostile stance toward South Korea and the world at large. President Moon Jae-In deserves huge credit for his massaging of egos. Donald Trump made a big splash and the media loves that splash.I do not think the press coverage would have been as great were it to be a Clinton-Kim summit. She is more knowledgeable and would have been much more prepared. Consider what she would have known and weighed.North Korean presidents have requested one-on-one meetings with the U.S. president before. It both enhances their status and serves as a wedge between the U.S. and other involved parties;North Korea (NK) announced the decision to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in the early 1990’s. In 1994, NK and the U.S. negotiated an agreement to place a hiatus on that withdrawal in exchange for two light-water reactors that could not make material for nuclear weapons and other energy support. That agreement was cancelled in 2002 when both sides said the other was not in compliance;The six-party (North and South Korea, China, Russia, Japan and the U.S.) talks held previously reached a stronger agreement that the current Singapore announcement about denuclearization. That agreement slowed NK’s nuclear development from 2003–2009 when NK dropped out;The agreement as given says nothing about verification. In Reagan’s terms, “trust but verify.” In negotiating terminology, “complete, irreversible, and verifiable dismantlement.”Trump said nothing about other issues such as human rights or NK’s militaristic actions in the region. (You may recall the furor raised by some Republicans when Obama reached an agreement with Cuba that did not include decisions made about human rights). This is the very arrow thrown at the Iran nuclear deal, that it has done nothing to limit Iran’s activities in the region. The counter may be made that NK refused to have put all of that on the table and that is undoubtedly true. The nuclear ballistic capability is our primary concern and other issues can follow later. That is exactly the argument made for the Iran nuclear agreement that was trashed by Trump (such as, “If Iran agrees to stop certain activities, that should be exchanged for allowing them to have more centrifuges — not a good deal for the world);Clinton would not so readily make a concession that throws South Korea under the bus: no mutual readiness exercises (“war games”) with the South Koreas and the U.S. military. There seems to be no recognition that a million NK troops are in readiness just north of the 38th parallel and that NK has said that their capacity for biological and chemical weapons was not on the table for discussion.So there would be absolutely no big media splash for Clinton to equal Trump’s. Such agreements take time, attention to detail (the devil is in the details) and continued pressure, both economic sanctions and military readiness.There is a lot of glitter now. All the presents are wrapped and under the tree. We should wait until those packages are unwrapped before we celebrate. If NK verifiably ends its hostile actions, I will rejoice and laud the agreement and those responsible; I have friends in Seoul who will rejoice with me.",112,0,216,198,0,0

2,Do you think that the Democratic Party should include and respect pro-life liberal voters more?,Liberal Democrats (UK politics),Liberalism (politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"I think the party needs to examine this much more closely: we’re here on Quora making up answers about how the party should deal with those beliefs, and I really like a lot of these answers, but if you’re not a politics-nerd, and if you are someone who believes in providing health care for every American, protecting the environment for the next generation, not engaging in wars lightly and with a cocky attitude about how easy they will be, etc etc and also that life begins at conception, the Democrats haven’t noticed you.They’ll argue about whether you’re allowed in: at what point does a set of views encroach on women’s rights enough that they don’t like you anymore, that you don’t count as ok.*They’ll sort-of listen to your policy needs, the Democrats are good at the actual work of policy: they’re actually serious about that very poorly framed phrase “safe, legal and rare.” Voting for Democrats doesn’t mean more abortions. Around the world, the liberal approach of sex ed, universal education and health care, and support for parents struggling economically all add up to more success at lowering abortion rates than the restrict-and-punish policies that come from the right.What the Democrats don’t do is (1) listen and invite and (2) stick to their frame.A pro-life person can, in reality, get more done to lower abortion rates within the Democratic party than the GOP (make it illegal, create an immediate backlash). But they’re not actually invited to. I think this is tricky: liberals have heard wildly insincere calls to protect fetuses by “Pro-Life” politicians who so clearly don’t give a small damn, and for so long, politicians who would turn on a dime if the winds of politics changed, that they don’t recognizeIt’s very similar to how the Democrats have pushed economic policy that they believe is best for the country, and aimed to creat support and retraining policies for workers displaced by a changing world and by their policies, without coming across as if they are talking with and listening to people who are watching their way of life disappear — in politics you can’t just study them and hand them an effective policy. Many of those voters felt like Trump was listening to them, and in many ways he was paying more attention…. how did they feel, what is life like, that’s not policy, but if you’re listening to someone you’ll know.Democrats need to create a dialogue around pregnancy, choice and women’s empowerment that is much more vibrant than “safe, legal and rare.” That expresses their own beliefs that are “pro-life” (including post-birth) not as a counter to Pro-Life movement, but just state you’re own beliefs with clarity. And that accepts, much more openly, that there are many good people who believe that life begins before birth, and many ways that those beliefs can be acted on that don’t involve being invasive, a subset by government, and invite people to come do that work together. Make it an invitation.For example: The more the government pushes its way into that private decision, the less mental-space people have to check with their own faith. To the extent that government attempts to force the issue, people get angry and defensive, and won’t be open to hearing the message from religious or moral leaders and actually being convinced. The Democrats can say that. They can say that they want to create a world that is more pro-life overall, where we all value each other, and that the best thing the government can do is let people think about their own bodies and their own pregnancies from a place without fear — having that child will not mean a life of poverty, will not mean your child doesn’t get a good education unless you wait till you’re wealthier, etc. They can openly invite people who disagree on this one policy to be part of the conversation and vote with them on every other issue where they agree.###*Also: They don’t maintain a separate set of approaches for politicians (who do have power over women’s body as they enact laws) and voters. The tent, on many issues, needs to be bigger for voters, and then we come together and create a consensus of what the party will do together.",92,0,131,834,0,0
2,Do you think that the Democratic Party should include and respect pro-life liberal voters more?,Liberal Democrats (UK politics),Liberalism (politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"In my brief time at the University of Dayton (one semester prior to transferring), I was part of a pro-life student group.In my time there, they protested exactly zero abortion clinics, donated to exactly zero politicians, tried to influence exactly zero laws, and shamed exactly zero women for their life choices.They recognized, quite practically, that there were reasons that women got abortions, and that if you mitigated those reasons, women would have less abortions. They acted as a support group for expecting mothers, putting together care packages, taking care of transportation, scheduling (and childcare - a lot of the women they helped wanted to have their second kid and just didn’t have enough hours in the day any more), and generally supporting both the institution and the practical reality of motherhood.These women were overwhelmingly poor, single and at the end of their rope. The student group decided to donate their time, their money, and their love to making sure that these would-be mothers got through an incredibly tough time with their life and sanity intact.They were the sort of people who looked at the movie Juno and said not “see? Everyone can do it and everyone should and there’s something wrong with them if they don’t,” but said instead “wow, what if everybody had that level of amazing support network?”They were, in a word, pro-life.Later, when I became politically active, I was baffled why this wasn’t the Republican position. Aren’t we practical? Overturning Roe vs. Wade just wasn’t on the cards, wasn’t it more sensible to do what good we could with our own two hands? Don’t we want the government out of our lives? Why on earth do we want the coercive power of the State telling us what to do with our pregnancies? Isn’t that the most fundamental invasion possible?It was a point of confusion for a good while, until I discovered that the methods of the pro-life student group were in line with the Democratic position. The centrist Democratic position, to be sure, but “support mothers to reduce the demand for abortions while edging out abortion providers by not providing them federal funds” is, in fact, the politics of the likes of Tim Kaine.The Democratic Party already includes and respects pro-lifers, if by pro-lifers you mean people who want to reduce abortions by providing support to mothers so they no longer feel they need abortions (and sex-ed to women who don’t want to be mothers).God, do they suck at selling it, though.

There are several problems with their assertions:Pro-life areas have higher abortion rates (and higher death rates) than pro-choice areas, since pro-lifers have chosen, in action, to be against sexual education, contraception, and protection for women women before or after they’re abused… thus robbing them of the opportunity to avoid unwanted pregnancies in the first place. In terms of ending abortion, pro-choice policies have been much more successful.Pro-life people, in for whom and on what they vote, demonstrate a disdain for the living. As soon as a woman is forced to give birth against her will, as often as not, both the mother AND the child get slandered as parasites or moochers to be abandoned and attacked. Add to this voting against education and equal rights, which then render those childrens’ lives significantly worse and more likely to result in taking up crime or getting pregnant with yet more unwanted/too-soon/economically unviable pregnancies, to further repeat the process and ruin more lives, cyclically.Democrats have absolutely no reason to ‘respect’ this disastrous approach to a difficult issue.",113,5,74,941,0,0
2,Do you think that the Democratic Party should include and respect pro-life liberal voters more?,Liberal Democrats (UK politics),Liberalism (politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"Yes.The question of where life begins is a question of ontology and depending on where you define that, the answer will likely inform your views on abortion.Because such a definition is arbitrary, a pro life positon that believes life begins at conception is no less valid than a pro choice belief that disagrees.I don't think liberals appropriately convey these nuances in their arguments (and vice versa to be fair) and usually just retort that, “it's a woman's choice”. However, this fails to address the ontological status debate and probably does so because such a debate has no objective winner.The unfortunate consequence of this is that pro life people view the pro choice position as inhumane bordering on sociopathic.In general, American politics has a very polarized and simplified (due to the heated talking points) discourse on the subject.Not all pro life people just want to control womens' bodies. Some are focused on the “right to life” as enshrined in our founding documents and the humanity of a fetus. I don't see those as bad people.Democrats need to be more sympathetic to this position and address it properly by having a detailed discussion over ontological status; laying out their opinion on where they define life beginning (which may be when sentience develops later in the pregnancy).I want to take this opportunity to bring up an idea I think would greatly serve the world and give something to both pro life and pro choice people. I think most would rather see less abortion, and more proactive birth control. Government should provide and encourage every teenager of sexual mature age to take birth control. I believe the single greatest underlying problem in humanity is overpopulation. It leads to over consumption and depletion of resources and the environment. It leads to poverty. It leads to more crime and warfare. Societal stress overall and the increased stress and competition between individuals. Unwanted pregnancy is correlated with crime, poverty, less education, mental illness, malnourishment, and other issues in society. Nazi Germany used eugenics. China enforced a one child policy. These were unethical, but we now have a humane solution because we now have the technology to empower the individual. If we can temper hormonal teenagers, we can give them the ability to grow up a bit, mature a little, become more responsible, seek an education and career, follow their dreams, and then, when they are ready, have WANTED children they can care for.I would like to shift the focus off of the abortion topic, and start talking about the proactive solution we've had for years now.",61,0,6,131,0,0

He has insulted reporters on camera and forced them into cages at his rallies. It will take years to repair this damage.He has made it not only acceptable but common for the president to lie.

5,What does Trump need to do to solidify himself as the greatest president in the history of the United States?,Fox News (cable news network),Republican Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"What would he need to do? He would have to use his majority in the 3 branches of government to significantly change the system for the better.First, fulfill his campaign promise to drain the swamp. That means a constitutional amendment explicitly stating that organizations are not people, and do not have the same rights as people. Then, a constitutional amendment stating that money is not speech, and that the donation of money to candidates for political office is to be strictly regulated and limited to individuals only. Finally, a constitutional amendment establishing term limits on all elected officials, and stating that no official can take a job out of office with any organization they oversaw while in office, or any organization who directly benefited from their actions while in office. We pay these people a retirement salary for a reason - specifically to avoid these potential quid=pro-quo deals. It’s time we enforce them.Second, take drastic steps to stimulate the economy by recognizing that it is a strong middle class that produces a strong economy, and you cannot have a strong middle class while the majority of the country’s wealth is held in the hands of a few at the top. We need to raise minimum wage to a livable level (3x the average cost of a single individual residence in any given area), and establish a maximum compensation (salary, benefits, bonuses, and stocks) for any executive of no more than 50x the total compensation of the lowest compensated employee. They want to make more, they have to pay more. In addition, every publicly traded company needs to be at least 40% employee owned. It’s time for employees to have a direct say in how their companies are run. Unions perform a necessary function, but they have their problems. A direct say would bypass the need for unions and give them a true voice in the workplace.Third, universal health care. Obamacare was good for what it was, but it doesn’t go far enough. Health care cannot run in a capitalist system because it doesn’t respond to capitalist market forces. You as a consumer can control costs because you can shop around. You can see what each grocery store is selling their bread for, and if one of them is way outside the norm, you can decide not to shop there. This is how we control prices. This is competition, and supply/demand at work. Competition requires you to be able to see what value you are getting, and how much it costs. When the supply is greater than the demand for a product, prices go down. When demand is greater than supply, prices go up. When they are roughly equal, prices stabilize. So, look at your health care. Do you know how much your doctor would charge you for any specific service? Do you know how that compares to other doctors in the area? No, so there is no true competition. Now, if you decide that your doctor is charging too much, can you choose to refuse treatment? If every doctor in the area is charging 2 million to set your broken leg, can you choose not to have your leg set? No. When your options are “pay or suffer lifelong pain and crippling injury”, even “pay or die”, you pay. You have no choice, so your control over demand is gone. The two major market forces to control prices in a capitalist market, and health care is immune to both of them. This is why every other developed country in the world has some form of socialist health care, and why we need it as well.Fourth, education. We need to drastically revamp our education system to be able to provide for the changes in our society. We’re using a model that has been mostly unchanged since we were living on farms. The last major update was to model it more like an assembly line, to turn out assembly line students for working on assembly lines. We need a system that will prepare students for the modern world. And we need to make it affordable, so that people aren’t saddled with extremely high debt right out of school. Affordable college, affordable trade schools, incentives for companies to provide paid internships and on the job training, etc. It doesn’t have to be free, but it shouldn’t be decades of crushing debt. Our parents and grandparents could pay for a year of college with a single summer job. We need to go back to that.Fifth, deal head on with the issues of bigotry in the country. Hate groups need to be loudly condemned. We need to do more to deal with instances of rape and sexual assault. Police need to be heavily screened for any hint of bigotry or bias, and removed from their job if there is. They also need to be trained to de-escalate situations, and deal with problems peacefully first, resorting to violence only when absolutely necessary. We also need to be doing more in our schools to counter the influence of bigotry and promote empathy (which will have the added benefit of reducing or eliminating school shootings). Frankly, teaching a child to hate should be considered child abuse.Of course, he won’t do any of this, because he’s a greedy, bigoted, selfish ass who will go down (hopefully sooner rather than later) as the worst president in the history of the US.",95,3,2,35,0,0

However, the Republican Party cannot have their head in the sand, as many of those racists that fled the Democratic party, found shelter in their own party. Saying the former, without acknowledging and shedding the latter, makes Republicans look disingenuous.Second, reinforce your belief that it is about the individual who becomes successful, not about the group of people. Without going into terminology that may be deemed racist. Every group of people has amazing people, and people who are atrocious. The negative or horrific actions of a few, shouldn’t mark an entire group.Third, come into the African American communities and speak about your solutions. To give an example of this, all the candidates in the NYC mayoral primary election in 2013 were invited to spend a day in NYCHA housing, and to understand the issues with pubic housing. Most of the Democratic candidates did so, while the two Republican candidates declined. It is very rare to see a Republican come into the community during an election year.Also, keep in mind, this is not a change that will happen overnight.

This is because I personally faced a lot of hardship and adversity that “conservative” policies simply could not adequately address - and this was not counting a childhood spent basically on food stamps (and later in foster care), but AFTER receiving a college degree and entering the workforce. (And, I might add, also being perfectly qualified for the workforce, including from a “culture” and “employability” standpoint.)I will always believe that the best solutions for the issues America (and the world) faces come from the left side of the aisle/spectrum. I will always vote for true liberals and leftists, and I’m becoming less inclined to support even centrists and those who want “middle ground.”That said, if Republicans want to broaden their support outside of the rather tiny percentage of Black Americans who identify as conservative:1) Renounce “white supremacy” once and for all and actually help eradicate it. Aggressively prosecute and imprison domestic terrorists who attack ethnic minorities simply for being alive - or threaten to do so. This includes white supremacists who have infiltrated our law enforcement agencies. Reject people in your party who hold such views and let them know they will not be allowed to hold positions of authority, or public office, with those views.2) Actually accept and acknowledge that America rightfully belongs to Black people just as much as it does anyone else - and base ALL your policy decisions on that. Vet ALL your potential candidates - from county dog catcher to POTUS - based on that. Do not deny ANY American the right to cast their vote for the candidate of their choice. This means no gerrymandering, no voter suppression, and restoring civil rights, including voting rights, to ex-offenders who served their time.2a) This also means America actually starts to find a way to accept and integrate the “tired, poor and huddled masses yearning to breathe free” instead of calling them, and treating them like, “criminals” and “animals”. Give people (including non-white people) from other lands the right to come to our country and become proud and productive Americans. And give meaningful and REAL solutions to underdeveloped parts of the world so those people have a greater chance to have a decent life in their own countries.3) Stop your unrestrained idolization of the “free market.” There IS a place for a government of “We The People” to work on behalf of ALL Americans. And the corporate and business sector DOES need to be held significantly and dramatically MORE accountable than it is right now.4) Allow for a free and fair journalistic profession that has the full legal, social and financial freedom to report truthful and accurate news, that holds the powerful accountable, without fear or favor.Edit: Thanks to everyone for your kind comments, affirmations and suggestions.",14.9k,1.3k,146,160,0,0

Your Senators and Representatives are so weak that even if they don’t agree with him, they don’t display any principled opposition.

If a policy is disproportionately harmful to the black population (even if said policy is not specifically overtly racial), the policy is racist and discriminatory. If you're ok with that, then you are ok with racism. The GOP famously supports policies that may not be racist in letter but are racist in results.When the black community was ravaged by the scourge of crack, we had the war on drugs, zero tolerance, and “just say no”. Now that heroin and pills have hit the white community, we have the opiod crisis and addiction intervention. It's the same problem, but the solution goes from being punitive for blacks to theraputic for whites.

15,How can we as Republicans connect with the African American community?,African Americans,Republican Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"First of all realize that in order to make that connection, this isn’t a quick scheme that will pay dividends in November 2018. The GOP hasn’t gotten more than 15% of the black vote in a presidential election since 1960. It took years to get to this situation and it will take years to change. I mention that because in 2013 the RNC started to try and reach out to the black community after they lost to Obama. However, many of the GOP voters didn’t want that and ended going in a different direction.First, the GOP as a whole has to be willing to make changes, and be able to communicate those changes. In my 40 years (and probably longer) the GOP has only made 3 arguments to black voters. 1. - The Democrats haven’t fixed your problems 2. We aren’t as racist as you have been led to believe. In fact, Democrats are the real racists. 3. The rising tide from our policies will lift all boats. We can debate whether or not these arguments are true, but that is irrelevant. These arguments are over 40 years old and are demonstrably ineffective. Asking ‘what the hell do you have to lose’, got 8% of the black vote in 2016. Asking it again won’t magically get 25% in 2020.Second, the personal attacks have to stop. If you disagree with someone, please argue hard and argue long. However, attack the policy not the person. You don’t like Obama? You don’t have to, but maybe let’s leave his dead parents out of this. You disagree with that athlete or group of athletes? Great, have fun. Suggesting that they should shut up and dribble, be fired, or kicked out of the country isn’t going to persuade anyone to change their vote to your side. The next time someone calls a black person a monkey (or child of one), don’t bring up the 1st amendment. The 1st amendment does give people the right to be foolish, but no human being in the history of democracy has been insulted to the point of changing their vote.Finally, come to us, listen, and react. I can’t turn on the news without some republican talking about lowest black unemployment ever. The 10% of the black population who rated the economy as their primary issue already vote GOP. How many protests have you seen by black voters asking for lower taxes? How many marches for business deregulation? I live in SW Atlanta. It is home to 4 historically black colleges, dozens of black churches, and some of the wealthiest black suburbs in America. Republicans from outside of GA never come to speak to us. Every Republican in America claims to be an expert on Chicago’s problems. Every Republican in America avoids going to Chicago. Don’t go to rural PA to talk about us. Go to north Philly and talk to us. We are speaking clearly about what we want and the GOP doesn’t listen. We are talking about voter suppression. The GOP tries to explain why we shouldn’t feel that way. We talk about college affordability to climb the economic ladder. The GOP says we shouldn’t want to go to 4 year college. We complain about violence and all we get is told that Chicago is your problem - fix it yourself. Donald Trump campaigned that if he won, he would help Chicago and other places with violent crime. He won. I can’t think of a better time in history for a Republican party in DC to make the case to black voters that they can offer a better way. What has Trump proposed to help Chicago???You want to know why many of us vote Democratic? Many of us are scared for our rights and our safety. The Democrats show up and treat our pain as legitimate. Republicans say (far away from any major city) that local police with tanks aren’t a problem. Nosy IRS agents are the real problem.

He can present himself as effectively “a friend of the US” which means people are less likely to cold shoulder him or attempt to overthrow him etc (not that there was any real risk of him getting over thrown anyway), China will probably buy more of his coal now (NKs main export) and probably sell him more technology (NK loves to buy tech, especially anything with a military application) as China isn’t going to expect sanctions against it or diplomatic problems from the US now that Trump needs to try and not receive threats from Kim.

Our system is woefully inadequate for caring for our citizens, and INSANELY inefficient.But so-called “fiscal conservatives” won’t give it a single thought because that means some “less deserving” people will still get care. (Because obviously, being RICH means you’re a worthwhile human being and not being rich means you aren’t)Supply Side (Trickle Down) EconomicsThey tried it under Reagan. They tried it under Bush. They’ve done it again under Trump. Give away the farm to the wealthy and they’ll hire more people, and make more money for everyone.Nope. Doesn’t work that way.Economic growth is not driven by an over-supply of money on the side of the already wealthy. You know what happens when you give a rich person more money than they need? They don’t go out and hire more workers just because they have more money in the bank. They invest it in stocks, bonds, etc. Those stocks and bonds may grow, but that doesn’t translate to jobs.Economic growth is driven by demand. If you give the average American $1,000, he doesn’t invest in a diversified portfolio - he buys that TV he’s been putting off, or school clothes for his kids, or puts a down payment on that car he needs. Multiply that times 120 million American families, and you’ve got an economic powerhouse that no tax cut for the rich can ever match.Military Over-SpendingThe US spends more on its military than the next seven countries combined. So-called “conservatives” want to spend even MORE. How is that a fiscally sound choice? If our country is in so much trouble that we can’t even take care of sick kids, how can we afford to spend billions of dollars on more ways to kill people?Coal and OilFossil fuels are a long-term losing proposition. Investing US resources in increasing coal and oil production is not only worse for the environment and public health than other, cleaner energy sources, it’s a losing financial position. They’re chasing tiny short-term gains while ignoring enormous long-term losses._Basically, Republicans can bill themselves as “fiscal conservatives” because they create deficits by cutting taxes without corresponding spending cuts, and they rail against providing any services to “unworthy” Americans.They paint Democrats as “tax and spend” because Democrats want to provide services and jobs for people who don’t have them now, and they want to pay for it with taxes on those they see as being able to “afford” it.",298,14,374,911,0,0
3,In what ways is the Republican Party not fiscally conservative?,Political Conservatism,Republican Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"Sadly, I am not sure that the term “fiscally conservative” has any real meaning in federal budget management any longer.A fiscally conservative approach to the budget would include consideration of the following:total funds availabletotal funds spent, with questions of allocationimplications for the present and the future (that is, the “conserve” part of conservative)attempts to maximize valueeffects on debtLet’s examine a few test cases. First, we can look at the military, which is the top modifiable expenditure in our federal budget. Is there any legislator from either party who asks the simple question, how much money do we have, and how much do we want to allocate to the military? If we simply reduced the military allocation by 2% per year, the amount saved would be extraordinary. The implications for the present and future would be use of older equipment for a bit longer, reduction in personnel, higher scrutiny in development of some weapons programs, or something else. This dovetails directly with maximizing value. Do all new fighter planes developed really advance the mission of the Air Force? Perhaps elimination of an airplane of only marginal improved value would allow all transport carriers in hostile areas to be fully armored. Let’s not answer this question; rather, the discussion needs to take place. The effect on debt is clear; in a time such as the present, in which much of every dollar spent leads to an increase in debt, reduction in the military budget would decrease debt relative to overall federal revenue. Hopping back to the question of total funds available, if we really believe that the military needs to be as large as it is, perhaps we need to increase revenue to support it - that means raising taxes or taking out more loans.Second, we can examine healthcare. I’ll keep this discussion shorter, because there is no greater mismatch between fiscal conservatism and healthcare expenditure in the US today. Simply put, the US healthcare system is the worst healthcare value in the world. Americans pay about twice as much per individual on healthcare as comparable countries, but outcomes (such as life expectancy and infant mortality) are at best in the middle of the pack. The American healthcare system does little to incentivize value, and there is almost no consideration of funds available and funds spent. When there was a mature, rational attempt to maximize fiscal viability of the Affordable Care Act (a program that has improved outcomes while decreasing spending), Republicans decried the “individual mandate”, which was the necessary cog to ensure the ability of the program to remain financially secure.So, I am not sure that either party is financially conservative in any way. However, the Republican approach of minimizing revenue (cutting taxes), expanding the military without consideration of safeguards, and ignoring considerations of value is as far from fiscal conservatism as I can imagine. This is not the once impressive Republican party of Dwight Eisenhower, but a coalition of social conservatives, tax-haters, gun-lovers, and America-firsters. Sad, indeed.",145,2,177,464,0,0

First off, there are the moderates who generally want continuity of the USA as we know it. At the other end of the extreme are the hardliners, the Tea Party types, who are a version of the Republic of Gilead. It is important to note not all Tea Party people are Gilead-style extremists: many are (you could say they infiltrated this movement) but more are moderates who believe in less taxes and more economic freedom. Then, there is Donald Trump, who is almost an independent and who is informed moreso by what he terms as ‘the art of the deal’ and business than politics. For moderates, his methods are unconventional and for hardliners, he poses as threat because his unconventional approaches to world issues may just about achieve moderate goals and isolate hardliners further.Trump no doubt is taking risks but if he achieves a few big positive events, then efforts to undermine him will be hard. If events backfire, then undermining him will be easier. Like all presidents, events can come up out of the blue which he may have to show leadership on. Here are a few possibilities:A. Adverse weather or natural disasters.B. A major terrorist attack in New York or another main city.C. A revolution in Iran.D. World economic difficulties.E.

Their text based news coverage is generally alright as far as I have read, most of their articles are simple reporting of facts. Their selection of stories to cover does not typically differ all that much from other outlets. They do cover some things that the more leftist outlets neglect covering, or downplay.They are significantly more balanced with Trump than any other news station has been with either Trump or Obama. The last time that I checked the ratio of coverage was near 50%. Progressives will tell you that anything other than 100% negative coverage is bias, I guess that makes sense if you think that Hitler is the president.Like any news station, many of their articles are pretty objectively free from bias. The bias comes with the selection of what to cover, and in that 10% of articles that are more than just reporting on everyday stuff.They have so far survived in my Quora feed, they have had 2 or 3 borderline block worthy articles, but that makes them undoubtedly the best quality general news source that Quora's tried to show me.

By some counts, as many folks lost their existing plans as new people were covered. To many, it looks more like a government run health care redistribution program, rather than an effort to honestly provide quality health care to more people.Many people have found their premiums, co-pays, and out of pocket costs sky rocket, while their choice of doctors and plans shrank and disappeared.

And what I pay for it has gone up exponentially.So it is unclear if efforts to eliminate specific parts of Obamacare would be a political mistake or not. For those people who got covered in the Medicaid expansion or who got tax subsidies, they will be upset to lose them. But they are a small subset of the population, I suspect.On the other hand Republicans learned it is very difficult to take something away, once the government has provided it; so they probably will not attempt another full out repeal again soon. This leaves chipping away at it as their current option. One could make an argument that they should select the pieces to eliminate carefully to avoid political mistakes. But who decides what is ‘a political mistake’. The constituencies of each party are different and may have different views on this. I personally think the elimination of coverage for pre-existing conditions is the most politically perilous, because I think most people might benefit from it. But I realize that is just my opinion.Something does have to happen, though. Since the passage and implementation of the Affordable Care Act, health care in America has become dramatically less affordable. So perhaps they should select what to chip away based upon whether they are big cost drivers, or based upon cost to benefit analysis, rather than selecting health care options based upon political motives.“If the majority of Americans support specific parts of Obamacare (tax subsidies, increased Medicaid, coverage for pre-existing conditions, etc), are the current Republican actions to eliminate them a political mistake?”",129,3,76,100,0,0

2,What are some commonalities between President Trump and the Republican establishment?,Republican Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"That’s a tough one. Trump has much more in common with the Republican party of the past than the one that we see today. The Republican Party today is heavily influenced by special interests and donations, which was much less the case in the past. This has paralyzed both the Democrats and the Republicans and has made it so that a lot of bills that get passed are to the benefit of companies, not the actual voters.In a democracy, it doesn’t matter how many voters turn out, just that you win the election. This is certainly a flaw in American democracy.However, he has much in common with the Republican establishment of the past. Republicans, in the past, were a little more pragmatic than Democrats. They would make deals with unsavory foreign actors such as the Soviet Union and China under Chairman Mao. These guys stuck out their necks will full faith that the US could take on these foreign powers if we all put the pedal to the metal and worked together.Today, Trump certainly agrees with the Republicans on their approach to the creme de la creme. Though he stayed remarkably distant from passing the tax bill, the Republicans fashioned and passed a bill that benefits mostly people in Trump’s tax bracket. Republicans take a lot of money from rich people, including the Koch Brothers… In this way, they are in line with Trump and his interests.Trump also is very unapologetic and isn’t afraid to break a few eggs to get something done. The Democrats are a bit more meek and diplomatic, while Republicans are more hard-nosed and have become notorious as the filibuster party.In this way, Trump and the Republicans are similar - they both will threaten and posture to get their way, even if by force. Republicans threaten to shut down the government every few years though, obviously, this is neither to their benefit nor the Democrats’ benefit. However, they’ve always been a bit Rebellious, those sillies…Republicans also value loyalty, much like Trump does. Vice President Pence, for example, voted almost exclusively Republican when he was in Congress. He voted with the Republicans over 95% of the time… He was and is unwavering to the party. Trump appreciates this same loyalty from his inner circle and his advisers.Trump and the Republicans also advocate quite hard for freedom of speech and protect the second amendment fiercely.Finally, Trump and the Republicans also want to crack down much harder on illegal immigration, though they probably have met their match with California. They can posture all they want, but both ultimately have respected states’ rights, though they aren’t all that happy about it.For the record, I didn’t vote for Trump! I know a lot of people assume that others did if they don’t blatantly say this and put the guy in any sort of positive light… I just thought I’d be clear, here!Thank you for reading! :D",52,0,8,57,0,0

1,Is lesser social mobility what America wants for their next generation? Is that why taxes do matter?,Republican Party (US politics),Taxes,1!,1!,1!,1!,"This is a good question. The answer I’m going to give is probably not what you had in mind.Higher income tax rates absolutely impact social mobility. One of the greatest challenges to large businesses are smaller businesses and individuals who devise better ways at providing products and services to the country and world. Once someone develops a successful idea, one of the main problems they have with growth is the sustainability of the growth along with financing growth. Publicly traded companies have the option of going out to public capital markets, but the small entrepreneur doesn’t have the same option.Often times the only source of financing for growth are funds from the small business owner’s pocket. These funds are limited to begin with and one of the major limiting factors to going from a small business to a mid-sized business, or from a mid-sized business to a large business is that of LACK of capital.Income tax rates for someone making more than 150k per year can reach as high as 54%. Granted, you would have to live in California and your income would have to exceed 1 million dollars to hit that, but even an income level of 300k would cause your tax rates to be in the mid to upper 40s percent wise.And this absolutely, unequivocally impacts social mobility. The higher the taxes, the higher the regulations, the more locked in the status quo is. Small business owners will quite often not be able to move up the social ladder because tax rates are so high.",252,0,811,139,0,0

Whenever any subject is broached, it becomes apparent.Climate change: Every country in the world which can afford a college or university has at least a meteorological tower up somewhere, and monitors the wind, temperature and weather. They like to share that information with everybody who asked, in order to get information back. In many cases, for hundreds of years.Two hundred years ago, the British, French, Dutch, Spanish, and Portuguese mariners would drop a thermometer in the water, because if there was a temperature rise, it meant they had entered, what we know now as the Gulf Stream, and they were getting close to the North American continent (a rocky hard place). They wrote it diligently in their log books. Climate change is not just an “American Liberal, or Chinese conspiracy” it is world wide.The “deep state,” intelligence community, conspiracy against Trump, completely ignores the fact that every EU country, and especially those in NATO, have their own intelligence services. They all are different, with different abilities and assets, and they all share, especially when it concerns an adversarial country like Russia.A communique between the Russian ambassador to the US in DC, and Moscow is fair game going over Europe, and many of our allies have human assets within Russia. The FBI, CIA and NSA are not working in a vacuum, and the Dutch, British, French, Italian and Poles, Canadians,etc.etc. have no laws requiring them to redact the name of the American, if there is one, on the other end of the line.With assets inside the US, Russian intelligence would like to protect them, and therefore would really like to know how a FISA warrant works.

That’s the reason why congressional Republicans rarely vote as a unified block.There’s three major divisions: the Conservatives, the Moderates, and the Libertarians.The Conservative Wing has three subcategories: the Christian right (a.k.a. the religious right), neoconservatives (e.g., Tea Party), and the traditionalists. The priority of these groups is cultural/values issues (religious issues, abortion, gun rights, free speech, etc.).Then there’s the “Moderate Wing,” to which I belong, aka Business Conservatives. They’re derogatorily called them “Republicans In Name Only (RINOS)” by other right-wing factions. Business conservatives are exclusively focused on what benefits business and do not care about cultural issues.Then there’s the “Libertarian Wing,” which has a whole different set of priorities. They are highly suspicious of government and oppose government solutions to virtually everything.Until you understand these intra-party divides, you can’t understand why the Republican Party is powerful and why Republicans keep getting elected.Please read the following scenarios to understand the differences in these groups.How would each group answer a question about climate change?Conservative: Climate change is probably a hoax /or/ humans don’t cause it.Moderate: I support sustainable business practices as long as they make financial sense.*Libertarian: Climate change is real, but I wouldn’t trust the government to solve it. The solution needs to come from the private sector.How would each group respond to a question about abortion, gay marriage, etc.?Conservative: These things are morally wrong and should be illegal.Moderate: These issues are not important to me /or/ I’m pro-life but not likely to lobby for pro-life causes /or/ I’m pro-choice.Libertarian: These things should be legal because the government should not regulate it.How would each group respond to a question about immigration?Conservatives: Mass immigration takes jobs away from hard-working Americans and threatens our values when immigrants don’t assimilate.Moderates: It should be easier to immigrate because immigration benefits business.Libertarian: The government is too inept to be allowed to control the flow of labor via immigration.*Note that the business conservative does not take a position on whether climate change is real.I could go on and write a whole book about this.

5,What is something that needs to be said about Republicans?,Current Events in U.S. Politics,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"That the hardline stance on immigration will most definitely benefit Republicans.Hear me out.Two dumb things happened in the last several days: The Trump administration separated children from their parents as they, many of them illegally, crossed the border into the United States, and the Democrats assumed that the subsequent outcry over this decision would fundamentally alter the political landscape.This flap over family detention has again laid bare a debate that worked in Trump's favor in 2016 and could still help him and the Republican Party win in 2018 and 2020: One party prefers tighter immigration restrictions and one party leans toward relaxed enforcement. Trump himself made that case in a speech in Las Vegas over the weekend, when he cited in fiery terms Democrats' desire for ""open borders"" on a campaign swing designed to boost the fortunes of incumbent Republican Dean Heller.Democrats are likely to be disappointed when they poll this issue. My guess is that a majority of Americans will feel the same about Trump before and after, and some may even like him more. The right is not going to fall out of this presidency over Trump taking a position that conforms with his hardline anti-immigration stance. I imagine a negligible number of Trump supporters will abandon their support for him over this policy.Regarding what to do with the immigrant families once they are detained, Democrats should not assume wide support for the position taken by Sen. Kamala Harris of California -- essentially, release them inside the United States pending a hearing. While most polling shows that Americans view legal immigration as a positive thing for the United States, a sizable portion of Americans would likely prefer to keep the families together before deporting them to their country of origin -- as opposed to releasing them inside the United States. Most voters welcome people coming here legally, but believe illegal immigration is a serious problem.Being candid about Trump's decision to engage in a policy leading to family separation, surely the White House wishes it could have that one back. The President wound up reversing course via executive order after days of painful images and audio recordings created a public outcry. Shifting explanations from various administration officials made the position untenable, and the President smartly put an end to it last Wednesday, although Trump can take solace in former Department of Homeland Security Director Jeh Johnson's admission on Fox News on Sunday that the Obama administration did, in fact, detain some children alone.As for the Democrats, they couldn't take yes for an answer. After clamoring for the President to end his administration's policy, they moved the goalposts as soon as he did. What started as a demand to stop separating families has morphed into a call to stop detaining the families altogether.Harris, a possible 2020 presidential candidate, tweeted that ""Indefinitely detaining children with their families in camps is inhumane and will not make us safe."" In other words, she wants the families caught and released into the United States. She went further, asking other senators to support her ""DONE Act to prohibit the expansion or construction of new detention facilities.""Where are we supposed to put the people caught illegally passing into the United States if we don't have enough detention facilities? The answer, of course, is nowhere. Harris doesn't seem to want them detained at all.While President Trump was wrong to move to the harsh penalty of separating children from their families, Democrats are playing with fire by putting catch-and-release at the top of their agenda. Americans clearly believe we need stronger borders, even as they prefer the families be kept together before being shipped home.Left-wing political and media figures are playing into the President's hand by trying to delegitimize his concerns about criminals crossing our borders.While Blow isn't wrong that some criminals were sent here from England in the 1700s (before the US was an independent nation), I'd like to see a congressional candidate use that as a rationale for a position of catch-and-release in the fall election. Good luck!Beyond that, whatever Trump's family separation position cost the Republican Party politically has more than been erased by hysterical comments like those from Democrats like Rep. Maxine Waters, who called for the public to ""create a crowd"" to ""push back on"" Trump administration officials. She included a startling call to action: ""If you see anybody from that Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd. You push back on them. Tell them they're not welcome anymore, anywhere!"" Her remarks followed incidents of harassment targeted at Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders and Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, who were run out of public places.Impeachment fever is certainly bad for the Democrats.Americans across the political spectrum can have reasonable — even fierce — policy disagreements, but calling for angry mobs to hound political enemies will strike most Americans as dangerous. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi referred to Waters' comments in a tweet as ""unacceptable,"" but also blamed Trump's ""lack of civility"" as a provoking factor. The fact is that voters may not want to trust control of the government to people who believe in mob justice over civil discourse.But while the outcry over immigration policy isn't likely to doom any of GOP's chances at winning, Republicans still have work to do.

Absolutely, but it is electoral fraud, including purge lists that keep hundreds of thousands of legitimate voters from voting, voter suppression laws that discourage voting in Democratic-leaning areas, and of course the great rigging of American elections, the Electoral College, created by slave owners to create a firewall against the People and allowing them, a distinct minority, to rule the new nation, with 10 of the first 12 Presidents having owned slaves the first President, elected by 43,000 propertied white males in a nation of 3 million, being the richest and largest slave owner and the second President in the top 1% of slave owners.The Electoral College, in our new century has worked as planned: it has allowed a group of 538 party hacks to overturn 2 of the last 3 elections, giving us the catastrophic disaster of George Bush and the continuing trainwreck of Donald Trump, both of whom lost the popular vote but were declared the winners by the Electoral College, which violates both key principles on which the nation was founded, as expressed in the Declaration of Independence: for a ruler to be legitimate and just, Jefferson wrote, there must be equality (small rural conservative states have 3 1/3 more voting weight per voter than the large states where most Americans live) and consent of the governed.By definition, the loser of the public vote cannot claim to have their consent: consent, as Jefferson wrote, comes from the majority, or at least (in a split vote) by the person with the most votes/consnt and can never be claimed by the loser.And so we see that while voter fraud is a fake scandal, electoral fraud is legal and enshrined in a Constitution which betrayed our founding principles and makes it possible for the ultimate absurdity, that the loser of the vote of the people governed would be declared the ruler.",103,3,186,560,0,0

3,How seriously did the GOP take the election of 1940? Robert Taft and Thomas Dewey looked like stronger candidates than Wendell Wilkie and Roosevelt did not do much more to get renominated than stop other candidacies.,Wendell Willkie,1940 Presidential Election,Thomas Dewey,1!,1!,1!,"First, consider the GOP’s performance in 1932 and 1936. In 1932 Hoover had campaigned hard, but everywhere he faced angry, hostile crowds. Garbage was repeatedly thrown at his entourage (security in those days was a lot less tight than it is now). His placards and the like were routinely vandalised. With unemployment upwards of 20% of the workforce, with the economy contracting violently (by about 25% since 1929), with hundreds of thousands of people standing in breadlines, Herbert Hoover and the GOP were unimaginably unpopular, and the gigantic landslide which overwhelmed Hoover and the GOP reflected that unpopularity.By 1936 unemployment (if you count people getting a paycheque on the first of the month as employed) had dropped to 9.9%; the economy had experienced three straight years of massive growth (close on 33% from 1934 to 1936); and Roosevelt was, unsurprisingly, exceedingly popular. It was difficult campaigning against Roosevelt, and his opponent, Alf Landon (who actually supported most of the New Deal), barely campaigned at all. In 1936 the GOP, unsurprisingly, lost in the biggest landslide in the popular vote (since the popular vote started being recorded) and in the biggest landslide in the electoral college since 1820 when Monroe had run unopposed.That is the background to the campaign of 1940. The GOP had a massive hole to climb out of. It also faced the fact that the New Deal, notwithstanding the so-called “recession within the depression” in 1937 and 1938, was still stunningly popular. Now look at the top contenders for the nomination. Believe it or not, Hoover was trying for it, and he had actually had some support. Obviously, for anyone in touch with reality, this was a non-starter. The nominee had to be a fresh face, someone whom voters were not going to associate with the crash and with the depression, with the breadlines and the soup kitchens, with all the Hoovervilles, and so on.And there were new faces. There was Bob Taft, senator from Ohio — who had been elected in 1938, i.e. had been in office for a year-and-a-half by the summer of 1940. Taft was a masterful and highly effective legislator, but much less impressive in front of an audience at a campaign rally. (He owed his position in the Senate largely to his political connexions and his family ties — he was the son of a former President and a former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and his family enjoyed good name recognition and enduring popularity in Ohio.) He was also an ardent opponent of the New Deal — point for detailed point. Taft would try for the nomination again and again; he came closest in 1952 when the nod went to Eisenhower instead. As regards Taft’s principled and unwavering opposition to every aspect of the New Deal and how this opposition was viewed in many quarters within the GOP of the time: Eisenhower once famously remarked of the main New Deal programmes’ critics that “they are few, and they are stupid”. With that attitude Eisenhower won in a landslide in 1952. In any case there was a reason why Taft never got the nomination: from 1940 to 1952 there were always way too many doubts about his qualities as a candidate and his overall electability given his unwavering opposition to every aspect of the New Deal (most of which was very popular — hence Eisenhower’s statement about such critics’ “stupidity”).Then there was Thomas Dewey. In 1940 he was the District Attorney for New York County. He was a skilled prosecutor and had done sterling work. He had a well-deserved reputation for honesty, hard work, and competence. He also had no real political experience outside of New York City, and even there he was not actually involved in government. He was only 38 years old. Also, Dewey was notoriously stiff and cold in public appearances and generally unlikable. The saying went that while he was indeed a bit unlikable in public, once you got to know him in private, you came to detest him. Dewey did, however, more or less accept the New Deal, and he would go on to get the nomination in 1944 and 1948. By that time, however, he had been elected governor of New York (in 1942; to be re-elected in 1946 and 1950) and had proved that he was an excellent and highly competent administrator who could get out there and win elections. But in 1940 he was just a 38-year-old DA.Although Dewey was the early favourite, his youth and lack of experience told against him; and people turned more and more to one of the “dark horse” candidates: Wendell Willkie. Willkie had been an early supporter of the New Deal, but had soured on it in a long-running business dispute with the Tennesee Valley Authority. His dispute with the TVA attracted a great deal of attention; and Willkie proved a good speaker and an earnest, knowledgeable advocate — he was able to present telling, detailed criticisms of specific aspects of the New Deal (mostly the TVA and public utilities) in a convincing way without appearing to challenge all of it (in his campaign Willkie promised to keep the New Deal’s social programmes intact and actually pledged to expand Social Security — unlike Taft he was not an opponent of it in its entirety). Also, Willkie looked to be a better campaigner than either Taft or Dewey. Willkie was a fresh face besides — no connexion to the Hoovervilles and the crash.So the nod went to Willkie (despite his never having held elective office before), and Willkie barnstormed the country for the GOP. He did some excellent work rebuilding the Republican Party’s campaign organisation. The GOP was still extremely unpopular in large sections of the country, but Willkie braved hostile receptions, angry crowds, and occasional flung garbage — he campaigned indefatigably pretty much everywhere except in the “solid South” (though he did go to Texas). In many places he restored and revived the GOP at the local level. There were serious worries about the war in Europe during the campaign, and when Willkie began taking an anti-war stance in October, he actually went ahead of FDR in the polls. Willkie waged a tough, credible campaign, and FDR took him seriously. To take the wind out of Willkie’s sails FDR was finally driven to his famous pronouncement at Fenway Park as the campaign wound up: “I have said this before, but I shall say it again and again and again: your boys are not going to be sent into any foreign wars”. (The old man had not bothered to tell his advisors that he was going to say that in his peroration; but the old man’s instincts, as usual, were right — he pulled decisively ahead of Willkie in the campaign’s final days and won in another landslide.)So, the basic answer to your question is this: yes, the GOP took the election of 1940 very seriously indeed. It was a “rebuilding” election for the GOP, and Willkie not only did an excellent job at rebuilding the GOP at the grass roots level, but he also came astonishingly close to winning the election. The problem was, he was up against “the champion”, and “the champion” was always at his toughest in the home stretch. Anyway, it is doubtful that either Taft (never a great campaigner; too dead-set against the New Deal which was politically highly popular) or Dewey (too unlikable; too young) could have done any better than Willkie — if indeed they could have done as well. Dewey would take the old man on in 1944, and in the home stretch the old man beat him like a drum; and while Dewey would get a second chance in 1948, once again his opponent would beat him in the home stretch. Taft would never get the nod. Great legislator, but there it ended.",468,6,150,395,0,0

It was such an unpopular mistake that even modern Republicans disavow it. Indeed, I recall a certain Donald Trump castigating his presidential election opponent for voting for the war, and crowing that he’d opposed it (a lie, of course). When even the Republican President of 2018 thinks Bush was a major failure, the fault is less likely to be with the World Order and more with Bush.The second point is even funnier to dispatch, as the author of the article plaintively tries to plead it:It would be absurd, after all, to believe that the foreign policy of Barack Obama was uncontroversial with western allies simply because he carried himself in some dignified, agreeable matter (sic).But why? Is it so difficult to believe that the world respects a nation more when that nation elects a respectable leader?Or is it so surprising that, when a man projects himself as controversy personified (and his base elects him for it — counts it a qualification that he offends!), when the most technical way to describe his diplomatic philosophy is “madman theory”, that it becomes controversial to trust the nation he leads to ever keep its promises again?Indeed, here’s the lavish praise that the author himself heaps on the man he feels the world is unfair towards: “President Trump’s tariffs seem like broadly bad policy poorly imposed …” You recognise that about Trump and yet you think the world’s problem with him is that he’s a Republican? Go back to your safe space, conservative snowflake, and ponder the politically incorrect notion that it is wise not to trust a fool though he be a President, and stop taking it so personally — the facts, after all, trump your poor hurt Republican feelings.",749,16,2.8k,659,0,1

The other side of this coin, because our allies don’t believe in American Exceptionalism, is that supposed equals don’t like one person barking orders at the rest of the group and believe in consensus.The author seems to be asking why our allies don’t like us when we tell them what to do…and then just leaves it at that.

There’s also a lot of misdirected compassion, for “social safety nets”, and abhorrence of “let the poor die” as a national medical plan. Their comfort with authoritarianism makes it a lot easier for them to sweep the whole moral hazard taxation by coercion for social good thing under the couch where it doesn’t bother them, and thus become incrementally complicit in the end result, which effectively institutionalizes a 3rd way mixed economy that results in a governmental/industrial complex evolved far beyond Eisenhower’s nightmare of a military/industrial complex.The other thread I frequently encounter is on the subject of abortion, which is a topic I normally scrupulously do not discuss in public.

By contrast, I can’t think of a worthy Democratic candidate since Larry McDonald.In any case, whenever I fail to help worthy candidates like Goldwater or Paul to win GOP nomination (which is all-too-often), I can always vote third-party during general elections, and persuade others to do likewise. I appreciate third parties like the Libertarian Party and others for often providing worthy options whenever the GOP fails to do so.I know that other libertarians believe differently, and I respect their desire to leave the Republican Party to work within the Libertarian Party instead. Or within other worthy third parties, such as either the Constitution Party or the Independent American Party. Perhaps I’ll join them someday.On a related subject, third parties are innately hampered by our nation’s default voting system, which naturally encourages all political parties to consolidate into two major ones of roughly-equal strength, and renders it very challenging for any third parties to remain viable for more than rare fleeting moments in history.

So I went republican for a number of years even though I wasn’t totally on board with everything they stood for either-at least nothing they stood for was violating my fundamental core values (abortion). Over the last several years I’ve been very disappointed with the republican party because they are far too “big government” for me and are far less protective of our founding core principles than I’d like. So I’d call myself a conservative with libertarian leanings. I’m not pro drugs but I can value the concept of the federal government not being involved in determining whether drugs are legal. I think that should be left to the states. On that subject, I don’t think people should use drugs other than for medical issues. But I think it would be better if people just understood not to use drugs or have abortions than to have the government outlaw it.

Bill Clinton was elected without a mandate with only 43% of the vote and there was a split.In 2016 the libertarian candidate got 4% of the vote and the radical socialist got 1%. If the third party votes had gone to the candidates closest to their view point Donald Trump would have topped 50% and Hillary Clinton would have been over 49%. The popular vote would have gone to our president as the electoral vote would have also gone by an even bigger margin to President Trump. There would have been little or no controversy and the whine by democrats about the popular vote would have been viewed as just a whine by the losers.

There is a lot of that going on and it is being touted as policy, when in fact it is precisely what it sounds like—prostitution. 30 pieces of silver? They would take it in heartbeat and never look back.Nothing in life is free. Do you want a job that has a value that people will pay for? You need the skills that add that value. I teach at a University but I strongly disagree with the idea that everyone needs a college degree. In the community where I live, it is not unusual to wait for a month to get an electrician to come to your home. A carpenter? Forget it. Plumbers? A better shot. But when they step on to your property you better have at least $130.00. I don’t resent it—they went to trade school, acquired skills that have value to me and that I will trade my money for.Another misconception that politicians like to play with: companies create jobs. Wrong. Companies create wealth and more frequently than not they can increase their profit by using less of their revenue on jobs. Revenue is not profit. Their most important customer is not the end-user—it is their investors. They are in business to make money—not friends. Like Harry Truman said: you want a friend? Get a dog.Why can’t we export more of our products and subsequently create more jobs? Vacations, health care, codes, regulations, etc., aren't free. Those costs go into our products. People in other counties don’t give two hoots if you have health care or a vacation and they aren't going to pay for it. They do care if is product has lead in it or if it will electrocute them.

8,Why does the left lose?,U.S. Democrats,Right-Wing Politics,Left-Wing Politics,1!,1!,1!,"Thanks for the A2A.Others have suggested you might be trolling. I’m going to ignore their comments and answer in good faith.First of all, I don’t believe the left exists in the USA in any viable sense. The USA has two viable political parties (Democrats and Republicans obviously) and a few smaller parties (Green, Libertarian, Constitutional and Reform) as well as a plethora of parties on far right and far left as well as local parties that have no presence outside their home states. I would not consider any of these in any way viable.In comparison here in the UK, many members of the Conservative Party learn about electoral politics by volunteering for democratic or republican candidates in the USA. Both parties would be considered right wing in the UK.For a party that I would consider ‘left’ to win in the USA, it would have to replace one or other of the mainstream parties, probably the Democratic Party. This could happen but it takes a while for it to happen. By a while, I mean 5–10 electoral cycles, or 20–40 years. During this time, leftists would have to work together despite knowing that it’s going to take most of their political lives or more to achieve their objective.Let’s look at third parties since both the Democratic and Republican parties existed, ie from the 1856 election.1856, the Democratic Party beat the Republicans by 60 electoral votes while the ‘Know Nothings’ officially the American Party managed 8 (for Maryland). In the popular vote it was 45% to the Democrats, 33% to the Republicans and 21% to the Know Nothings. This hides what were in fact two separate contests. In the Free States, Republicans won 45%, Democrats 41% and Know Nothings 13% while in the slave states Democrats won 56%, Know Nothings 43% and Republicans almost none (and in ten of the fourteen slave states, they received no votes at all).Notice something here. Millard Fillmore of the American Party managed 43% of the popular vote in the slave states but only 8 electoral votes. This is part of the problem faced by third parties, the electoral system is such that third parties tend to be squeezed out until they reach a critical mass and become the first or second party.1860 4 parties achieved electoral votes: Republicans 180 electoral votes and 40% of the popular vote, Southern Democrats 72 electoral votes and 18% of the popular vote, Constitutional Union 39 electoral votes 13% of the popular vote and Northern Democrats 12 electoral votes, 29% of the popular vote. Here we see two things. Firstly, the Southern Democrats managed to get 6 times as many electoral votes as the Northern Democrats despite being well behind in the popular vote. Secondly, if the Democrats had not split, it’s likely that while they would take Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee from the Constitutional Union, they would still have lost the election despite polling 47% of the popular vote to the Republicans’ 40%.1880, Democrats beat Republicans by a mere 2000 votes in the popular vote, but Republicans won the election with 214 to 155 electoral votes. This shows us that it doesn’t just matter who gets the most votes nationally but where those votes are. It’s theoretically possible to win the election by winning 11 states (New Jersey, N.Carolina, Georgia, Michigan, Ohio, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Florida, New York, Texas and California) even with no votes in the other 39.1912 Theodore Roosevelt’s Progressive Party was the most viable third party since 1850. Unfortunately for them, they took all of their votes from the Republicans. In this election voting was: Democrats 435 electoral votes 42% of the popular vote; 88 Popular votes 27% of the popular vote; Republicans 8 electoral votes 23% of the popular vote; Socialists 0 electoral votes 6% of the popular vote.1924 this time, the Progressive Party took most of their votes from the Democratic Party… and the Democrats also lost votes to the GOP. The results were: Republican Party 382 EV (54%); Democratic Party 136 EV (29%); Progressive Party 13 EV (17%). So the issue here is, any third party needs to take votes equally from the two existing parties.1932, against the backdrop of the Depression, Democrat Franklin D Roosevelt wins a landslide both in terms of Popular Vote (57.4%) and the electoral vote (472–59) with the most left wing platform the Party had ever used. It’s still not left wing to British eyes but nevertheless, it shows that the left CAN win elections.There were similar results for 1936, 1940 and 1944 and then in 1948, with Roosevelt dead, his successor, Harry S Truman ran against Thomas E Dewey and despite the predictions in the polls that had Dewey a clear winner, and despite Strom Thurmond running as a Segregationist (Dixiecrat) due to Southern objections to the Civil Rights plank in the Democratic platform, Truman won. Results were: Democrats 303 EV (50%); Republicans 189 EV (45%); Dixiecrats 39 EV (2%). Note the Dixiecrats total of 39 Electoral Votes with only 2% of the national vote, same as the Progressives who got none.1960 shows another issue with the electoral system. Even if the Democrats choose a candidate like Kennedy, unpledged or faithless voters for the same party can end up voting for a different candidate. Harry Byrd with less than 0.5% of the vote received 15 electoral votes (14 unpledged voters from Alabama and Mississippi and one faithless voter from Oklahoma).The most successful third party candidate since then was the right wing American Party of George Wallace and Curtis Le May who achieved 46 electoral votes (13% of the popular vote) in 1968. Once again, the third party votes were in the Old South.One more third party candidate, Ross Perot of the Reform Party, managed almost 20% of the popular vote in 1992 and 8% in 1996 but no electoral votes.In 2000 the vote was between Al Gore and George W Bush and was decided by Florida, which Bush won by 537 votes. It has often been said by Democrats that Ralph Nader (the Green Candidate with 2.5% of the popular vote nationally) cost Al Gore the election, but the truth is, Bush won Florida by such a small margin that not only Nader but Pat Buchanan in fourth or Harry Browne in fifth could have made the difference. Even the 1000-odd wannabe Democratic voters in Dade County who claimed to have voted for Buchanan by mistake because they couldn’t understand the voting machines could have made the difference.Then we come onto 2016 renowned as the election in which more candidates than any other got electoral votes since around 1800 (this was due to faithless voters). Clinton Electors voted for Colin Powell (3), Bernie Saunders and Faith Spotted Eagle while Trump electors voted for John Kasich and Ron Paul, for a total of 7 different candidates getting electoral votes.So for ‘the Left’ to win a US election they have to either find a candidate who can win one of the other parties (Republicans is probably easier because at least they don’t have “Super Delegates” in case the American Public vote the ‘wrong way’). Next they have to ensure that the people who vote for them live in the right areas so they can get electoral votes. Thirdly, they have to make sure their electors vote the right way.Alternatively, they have to form a third party, work themselves to death for forty years to break the duopoly and keep on working together to win elections.Unfortunately, the left does not work together because: (a) they’re all purists and believe that anyone disagreeing with them is evil so they end up breaking up over supporting the wrong side in Syria or something; and (b) electoral work is boring so they go off and try to make stuff happen in other ways like protests and lobbying the congressmen they already have etc. Thing is, b may not win elections but it gets stuff done a lot more quickly than trying to form a party and take over Congress.",189,3,80,403,0,0

Why, then was nearly every celebrity elected, in the present and the past, a Republican?Two reasons:You have a far too small sample size to generalize.Celebrities, in general, don’t want to run for office, they want to continue with their careers.The most prominent example, of course, is Ronald Reagan. He was a Hollywood movie star who ran for president in 1980, and won. That seems to prove your theory.But dig a bit deeper. Reagan’s movie career essentially ended in the late 1940s, when he was in his late 30s. He ran for governor in 1966, when he was 55; he ran for president in 1976 (and lost the nomination) when he was 65; and he ran for president successfully in 1980, when he was 69. In other words, he was already up in years when he ran for governor, and he was a Golden Ager when he was elected president. Reagan was originally a Democrat, and his views slowly drifted to the right as he aged.Similarly:Donald Trump, who also started out as a Democrat (and who’s more like a C-list celebrity) was elected when he was 70 (breaking Reagan’s age record).Clint Eastwood was close to 60 when elected mayor of Carmel, CA — a nonpartisan office in a town with a population of around 3,600.In other words, these and other celebrities who ran for office or held public office (e.g. Sonny Bono, Shirley Temple, etc.) ran or held office after their celebrity careers were over.",76,2,139,"1,286",0,0

I’ve seen xenophobic slogans plastered on public transport along the lines of “Mexico para los mexicanos! Fuera los extranjeros!”But I would put it at about the level of Germany and far less than in Australia or the US.Of the black people I knew in Mexico, one was I think from Haiti and now lived and ran a tiny business in Mexico City, one was a middle aged African American expat, one was Nigerian who had lived in Europe and spoke native level English with a London accent, one was Kenyan who had lived in the US and spoke almost native level English with an American accent, and one was English with I think Jamaican heritage.Of those, only the Nigerian found Mexicans to be racist to her. And this was mainly because of strangers staring and pointing. None of my other black friends reacted as badly to this as she did. My interpretation was that it wasn’t racism but a combination of ignorance and curiosity. There are black Mexicans but they’re in small isolated poor communities mostly, like Chacahua in Oaxaca. So to your average Mexcian from a big city black people are still pretty exotic. I knew a handful of white people in China who reacted the same way to the same kind of attention from Chinese people.So, overall, I wouldn’t say that there is much if any specific anti-black racism that Mexican immigrants to the US are bringing with them, whether they’re illiterate or illegal or not.If they bring some biases with them about African American people it’s likely based on what they’ve been exposed to in movies and TV.

It did find that 52% of Republicans agreed with the sentiment. That’s a lot. Disappointing, really, but the basic answer to your question is, truthfully, “they don’t support cancelling the election.”But that’s a bit of a cop-out, so I won’t stop there. Let’s look at the question that you should have asked: why do 52% of Republicans agree with allowing President Trump to unconstitutionally delay the 2020 election?If you read this article at The Atlantic, it gives a few answers. Read fully and you’ll find another poll, equally troubling, that gives deeper insight.If you want a poll that asks people specifically about cancelling, rather than delaying, an election, the Atlantic points to one taken in the summer of 2016. In that one 67% of Democrats polled wanted to cancel the 2016 election and just give Obama a third term. Another 6% were undecided. Majority of Democrats want third term for ObamaNo matter what party you belong to it’s easy to see that both of these schemes are… what’s the technical term here? Bonkers? You Don’t Do That. You Can’t Do Any Of That. Don’t. Even. Try.So why is it that 52% of Republicans and 67% of Democrats are so quick to put the Constitution through the shredder when it suits them?

Larger fractions believe that millions of illegal immigrants voted (68 percent) and that voter fraud happens somewhat or very often (73 percent). Again, this is similar to previous polls.Moreover, 52 percent said that they would support postponing the 2020 election, and 56 percent said they would do so if both Trump and Republicans in Congress proposed this.Not surprisingly, beliefs about the 2016 election and voter fraud were correlated with support for postponement. People who believed that Trump won the popular vote, that there were millions of illegal votes in 2016, or that voter fraud is not rare were more likely to support postponing the election. This support was also more prevalent among Republicans who were younger, were less educated, had less factual knowledge of politics and strongly identified with the party.Now, this was from last August. I’d like to have newer data to work with. But here’s what I think a big part of the reason is. Let’s call it the “fuck your feelings” effect. There is now a big part of the Republican party who I believe will respond to any poll question in whatever way they think will annoy people who aren’t Republicans. They don’t really believe that millions of illegals vote. They don’t care whether that’s true. They only care that (they think) saying so will annoy liberals.For more of it, and in a more disturbing location, check out this article from The Atlantic. A “senior White House official with direct access to the President” told the author,“The Trump Doctrine is ‘We’re America, Bitch.’ That’s the Trump Doctrine.”It’s not a coherent ideology in the sense that anyone used to normal politics would recognize. It’s bullying as ideology. And it rewards the sort of tribalism that results in people doing everything based on what they think will own the libs.In a bizarre way, it’s exactly what people originally meant when they coined the term “politically correct” - doing something not because you honestly believed it, but because it sent the right political signals.",145,5,538,"4,373",0,3

He would have performed better with minorities, especially Hispanics. He would have spoken better, and been less easy to dismiss as an uninformed and inexperienced buffoon.He would probably not have connected as well with blue-collar families in the rust belt.He would probably have won the popular vote, since he would have performed better than Trump did in huge states such as Florida, California, Texas and New York. But that would not have affected the outcome in any of those states, since Trump won both Florida and Texas and was not remotely close in California or New York.Trump won Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin. If Cruz underperformed him in these states he could potentially have lost the Electoral College despite winning the popular vote. Ohio was the only state which Trump won comfortably.If you move PA, MI and Wi into the Democratic column, leaving other states as they were, then Clinton would have narrowly won.So what states might Cruz have picked up that Trump did not? I don’t see Virginia or Minnesota being much different.That means it would be down to three states where Cruz’s ability to campaign in Spanish and his lack of outright hostility to Spanish speakers might have helped him, relative to Trump: Colorado, Nevada and New Mexico.

4,If Israel was a US state would it vote Republican or Democrat?,Democratic Party vs. Republican Party,Voting,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Hard to say. It is quite likely to be split, more or less along the current lines of Center-left vs. right.What makes is complicated is the fact that enlightened people tend to support noble human and humane values. We support democracy. Equality, fraternity and liberty. But these noble ideas are NOT really effective when there are difficult existential problems to be solved. For Israel, security and standing up to the many people who would actually like to kill us, forces our concern for others to be tempered by necessary security actions: if a Palestinian wishes to travel in a problematic area under our MILITARY control, he will have to undergo a security check, which is inconvenient and degrading, because he or his neighbor MIGHT be carrying bombs to kill innocents.This is how it begins. It also evolves: observers who are NOT acquainted with all the details, or who have already judged and are only trying to prove their existing AGENDA, will start claiming that the roadblocks are NOT a real necessity, they reflect evil intention by Israel. And the Israelis will start believing that ALL Palestinians have evil intention too. And the RESULT of this friction will be to persuade MORE people on BOTH sides that their belief of the evil of the other side is true, while actually causing a self-fulfilling prophesy - people WILL start behaving more badly.SO: Many Israelis support Trump, because of his actions regarding dealing with enemies, and because he really calls a spade a spade. (Many Americans seem to hate him because he calls a spade a dirty, bloody, damned spade). I think many Israelis see the same hatred directed at Trump as we see directed at us - often, because of prejudice, or pure dislike, and accompanied by false narratives to demonize him, as false narratives are used against us to demonize us.When trump pulled out of the Paris agreement - many said he is not trying to save the planet - and he actually said the Paris deal was bad because IT did NOT stop CO2 emissions, but would cost the USA billions anyway. (The USA has DONE what the Paris accord suggests be done - limit carbon emissions). When he spoke harshly to NATO, the Europeans said he is no longer their ally - but he was only asking the richest European country to pay the 2% GNP fee NATO requires, instead of depending on the USA to foot their bill. When he left the Iran deal, hysterical accusations were made that he is prepared for WAR - when in fact he said a BETTER DEAL was required, that would REALLY stop war. The Iran deal ALLOWS them to openly make bombs in 7 years time, and to clandestinely continue their plans in their military bases, where inspection is forbidden and where recent proof has emerged they HAD genuine secret weapons programs going on. Almost EVERYTHING Trump does becomes twisted and demonized - but when you look coolly at the facts (not the style) he really appears to be doing the right, honest, decent, honorable and courageous thing every time. And Israel ? Same for us. Israel for example gives sick children from Syria, Gaza and all the surrounding Arab countries free medical aid - and is accused of stealing their organs. We supply Gaza with all its food, water, electricity and gas - but because we limit military supplies to Hamas, everybody says Israel is starving the Gazans. So - Trump and Israel are common victims of mass hysterical hatred and horrible, cynical, twisted lies.So the reality moves us to admire and appreciate Trump, while our sentiments drive us to cling to noble, lofty ideals.",52,0,21,178,0,0

2,Why do Republican (Red) states have the highest suicide rates in the country?,Suicide Rate,Demographics,Republican Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,"I am not sure that the linked article backs up the premise of the question, but here are some factors.Red states tend to be more rural. Rural areas have higher suicide rates in the US.Red states have had a lot of poverty and economic difficulties, particularly in recent years. In some cases, the reason that they are Red states is because these drastic changes occurring when they were Blue states. In any case, economic downturn and poverty are associated with increased suicide rates.In the US whites have a higher suicide rate than blacks. No one knows exactly why that is, but Red states tend to have a higher white population.There is a correlation between suicide rate and gun ownership rates. In fact, this correlation accounts for most of the association between gun ownership rates and gun violence overall (many high gun ownership rate states have among the lowest gun homicide rates, even lower than in Europe). Rural areas have much higher gun ownership rates, and tend to be in Red states.If the article is correct that mental health care delivery is a major factor in suicide rate, then poor rural areas, which are disproportionately in Red states, do have some of the biggest challenges in getting adequate mental health care for their populations, would be expected to have higher suicide rates.The linked article does not make a Red/Blue State correlation with suicide rate, so I have to wonder why the question. In the US billions of dollars are regularly spent trying to convince people of Red/Blue differences in the form of political campaigns. For many people, these partisan arguments lead to biases where they assume that political party affiliation of political leaders is an important aspect of the socio-economic conditions of that state. In some cases, that may be correct, but often it is a red herring. I would not accept any such asserted connection without good evidence, something much stronger than casual association.Also, in many cases correlation of dominant political party and differences in characteristics of states is due more to the choices of political parties than their direct effect on policies. For example, the Democrats have been concentrating their efforts on large urban areas for decades, and essentially abandoned the Southeast and rural America. This doesn’t mean the poverty in those regions have to do with political party choices of voters. The Southest was far poorer when ruled by Democrsts and Republicans have governed over a period of very high economic expansion and population growth. Judging who gets credit or blame for these changes in conditions is complicated, to say the least, and party domination may often be the result, not cause, of a lot of socio-economic factors.",71,3,201,758,0,0

4,"What does it mean to be a ""member"" of the Democratic or Republican Parties in the US?",Democratic Party vs. Republican Party,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"The meaning of “member” varies from state to state, from party to party within a state, and from person to person within the same party. Most voters consider a person who votes in a party primary to be a member of that party.But others broaden it to include those who have declared a party at registration (in states where that occurs) regardless of whether they show up to vote or not.Most who do not accept the above definitions try to narrow the definition. Most narrow definitions involve money. If you pay for a membership, then you are a member. Here in GA the lowest level of party membership is the precinct caucus. I was the only one to show up from my precinct for the Republican party. And I voted Republican in the 2014 Republican primary.I paid good money to attend the precinct caucus, then more money to attend the 5th district caucus and the County caucus. But in the eyes of the guy who collected that money every time, the same guy, who also collects the money to attend state party events, and to become a member. Despite getting money from me at least 7 times 2014–2017 the man who collects the money, and keeps the list of who is and is not a member, does not consider me a member.I personally object to a political party being so obsessed with money. My observation is that volunteers not motivated by money are worth far more in politics than the money, which is seldom spent wisely.On the other hand, national party organizations, both R and D, repeatedly send me emails calling me a member in good standing who will lose my membership if I don’t send them more money. Of course, I have never sent them money in the first place. The whole thing by both R and D is such a scam.The LP party gave up on me many years ago in IL. They have not contacted me in GA, although I have exchanged phone numbers and email with many of their members.The GA Constitution Party considers me a friend and invites me to their Saturday teleconferences. They never ask for money. I don’t think they consider me a member, just a friend.Bottom line, “member” means so many different things to so many different people, and even the same person finds it convenient to change the meaning to suit the situation.When I was in IL, the same thing was true with both the R and D parties.

It is trivial to change at any time.However, the parties are still private institutions even though the Big Two are effectively the entire Government. So they make up their own rules. Each major party has a national level and state parties as well. In some places, one is not allowed to vote in a primary unless one is already registered some length of time in advance. In other places, people can simply mark their change at the time they go to vote.The DNC and RNC (national committees) are I presume corporations that have funds, can hire staff, and so on.I think to be an “active member” of the party, some would say they simply have to vote. Others would say that they should be contributing funds. Others would say they have to be employed by the party, or be working/volunteering for them. Others might say it refers to the politicians themselves—people who hold government offices, whether by election or by appointment.",77,2,347,"1,385",0,0

Sense8, while critically acclaimed and possessed of a fanatical core audience, never quite reached the level of mass appeal that would have led Netflix to prioritize it over other projects.They had not considered the intensity of the core audience’s response to cancellation.

We get brave heroes instead of scared little wabbits.They had the tools to be a Mission Impossible/A Team type of force that allowed one or two people to have a ridiculously large skill set and use innovative ways to succeed.They desperately needed to get them together and shut down a lot of the extraneous story lines and many of the exotic locations.

I love Babylon 5 and was excited to see what J. Michael Straczynski could bring to the show. The Wachowskis have an interesting creative style that can be fantastic (Matrix) and other times does not work (Jupiter Ascending, Matrix 3).

Game of Thrones, for reference, costs 10-ish million per episode. The difference, however, is that Sense8 is a niche show that I have to explain every time I want to talk about it. Game of Thrones is one of the most popular TV shows airing.Sense8, at its core, was a show about love. It showed very explicit love between men, women, and masses of people to the point that you couldn’t tell which limbs belonged to whom. It featured a trans woman playing a trans woman, interracial love and acceptance, and one of the most diverse casts ever.It was the show that made me brave enough come out. It never turned away from political statements, and stood up to stigma across all fronts. I believe BPO is a metaphor for everyone who has ever made someone feel unwelcome because of who they are.My point is, if you could distill every wonderful value in the world down into one show, it would look pretty close to Sense8. There is plenty in there for moralizing bigots to dislike, and the show itself took the concepts of transphobia and homophobia and even ‘male narratives’ to task.At its core, Sense8 was a quirky, beautiful, boundary-smashing, radiant TV show that cost an absurd amount of money to film.

I liked the series’ execution and concept, and loved the Wachowski’s style, but it seemed to me to morph pretty quickly from a serious and interesting SF series aimed at anyone with an open mind (first half of series 1) to a very silly polemic aimed exclusively at a minority audience of activists who share the Wachowskis political views thereafter.",409,8,1.1k,"2,141",0,1
2,Did Sense8 get cancelled because of conservatives?,Sense8 (TV series),Conservatism (politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"I agree with most of the answers here, but my answer is actually yes. I’ll explain.First let me say that I’m a fan of the show. I’m not conservative, but I frequently get called that anyway. And the show was good, except it was a little bit too LBGTQ+ “friendly” in my opinion.And I support equal rights. I don’t think people should be harassed, threatened, or denied jobs just because of what they do in the bedroom. Or who they love or how they dress or even what gender they say they are. I hate the people that are angry or violent towards LGBT people. Those people are just despicable in my opinion. However, Sense8 wasn’t just LGBTQ+ friendly. It was also rather hostile towards gender norms.Ok, so Sense8 has 8 main stars. There’s Capheus Onyango a Nigerian bus driver, Sun Bak, a korean kickboxer, Nomi Marks, a trans woman political activist & hacker, Kala Dandekar, an Indian chemist, Riley Blue, an Icelandic DJ, Wolfgang Bogdanow, a Russian safe-cracker involved in organized crime, Lito Rodriguez, a closeted gay actor in Mexico, & Will Gorski, a Chicago cop.So out of the 8 we have a transwoman who is a lesbian & a gay actor. So that’s just 1/4 of the crew that’s LGBTQ+ right? So what’s the problem? Are people really so sensitive that just two non-heterosexual characters would turn people away from the show? Well, there probably are some people like that, it’s a big country. But no, that’s not what I’m saying. You have to look deeper and see how relationships played out for the different characters.Starting from the top. Capheus didn’t have a love interest at all until some point in the second season. Sun is the same. Nomi is in a very happy relationship with her lesbian girlfriend. Kala is engaged to be married, but doesn’t love him. Riley is single at first but falls in love with Will. Wolfgang starts out single, but falls in love with Kala. And Lito is horribly unhappy until he comes out of the closet and admits he’s gay. At which point his relationship becomes nearly perfect.The Riley/Will relationship is a good one to look at. It’s basically the only “straight” relationship in the show that has any measure of happiness. It becomes quickly obvious that these two are heavily in love, but unfortunately they are separated by thousands of miles. But then they meet! Awesome! Now they can be hap… oh… Will now has to take heavy amounts of drugs because of plot reasons? So… now the only happy heterosexual couple isn’t happy either? Well damn.Compare that to Lito though. He was in a homosexual relationship and he was also in a “fake” heterosexual relationship. He was miserable. The lies were creating problems between him & his boyfriend, and it was wearing him down. So he finally admits to being gay, and the media crucifies him. But he quickly refinds love with his boyfriend and the woman that moved in with them. Who usually doesn’t join them in sex, but sometimes does .Oh, I almost forgot. Remember how I said only 2 of the 8 were LGBT? Well, that’s sort of a lie. I’ll explain, because if you haven’t watched the show it won’t make sense.So the sensates (the 8 stars) are all connected with each other. They can talk to each other, they can feel the sensations they feel, they can see and hear through them, and they can even control each other’s bodies and access their knowledge. So while Wolfgang is the one who can crack safes, Kala could be standing in front of a safe and just let him “take over” and crack it, even if they are thousands of miles apart.And this show loved their sex scenes. It was rarely just one sex scene going on. It was usually multiple, if not all of them. And they would mix and match the footage so that each character would be showing up at each location and they would intermingle. It was only a few episodes into the first season where the “straight” characters would get involved with what were basically giant orgies. Where they’d be kissing and touching whoever happened to be nearest.So we got to see Will kissing Lito or Capheus kissing Wolfgang. To me it disrespected those characters. It made heterosexuality out to be lesser choice. Basically saying that everyone is secretly bi-sexual, if we’d just get over our hangups.Here’s the thing. I am straight. However, I’m also far outside the boundaries of normal sexuality. I’m both poly and a sadist. Neither of those things are “normal”, but they are normal for me. For me those both represent ideal sexuality. But I don’t think it’s for everyone. I just think it’s for me. I don’t laugh at people who are monogamous. I don’t tell them that my way is better. I just say that their way is not for me.And Sense8 seems to do the opposite in my opinion. All 8 of them are basically now into poly. Because none of them have sex with only their partner. I will say that by the end of the second season the relationships had changed.Capheus meets a woman and falls in love. Sun meets a man and falls in love.Nomi marries her girlfriend in Paris.Kala marries her husband because she lives in India, but in the finale Wolfgang gets accepted into the relationship. She basically loves them both.Riley & Will are happily in love.Lito is happy with his boyfriend and they both love their girlfriend.Granted, in the last episode they did fix a bit of their straight is bad philosophy. But only sort of. Because of course they had to have one big huge final orgy.It’s not that it was a bad show, it’s just that there was too much of the above in the show. You could take some of that out and you’d have more time for plot or, even better, some action.I don’t think conservatives boycotted it or anything like that. I just think that the amount of LGBTQ content in it was enough to push a lot of people away from the show. The show was basically made for the LGBTQ crowd, but the cost was far beyond that. The only way that show could have been successful is if it was for everyone, instead of a very small minority.",1.5k,13,3.4k,"3,907",0,0
2,Did Sense8 get cancelled because of conservatives?,Sense8 (TV series),Conservatism (politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"No. There may have been some viewers who were turned off by some of the subject matter and content, but I don’t think there was a boycott.Sense8 was cancelled because it cost a lot to make and not enough people decided to watch it, which is a pity, but understandable.The first season was marketed badly. It was presented as a sci-fi action spectacle like the Wachowskis used to make. It was sold as the Matrix with nudity and the opening scene suggested there was going to be a lot of guns and action and weirdness ahead… and then we spent a lot of time watching a gay movie star being outed, a transgender hacker dealing with prejudice and a nice Indian girl struggling with her love life. People were confused and disappointed.The action did come and the final hour was among the most exciting hours of TV I’ve ever seen, but a lot of people had lost patience with it long before then. It struggled to find an audience. Those who stuck with it were rewarded and many discovered that they genuinely cared about the characters struggles.While season one felt like it was driving towards something interesting, season two felt like it was drifting around looking for direction. It didn’t help that everyone’s favourite character had to be recast and one of the creators had to take some personal time. A lot of people who had been talking up season one were disappointed to find there was a real dip in quality in year two.Netflix might have stayed with it if word of mouth justified the expense, but it was clear that the show wasn’t going to pick up any new viewers and was shedding some that it already had.

Nor are boycotts generaly effective, because those that do enjoy the content of something generally do not care if someone else objects to that same content.

2,What would be the effects of Trump's trade war in the midterm elections? Would it help the GOP or hurt them?,2018 Midterm Elections in the United States,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Likely it would help. Trump (and the Republicans) will be portrayed as standing up for American workers, farmers, companies, etc. in pushing back against unfair and onerous tariffs placed by other nations on American products. The massive trade deficits he rails about are real. The insanity of the mainstream media coverage is that the media (for years) has ho-hummed the trade issue. They never seemed to question why. Why weren’t they questioning the political class on why we have such one sided imbalances with almost every other nation? We saw the same syndrome on the issue of NATO. Several nation’s were skating, not paying their agreed 2% of GDP. Initially the media outcry was Trump wants to dissolve NATO. Ultimately he got the nations to pay their share. Why wasn’t the media raising that issue previously with Congress? They love to ask questions, but mostly the gotcha type. What Trump has done is shake the lethargy out of the status quo. He’s asking questions and getting this response out of many, “You know, I never thought about that, he’s right.” And with the country’s economy booming the Democrats have a hard sale to make. Pelosi’s denigration of the tax cuts and the historically low unemployment numbers won’t help either.

2,What would “inner cities” and poor urban neighborhoods be like if they were governed by republicans?,Inner Cities,Liberals,Minorities,1!,1!,1!,"Pretty much as they are now, only with different leaders.The problem with ‘inner cities’, (a euphemism for ghetto, etc,) is that the people who live in them are often people who have been subjected to mistreatment and discrimination, and, once they fall into that rut, they don’t attempt to pull themselves out. And why would they do that? Well, if you are getting your needs met without working for it, why would you work?It is commonly called welfare, but, in ancient Rome they called it ‘bread and circuses,’ meaning that, as long as the Emperors and politicians kept the common man appeased and fed, and entertained, things could just keep going the way they were, without effort, and a small amount of money paid out.Another point is that those who live in those areas, for the most part, are not there willingly. Economic reasons keep people in areas they would rather leave, and, since they don’t really want to be there, they have no pride of place.If a person is drawing food stamps, and other government ‘assistance,’ they may feel no desire to change how they live. Everybody knows that if they want to, they can find a way to change food stamps or other such assistance into hard cash, enabling them to buy things other than food, such as drugs, fancy phones, cars, etc. I’ve seen it done, so, I know it happens from personal experience.As for government subsidized housing? Well, look at it from the outside, landlords aren’t interested in making changes to make the houses more like homes, because they would have to spend the money they receive and that would not be profitable to them. I think that, in places where the houses/apartments, whatever, exist, the owners should have to live there for something like a month out of each year, and, if multiple properties are owned, then one month for each. It might not make much difference, but, I would suggest during the hot season and the cold season, so they would get the full effect of their neglect.Once the ‘victims’ of this kind of beneficial ‘kindness’ of the government sink into the level of apathy that will keep them ‘happy’, then changes are rarely made by the powers that be, and it doesn’t matter the political affiliations of those in power because the ‘victims’ will see that they are getting what they want, regardless of who is in power.I wish it was different, but, unless there are some fundamental changes made to the system, nothing else will change.Back in the 1990s, when I was receiving government assistance, there was the program of having to apply for work, and to provide papers from prospective employers showing that you were making an effort to get off assistance by taking care of your own needs. It never really worked because guess what? People can fake those signatures and contacts. There was also a move afoot to restrict the number of dependents one could ‘produce’ in order to increase the amount of assistance being received, again, why work if you could just pop out another child to keep the numbers high, and thus increase your allotments from the government?As long as living off of the government is ‘easier’ than working for a living, you will always have a class of people who are willing to sit at home and take the easy way out.Now, I am not saying that those who have worked, and paid into the system should not be ‘given’ what they need, but, too often, that cuss word gets bandied about, you know, ‘entitlements’? Well, I paid into social security all of my working life, and therefore, I AM entitled to what I receive. And, if the people in DC would pay back what they have ‘borrowed’ from the funds, SS would be self-sustaining.

How different are the present circumstances, and why?",Democratic Party vs. Republican Party,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"The circumstances are different.For one, these are two totally different eras. Assuming we are talking about the Infamous McCarthy and not one of the others, he was operating at the very height of the Cold War.Mccarthy was also an ass and President Eisenhower was simply biding his time to drop the rhetorical hammer on him.This was also an era where Presidents were grudgingly supported by the opposition regarding all external issues, no matter how contentious individual relationships were. If MCarthy had called Ike a traitor, he would have been blasted by both parties in unison. Then again that was Ike.That was a very different Republican Party. That party would have recoiled at the hypothetical proposed here.The G7 didn’t exist then. Europe was still in its postwar reconstruction and the familial bonds between the US and Canada were as yet immature.This is much different today. The G7 today are operationally the partners of American postwar hegemony. We call American Presidents, the Leader of the Free World and the Most Powerful Man in the World because of the relationships involved in this particular alliance. By crapping on the G7, President Trump erodes his own international power base.There currently is no analogue to McCarthy and their has never before been an analogue to Trump. They get compared at times but McCarthy never wielded the Power of a modern President and Trump lacks the endurance of McCarthy.With regards to the G7, there is another difference as well. During the “Red Scare” Congress seemed paralyzed to cope with McCarthy, both parties mind you, and President Eisenhower was carefull to mind his step until the insanity reached a certain pitch. The modern Republicans are at a loss on how to cope with Trump, generally, but enacting Trade Wars with allies while giving cover to Chinese State Run Companies involved in domestic espionage and weak Russian policy gets them agitated.They are treading carefully because they hope for a peaceful solution on the Korean Peninsula but the collapse of the G7 carries real and immediate consequences at home in the districts.So, in short; This is New.We haven’t seen this before.",217,4,275,"1,377",0,0

That paranoia still exists today and is creating very unstable conditions between nations.McCarthy started the purge and Trueman enhanced it by putting everyone on notice that even the suggestion of a fascist or communist affiliation would destroy them.I am not sure how NK fits into the question but what it seems to boil down to, is the US needs a boogieman to keep the home fires and fears burning to justify endless war and a badly bloated dominating military complex.I don’t know that things are any different, the boogieman today is a “Terrorist” instead of a “Communist” .

1,Which Republican president's foreign policy do you most closely agree with in retrospect?,Foreign Policy,Foreign Policy of the United States of America,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Well, there is Teddy Roosevelt, Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. Each of the four had their successes: Roosevelt in mediating the Russo-Japanese war and getting the Panama Canal built (by highly dubious means…), Eisenhower in meeting the rise of the Soviet Union and establishing the US as the unquestioned leader of the free world after the end of WWII. Richard Nixon in the opening with China, and Reagan in working to accelerate the decline of the Soviet Union. Of the 4 mentioned above, I would probably rate Teddy Roosevelt the highest. All Presidents of the United States since the beginning of the 20th century led a nation that got increasingly drunk with its ultimately unchallengeable power. So there were elements of crude bullying that each were responsible for that tarnish their legacies. Teddy Roosevelt essentially assisted the coup that overthrew Columbian control of Panama after Colombia refused to agree to terms of a treaty, and conveniently had American warships on the beach just after the US backed coup occurred to solidify the gain, and then imposed a treaty on Panama that gave us 99 year control over the canal. Eisenhower’s CIA was actively involved in the overthrow of governments not friendly enough to American corporate interests in Latin America, creating what became known as Banana Republics controlled by ruthless dictators that brutally oppressed their own people. Reagan helped to accelerate the ultimate crumbling of the USSR by creating massive military budgets in America that helped bankrupt the 3rd world economy of the USSR. But he was also responsible for the blatant violation of law in the Iran-Contra Affair in which he created an off-the-shelf covert operation that illegally sold weapons to Iran and used the profits to fund the Contras to destabilize the Sandinista’s in Nicaragua in violation of the Bolland Amendment.On balance, I feel that Teddy Roosevelt’s was the most defensible foreign policy given that America at the time of his Presidency was emerging as a global power and we were feeling our way in the hemisphere that we saw as our own to dominate. We’d asserted it much earlier in the Monroe Doctrine at a time when much of the old world was too busy with their own internal and hemispherical conflicts to challenge us. Much of what he did I see arose out of his own aggressive and bullish nature as we elbowed our way into a very competitive global environment. He was very idealistic, had a strong sense of empathy for underdogs, and felt justified in asserting his/our power in a world of bullies. Each of the other Republican Presidents led a more mature nation, more cynical, more ideologically driven in a bi-polar global situation after WWII, where we defined our nation in terms of facing an ideologically hostile and aggressive (though far weaker than we ever admitted) power determined to challenge American supremacy.",45,0,18,341,0,0

As long as the Soviets were committed to calling our bet and raising our “hand”, as they’d been since the end of WWII, we would eventually win the game. Why?Two master poker players sit in a room at a table, skills being equally matched. Each has been replaced over time by an equally skilled player when necessary, and the game has been going on for decades.One player has, beyond the door behind him, a roomful of cash. But that is all the money he has. If the room is ever emptied, he is done, because he can gain no credit. So the room has been becoming slowly more empty over time: The Soviets.The other player has no door behind him. In his pocket though, he has a credit card with an infinite credit line behind it; US Treasury Bills: The Americans.Both “teams” being equal at the game, which one has the best chance of winning, given enough time?Reagan recognized that he was merely the current American player at the “Can you top this?” game of competitive military proliferation between us and the Soviets. He knew they had very little credit available; too many of their “satellite” countries were actually depending on them for credit.We on the other hand, with our excellent credit, could simply keep borrowing at seemingly an infinite pace. As we did, first from the Japanese mainly, and then the Chinese.Borrowed the money and put as much of it into new weapons development as it took to keep the Soviets starving their own economy to try & keep up.The point wasn’t that we would have any set of multiple weapons that they couldn’t copy or defend against. We only needed one of them to work; a better ICBM they couldn’t stop, or a better ICBM defense, they couldn’t counter. To ensure we had always a credible threat, multiple programs were underway at all times.Reagan went “all in” during his term, and it worked. One system, the MX “Peacekeeper” ICBM (Which I worked on.) did get completed and tested during his tenure, and another, the “MTHEL” anti-ballistic lazer, was proven by the Israeli’s soon after.So the Russians had no choice whatsoever. As fantastical as some of our projects appeared, they knew we were serious, and one day they would discover that they had permanently lost, the “Cold War”.

1,How do Democrats and Republicans (generally) differ on the main issue of illegal aliens living/working in the United States?,Undocumented Immigrants,Illegal Immigration,1!,1!,1!,1!,"In very general terms. Democrats see the influx of illegal aliens as people coming from countries with troubled economies and high levels of violence and disorder who want to work in America and who provide needed labor for jobs Americans are not interested in filling. Stoop labor is overwhelmingly done by transient immigrant labor, as is much construction labor, and despite what some Conservatives like to say, they are not taking American jobs from American citizens. Every time there is a crackdown on illegal immigration in America it sends agricultural and the construction trades into a panic as they lose laborers they cannot replace. I am a Residential General Contractor in Washington state and Mexican labor is a huge part of the framing and sheetrock trades, and of course in the agricultural sector we are huge producers of wheat, apples and other produce. And our state, like the entire nation is desperately short of people willing or able to take those jobs.Republicans typically see this as a legal issue. If people come here illegally they should be rounded up and sent home because, well, they came here illegally. Though it is not the entire reason for their stridency around the issue, racism most certainly plays a part. Illegals are seen as people who live on the fringes on American society and are largely unassimilable into American culture. And they play up every single case of an illegal who commits a crime to tar all immigrants as criminals and ne’er do wells. Trump certainly gave this a huge boost when he said Mexican illegals were rapists and murderers, though adding parenthetically that some of them were probably good people. And his base ate it up. Polling has shown that a majority of Trump’s supporters (and he is, after all now the leader of the Republican Party) fear the “browning” of America and see the supremacy of White culture under assault.",27,0,18,341,0,0

By omission, it gave those with a legal status a pass. That is most significantly seen in the opposition to illegals voting, which gave the impression that it was OK for those with legal status to vote. This new populist strain is not ideological. It makes no attempt to be logically consistent. How long it can maintain prominence is not certain.The modern version of the traditional Republican position is this:Government action towards immigrants should focus on the undesirables, the bad.Focus on terrorist sympathizers. Nobody should be in the US who does not agree with the American understanding of the Declaration of Independence and the US Constitution. Immigrants who want to create unAmerican sub-communities are not welcome.Focus on murderers, rapists, DUI drivers. I draw the line between DUI drivers and speeders. Others draw the line elsewhere.

BNBR applies to everyone. Quora once dinged me when I violated the BNBR policy by saying something particularly vulgar and nasty about Trump.However Quora certainly supports its users giving honest political opinions in their answers, even if such opinions are very, very negative — as long as they aren't vulgar.Answers that include opinions on political issues will not be removed on Quora unless they are overtly racist or bigoted against a certain gender or religion (or against a lack of religious belief) — or really vulgar.Also, Quora will remove statement of belief that are posted as questions that are not really looking for answers.I suspect that personal attacks based on Trump's looks or his weight might be taken down as violations of BNBR.

Are you sure Quora has moderators?I have heard that they have bots selecting certain phrases and what not to flag Quora use violations. But I know of no one so far who has received any Quora notification that gives the impression of being from a human moderator. Perhaps there are a few, but I doubt there are enough to be able to perform the action you request with the flexibility of an actual moderator, that is, determining what is a “personal attack” in a way that won’t be easily misinterpreted.There has never been a time in our history when presidents were not personally attacked. Why that is considered appropriate is because the founders made clear a president’s character was of prime importance. So if it could be shown that it was lacking, that meant his power should be curtailed somehow. From the kind of attacks made against Trump and by Trump supporters against those critics, it would seem the public should lose power somehow. But unfortunately we are a country that values freedom highest. And as such, we are not ready to combine it with other principles of mutual respect, good will, fairmindedness and such. And so you get this bullshit-slinging in all directions, some simply ill-willed and inappropriate.On the other hand, the president of the US was given powers in a time of monarchy and some of them are monarchical—pardon power for example, executive order as well. So if one cares about democracy, one should find a lot of bullshit sticking to that office quite easy to accept. That’s especially so when the occupant of it is a thug.",201,3,415,"1,648",0,0

3,Should President Trump sign a declaration to end the Korean War and begin normalization with North Korea?,Korean War (1950-53),Presidents,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,"I guess that the best answer to that is “What do we have to lose?”We’ve been at odds (but never at war — the “Korean War” isn’t a declared war, the United States has very specific rules about declaring war, and we never did against the North Koreans) with North Korea for nearly seventy years, it’s a drain on our economy (all of those soldiers posted to South Korea aren’t free, you know,) the North Korean people (who are human beings, after all,) are suffering immensely from the US-led sanctions and they’re a nuclear nation that’s just unstable enough to use them.If the North Koreans are sincere in their wanting to reform their country, they need our help, and our goal of a denuclearization of the Korean peninsula (which would include our removal of said weapons,) is attainable.This is a unique situation — decades of ever tightening sanctions, finally being adhered to by China, have brought the North Koreans to the table. Their ability to hit the United States with a nuclear tipped ballistic missile puts them in a position to bargain, but that’s about all they have to bargain with, and what they want is the assurance that we will support Kim Jong Un’s desire to stay in power, and to do what we can to ensure his survival.So, at a high level, pretty simple, we agree to support and protect Kim Jong Un, while bringing North Korea into the community of nations, modernizing the place and dropping the crippling sanctions, while the North Koreans agree to giving up their nuclear weapons in a verifiable manner.What’s the downside of that, for either side?Cynics will say “Oh, this is just typical North Korean behaviour, they’ll go to the summit, get pictures with President Trump, then get all aggressive and demand everything, agree to give up nothing, and it will fail.”Okay, sure, they might do that. And if President Obama was still in power, he might negotiate with them and get a terrible deal, like he did with Iran.But President Trump isn’t going to do that — a photo op with a President that half the world thinks is clownshoes? Who cares? He wouldn’t mind showing up for that and, if Kim and his team are unreasonable, he will just walk away, like he did when he sent his letter calling off the summit.Doom and gloom apocalyptic scenarios aside (North Korea fires off their arsenal and wipes out millions of people in South Korea, Japan and the United States, quickly followed up by the United States turning North Korea into a nuclear wasteland, killing Kim, his cohorts and pretty much everyone in the country, something Kim is desperate to avoid,) there is literally no downside in the United States’ dealings with North Korea.They come to the table and act belligerent? Trump gets up and walks away. Sorry, you had your chance, we’re done here. Getting up and walking away is Negotiation 101. If they understand that, they’re not going to be belligerent, they’re going to lay out their terms, and see what the President comes back with.Sad that it took this long to get someone in power who understood that.",200,7,302,"1,591",0,0

It needs to be unconditional on both sides. It is a simple technicality, but paves the way for trade and possible reunification of the two Koreas and is tangible progress for the world to see.I don't think we should normalize relations or lift sanctions until the north has denuclearized and that action is verifiable and verified in an ongoing manner. It is understandable that the North is not going to give up nukes without a non-aggression pact with the USA. Which is fairly easy as long as they don't attack SK, Australia, Japan, or any of our allies.NK has trillions of dollars of marketable minerals. It just doesn't have the equipment and infrastructure to mine and export them. So economic aid and development could be eventually offered once sanctions come off.However all that is contingent on denuclearization, the stated postion of the Trump Administration is that denuclearization must come before any help from the USA. With that comes access to aid and investments from countries all over the world. Which is so desperately needed by the majority of the poverty stricken NK population.There is also a major upside to this situation for the USA. The world would see America facilitate peace and integration of a country into the serious club of the international world of both culture and econmics, without a shot flying or a bomb dropped. It won't completely rehabilitate our reputation of being warmongers with the rest of the world, but it will prove that we can and are willing to go that way if possible.",120,9,411,"3,149",0,0

They understood that you do not offer the legitimacy of meeting with a US President with such a man (see links below).Back when the USA had real Presidents, they would meet with responsible leaders who respected the democratic process, who developed sane economic policies that provided jobs, built homes and goods for export, and allowed participation in the world economy. And as we saw last week, Donald Trump has disdain for such leaders, and berates them publicly.Trump, however, lauds Kim Jong-un, who is one of the darkest and most evil leaders in the world. Trump does this because Trump admires Kim’s strength, his bullying, his ability to make opponents disappear into prison cells. The true leaders that Trump berated last week - do not do such things. They build constructive policies that work for their people, that provide trade and opportunities for all nations.Right now, around the world, every other leader is watching how Trump is behaving, watching that we USA citizens do not stop him, and understands that Trump is simply lauding Kim Jung-un, not demanding economic concessions from him, not demanding he create a sustainable, sane economy. As world leaders open their newspaper and check out news blogs, I’m sure they’re very quietly, deeply wondering how America’s stature can recover from such a brutal stunt, shunting aside fellow democratic leaders and embracing the leader that most represented the opposite of America - the opposite of what America was until January 2017.Every moment we allow this diminishing of America’s greatness, granting legitimacy and world standing to one of the worst leaders in the world, we make America look as petty and devoid of values as Donald Trump himself.Brutal and inhumane laws North Koreans are forced to live underLife in North Korea: executions, starvation and fearKim Jong-un's human rights record is among the world's worst Kim Jong Un is cruel and dangerous but not crazy, North Korean experts sayhttps://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/a-life-of-torture-starvation-and-executions-inside-north-korea-s-horrifyingly-cruel-prison-camps-8777170.htmlKim Jong Un's family: The bizarre, cruel world of North Korea's dynastyWorld Report 2017: Rights Trends in North KoreaThe Nightmare of Living in North KoreaNorth Korea human rights abuses resemble those of the Nazis, says UN inquiryhttps://www.indiatimes.com/news/world/did-you-know-kim-jong-un-has-executed-over-300-people-since-he-came-to-power-in-2011_-268383.html",24,1,39,71,0,10

Other states such as California, Texas, New York, and Florida may fit that mold. There is also the question of racial and religious tribalism that inevitably results in wars.Before jumping right into dissolving the state governments with a preference to somewhat autonomous governments tied to judicial districts, perhaps some other arrangement might be superior. Like the south might be allowed to secede as was the intent that brought the civil war, or states might enter into compacts that would PREDICT judicial districts. The point I wish to make is that judicial districts and the interpretation of law will have been the tie that binds any real society. Viewed in this fashion, the end of federalism would probably be accomplished by dissolving the Supreme Court. That would allow no appeal above the regional districts regarding the interpretation of law.

Has your life changed in any way, for better or worse?”Two years ago we were looking at remarkable, balanced, economic stability with promise of more years of the same. All that disappeared in 2016.The one signature accomplishment of this administration, with its impenetrable Congress and captive courts, was the tax act. We are just beginning to see its effect in the nation’s fiscal balance.Unbelievably, the government chose to inject a monster tax stimulus into this year's overheated economy. What the May deficit showed us last week is that even the most depressing estimates might have missed the true cost of the tax bill.In a robust full-employment economy, in prime tax receipt season, there is no excuse for a deficit to occur between April and June. None. It is the time to store gold against the next disaster.Conservatives, though, chose this time to show us an empty wallet. We were $150 billion short in May, when we should have been making money hand over fist. When receipts slow to a trickle in July there's going to be a national shock. It ought to be the central focus of the campaign season. Because it's going to mean problems with Treasury sales, higher rates across the board, pressure on the dollar, a surge in inflation and higher resource and raw material costs, all tending to force the lower half of our society deeper into poverty.Our governing power chose this time, too, to initiate a trade war. Even if it's called off before July 1, the lead time for orders and shipping means that its effects are already in the pipeline. Other nations are currently adjusting their markets and sources away from the US. These are permanent, structural market changes.The US will be able to borrow its way to maintain full employment (probably) through the election - but you can deny the economic pressure for only so long. And the example of Congress and red state legislatures in 2009-11 showed us that conservatives will happily sacrifice the economic health of the country if it means re-election.We have the example of our last conservative executive, who led us into a deregulated systemic collapse in 2008. And our current Great Architect is more renowned for his business failures than his few successes. He'll likely offer us ten cents on the dollar for our Social Security.The Fed will be unable to intervene effectively if things go south, and if conservatives remain in power next year they will opt for austerity over relief. If you substitute ""bankruptcy"" for ""austerity"", you begin to understand.With that in mind, I think our portfolio will migrate into ultra-safe territory over the course of the summer. It’s a major, unwelcome, change because it means abandoning current needed income. In effect, the administration’s chaotic financial policies are forcing us into a protective, hopefully temporary, near-poverty.Of course, it might all be a false alarm, a one-time explosion of the deficit. Keep an eye on it. Conservatives will inevitably draw the false comparison to the Obama administration's desperate moves to right the sinking ship in 2009, but don't let that fool you.

Has your life changed in any way, for better or worse?Evaluations and conclusions are all based on the measurement of what one deems is important to be done, and what objectives you…individually…measure the results.In the history of this nation, America, there are few presidents that can be measured that their administrations…by the results of what they did…can be identified as great accomplisments.As an example, some think that Lincoln’s killing perhaps a million of his other countrymen, was some accomplishment. While there are, others measure it as the greatest travesty this nation ever experienced, internally. Though the same event, there are completely opposite conclusions.The measurement of the president that was the most accomplished…is different for everyone depending on what those things one would think are most important. As an example, one of the worse presidents, for every measurement I have, was Woodrow Wilson. One only has to read his book, ‘Congressional Government’, to realize he has no idea what this nation is, how it operated, or how it was designed to do, what it was designed to do.Yet he is also responsible for the greatest president…by my measurement…this president ever had, Warren Harding. The why is historically obvious, Wilson was so bad for this nation, that all Harding had to do was unravel the absolute mess that Wilson had created. An example is the travesty of the League of Nations, which by the grace of God Harding kept this nation out.Yet Harding, as a constitutionalist, or perhaps it is more accurate to day he was Socratic, using reason, and applied logic of truth to application. His results are historical record. He reduced the size of government by 25% resulting in the cost of government being reduced by the same 25%. He did not interfere with the depression of 1920 – the unknown depression – that because of no interference, lasted only 9 months, and led to the greatest growth of this nation’s economy…the roaring twenties…that ever occurred in this nation. As it was a thriving economy, the outstanding national debt was reduced by 50%, after the debt of WWI and the insanity of the creation of the Federal Reserve…that wonder of Wilson…something still haunting this nation to this day.Trump has given hope to so many Americans, he is as Moses was as he came to free the Jews from the bondage of the Pharaoh. Our economic activity in this nation is on a rising slope not because of any legislation but because of the removal of all the concepts of socialism, communism, and insanityism, that the previous administration placed upon the economic environment of this nation.Every day I wake up, and I’m not hear as I did for the last (8) years some new government intrusion into our economy, our ethnicity, our culture, our society, but rays of hope.

6,Why do states with the least amount of wealth vote Republican?,Voting,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"This is only speculation on my part, but “least amount of wealth” is a very subjective term. For example, those “least wealthy” states also have the lowest cost of living (check out rents and other housing costs). Low cost of living lowers GDP and that skews things a little. The bigger deal is that those states have lower populations overall, and that especially means lower urban populations.Urban populations usually vote Democrat while rural populations vote Republican, though there are a few exceptions. Why is that? This is where I resort to opinion.First, a farmer or rancher with his/her own well and septic tank, a garden and crops or livestock, is far more independent of government than a city dweller who uses public water systems, sewage systems, transportation systems, and even traffic lights to get to work. Cops are few and far between for rural folks so they actually NEED to be able to protect themselves with guns far more than any “New York liberal” can imagine, and they use guns to hunt, to keep predatory critters away from their cattle (and deer away from their crops) and to just “plink” on their own land where they endanger NOBODY. Democrats REALLY need to think about that!Urban dwellers, on the other hand, are so dependent on government services every day and in every way that they see the benefits of actually having government far more than farmers do. But there is another factor. Farmers and other rural people tend to be homogenous in race and religion and even a particular European ancestry, in each region, and they never even meet (many) people of other religions, races, and nationalities.

As much as they oppose Trump’s corruption, I view them as people who would quickly instate their own brand of the same if given a position to do so. Every single one of them is, at least in my present view, a MacBeth type to a tee.

There’s a pathological inability to relate to the other side that holds them back, but this is not unique to American Democrats, being more endemic in American civil discourse today (something encouraged by the leadership of both political parties).There’s too much of an urge though, I think, to believe that simply throwing more government funding at problems will fix them, and so modern Democrats fail where midcentury Democrats had more success: actually planning solutions appropriately and then executing them, rather than just writing a big ol’ checkaroo paid to the order of insert-current-problem-here, or establishing yet another “Federal Alphabet Soup” agency that ultimately becomes a waste of taxpayer funds and may or may not actually do anything (and if they do, it may or may not actually tie in with their original purpose).TL;DR version:Democrats are keenly aware of what the problems are in America today, probably more aware than the Republicans. This works in their favor. Unfortunately, they have very little imagination as regards fixing these problems, and simply believe that “more execution of Government” as opposed to “proper and responsible execution of Government” will fix most problems.

18,What do you think of Republicans?,Republican National Committee (RNC),1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"I have to firstly declare that I am not American and have no voting rights in America. I have however, lived in America and worked at a hospital near Boston as a physiotherapist in the early 90s. I have also travelled to America numerous times and have relatives living in California, Colorado and NYC.My impression of Republicans, as someone looking in from the outside, is that they have persistently through their ideological worldview, brought about the demise of their own society. This is a very sad state of affairs when you consider that America has been a leading light in the world in terms of human rights, social and economic reforms and many other advancements in the field of science and medicine as well as the arts. No longer. In the seventies, American wages were still tied to production. In other words, as companies became more profitable, workers entitlements and wages also grew. For reasons too many to discuss here (rising oil costs, changing economic models such as ‘trickle down effect’ etc), Republican ideals began to move towards a more hard line model of free market dominance over paying people a decent living wage. Reagan (and Thatcher) pushed the line that if we let people at the top of the economic food chain do as they pleased without constraint, they would get very wealthy and some of that wealth would ‘trickle down’ to the rest of us. Fast forward to today and we can see how that has played out. Fantastic for the top one percent. Lousy for the rest of the population.Wages have not gone up in any meaningful way for at least forty years in America. Basic workers rights and entitlements have been almost completely eroded. You can work your arse off in two jobs and still not make the rent AND buy food. Let alone have access to healthcare or education as a means of climbing up the social ladder. Most workers in America are more or less doomed to their lot from the moment they are born. People love all those feel good stories about how someone from a poor background became rich and successful. I think you have more chance of being struck by lightning than becoming successful and wealthy in America IF you are not already born into wealth. Hence the American Dream remains just that, a dream, a fantasy and a Republican tool to keep poor people oblivious to the reality of their lives. Time to get WOKE people.I have been travelling to America since the mid eighties and each time I visit, I can visibly see the effects of hard right economic Republican policies. Hard to believe I know but in the eighties, I was able to wander the streets of San Fransisco with barely a homeless person in sight. Its so bad today that the city of SF has to seriously consider how to deal with the effects of thousands of homeless people without access to toilets defecating and urinating on the streets.I saw the effects of Republican policies on healthcare when I lived and worked in a hospital in Massachussets. I was shocked at the cost of healthcare on the average person. We had friends who were middle class professionals who owned their own home and worked full time in good jobs almost go bankrupt when one of them got cancer and they couldnt afford to pay for his treatment. The house had to be sold to fund his treatment. That was in the nineties when healthcare was far less expensive than it is today. I really believe the measure of the health of a society’s individual reflects the health of the whole society.What have the Republicans got to do with this? Back then, Hillary Clinton was trying to establish a more universal system of healthcare even though she was only the first lady. She was not only obstructed but villified by Republicans. Coming from Australia where our GDP is a third the size of California’s (with the same population as ours), I was profoundly shocked that a little country like Australia can afford to give free or affordable healthcare to its people while America, the richest nation on earth, seemingly doesnt give a shit if Americans are sick or die from lack of access to healthcare. I was there when George W Bush refused to sign a bill granting basic health care to CHILDREN! What does it say about a society that doesnt care if its children can access doctors or basic things such as vaccinations? The really sick part of it is that the health of America’s future labour force will determine its economic success, or not. It makes no economic sense to not look after your people therefore I can only conclude that Republican ideology (ie. you have to pay for everything you use including your education and healthcare) trumps all economic common sense. The countries with the highest standards of living are consistently those that look after and provide fundamental access to health and education for its people.I experienced this on a personal daily level working in the hospital in boston. Workers who had been injured at work were given minimal care and basically thrown on the heap if they were not well enough to return to work. Wealth, even back then, was the single biggest determining factor of wether you were looked after or not if you were sick or injured. And this is certainly the way that Republicans manipulated the healthcare industries with their policies. I believe it is even worse today.I was chatted up in a club one night by a man who told me he was the son of a Republican senator (as though that was a turn on!). He then proceeded to tell me that the reason anyone in America was poor was because they were STUPID! Well stupid would be an understatement for that remark! Either he had no idea of the structures and systems manipulated by Republican politicians over the decades that function to keep poor people in their place or he was himself, genuinely STUPID.The saddest part about the Republican model is that, by creating the huge inequalities between people who have wealth and can therefore access health and education and whatever else they desire, and those who have no means to escape their poverty, is that they have created a society few would want to live in.Our living situation was a microcosm of that society. We lived in a house on a street halfway up a hill surrounded by middle class neighbours. At the bottom of the street lived the poor (mainly African Americans and Puerto Ricans) in ramshackle homes and at the top of the hill lived the wealthy in their gated mansions with security guards and dogs. I would frighten the hell out of my colleagues by telling them that I walked to work. They told me not to as it was too dangerous to do so. It wouldn’t matter to me how wealthy I became if I could no longer safely walk up or down my own street. This is not a country worth living in. Your material assets can never compensate for the lack of real freedom from your fear of what people might do because they are driven to desperate measures by their own circumstances. Poverty leads to crime and poverty for the masses in America has been the driving ideology of the Republican party for as long as I can remember. That’s reason enough not to like the bastards.o",453,31,5,1,0,0

These are strange times.Here is what I have told my kids & what I try to do myself: focus on what we have in common as Americans, as people. I think that can help.I have never cared for the policies, culture & rhetoric of the Republican Party.Basically, I have always seen the party as a bizarre hybrid of religious imperialism & arrogance, obsession with sexual rules to the point of perversion, corporatists & warhawks.These views goes back to my days in high school. I grew up in a Republican county north of Detroit. I also attended a second tier state university & completed a course of study where “ the left” in no way dominated campus life or my courses.So, please know my dislike for the Republican Party is not rooted in a lack of exposure & familiarity with Republican ideology.My views of the party took a steep dive with the election of George W. Bush. A theme then was the “ US needed a CEO & someone who thought like a businessman. “ What kind of dystopian goal is that?Then like a Frankenstein monster, they also listed Bush’s Christianity as a qualification. Isn’t that just like so many Republicans? Jesus & Business. I don’t know if it is hubris or delusion, but Americans were being asked to actually believe that this President was going to promote a culture of life. During his tenure as Governor of Texas, there was an unprecedented amount of executions. I get it, some states have the death penalty. I don’t get how FOND of the death penalty some states are. I live in a state where there never has been one, and that state borders Canada, which did away with the death penalty because or rising concerns of mistakes in trials.

Then he promised his base federal monies in the form of faith based intiatives. He exploited Terri Schaivo to make a point, and he didn’t get his facts straight.What do I think about Republicans? I think their constant sloganeering that they love America is totally meaningless.I resent their religious arrogance and their lack of hesitation to use Christianity to divide and oppress. They are not the only Christians and I am so royally sick of their shit on that issue. This isn’t new. I felt that way when I was 16 and was a practicing Christian.By the way, I mean every word of what I am saying and it doesn’t feel good. My disgust for the GOP isn’t all moral. I don’t think many of the people they elect are incompetent. Lack of curiosity plagues the GOP.None of this should be construed as an assertion that I think the shit of the Democrat Party doesn’t stink. It sure does.Republicans chose party over country. The chose to ignore & deny racism for decades & they still do. The pander to the persecution and fiction of conservative white Southerners and their civil war nonsense. For Pete’s sake, there are people in office that still deny that the South wanted to preserve slavery. At times, they have employed identity politics on a scale that dwarves that of the left.I still cannot believe that Clive Bundy & company pointed guns army federal officers but they see show almost no interest in addressing issues for people who die in policy custody.I can remember all the rhetoric of Ronald Reagen, his pithy jokes about the government coming to help. But military spending sky rocketed. The toxic, pathological response of the religious right to the AIDs crisis was a turning point for me.That is what I think of Republicans.",1k,32,7.7k,"6,990",0,0

Because they’re anti-science, and believe that there’s some sort of international science conspiracy to push the “global warming agenda”, or whatever that is. And since many Republicans are backed by corporations which benefit from ruining the environment, denying climate change helps support their patrons and therefore funnel more cash into their pockets.

18,What do you think of Republicans?,Republican National Committee (RNC),1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"I think they have a different set of tribal loyalties. That’s basically the crux of it. We all have tribal loyalties. And it’s always easier for us to be sympathetic to the concerns of our in-group and unsympathetic to those of our out-group.If you’re a Republican, your in-group consists of:Conservative Christians.Gun enthusiasts.The military.Rich people.When policies are proposed, you will generally be counted on to oppose them if they harm the perceived interests of those groups, even if you yourself aren’t a member of that specific group. Thus, if someone tells me that they think there is a war on Christmas, I can immediately expect them to be sympathetic to the NRA and to support high levels of military spending. I can also suspect that this person will be unsympathetic to feminism and to Black Lives Matter. It is also unlikely that such a person will accept anthropogenic global warming.These ideas are not logically related, though you could fit a certain logic to them if you tried. In actuality, much like Andrew Jackson’s anti-national-bank and pro-indian-removal policies, loyalty to the party and to one’s in-group leads to support for specific policies rather than the reverse. This is my view of the Republicanism of the masses. It’s the dynamic that leads to things like Trump’s 90% approval rating among Republicans, even though many intellectual conservatives once upon a time had huge reservations about supporting him.Now, even though I’ve listed many sub-groups of the Republican coalition, when you look at the leadership of the party, its number one priority, for as far back as my political memory goes, has been to pass policies that benefit the wealthiest. This was evident in Bush’s tax cuts. It was evident when the party shut down the government because Obama didn’t want to make the tax cuts for the richest among us permanent, and it’s been evident in the horrendous tax law passed last year. In fact, it’s the one thing that the party will never under any circumstance sacrifice to any other priority.The result of this stance is that whenever the interests of the population conflict with those of corporations, you can count on the Republican Party to side with the latter. You can see this in the opposition to even the mildest forms of financial reforms, which sought to prevent banks from ripping off their customers. You can also see this in hostility to environmental regulation, even when such regulation is concerned with keeping our air and water clean.One more thing needs to be said about the Republicanism of the masses. Along with tribal loyalties come tribal antagonisms. For instance, in American politics, it’s impossible to appeal to both Blacks and a certain sort of White conservatives. It wasn’t possible in the 1860s. It wasn’t possible in the 1960s. And it’s certainly not possible now. And ever since Nixon, the Republican Party has been hugely adept at appealing to the negrophobic vote. Trump has taken this to a much more explicit level than we have seen in recent memory, but you can see versions of the same thing in Bush II’s dirty campaign of insinuating that McCain had fathered a black child, in Bush I’s Willie Horton ad, and in Reagan’s Neshoba County Fair’s campaign speech.As you can tell from the above, Republicans are very much part of my political out-group.

The Republicans, in fact, are likely to pick up a seat or two. Three Senators, Heitkamp in North Dakota, McCaskill in Missouri and Manchin in West Virginia, are running in states won by Donald Trump by double digit margins.The House? A couple of months ago, I’d have said that the Democrats are a lock to retake it. Today? Not so much. While the Republicans have been trailing the Democrats in the “generic poll” (which asks people whether they are likely to vote Republican or Democrat, without naming a candidate,) and still are, it has tightened in the last six months or so.There are two reasons for that, I think. First, the economy is booming, unemployment is at historical lows, America is taking the lead in one of the most difficult diplomatic issues of the age, North Korea, and while President Trump hasn’t run the stablest White House one can imagine, his administration hasn’t been the complete dumpster fire it was made out to be by the left in 2016.In other words, the average American looks around and says “things are going pretty good.” That doesn’t bode well for a party that says “we’re going to change things.”The other reason is that the Democrats seem to have learned nothing from the 2016 election, as well as most of the special elections that have been held since.Ask yourself, when’s the last time you heard any sort of message from a Democrat, other than “Resist!”? Every election cannot be a “Referendum on Trump,” the Democrats need to develop a platform, explain what is wrong with the country today, and show how they are going to fix it.Every Democrat who faces a Republican challenger this November is going to be hit with ads that focus on Hillary Clinton, and the stupid things that she’s said since losing the election, Senators are going to be hit with their alliance to Minority Leader Chuck Schummer, and, for House members, with Nancy Pelosi, and the stupid things she’s said lately.Those attacks need to be countered with something more than “Resist!” and if the economy isn’t in the tank, arguing against the programs and policies that have brought economic growth like we haven’t seen in decades will be an exercise in futility.So.Forget the Senate, I think that’s a done deal, it stays Republican.President Trump solves the North Korean problem (at least shows some progress toward stepping down that conflict,) the economy is still cooking along, and the Democrats are still talking “Resist!” and “Impeach 45!”?

1,"What do you think about Rand Paul saying there's ""a strong argument"" that Mueller's appointment was unconstitutional, because someone with his level of power should have been approved by the Senate?",Rand Paul (politician),Robert Mueller (American lawyer),1!,1!,1!,1!,"I see we have on Quora a number of legal illiterates and semi-literates who have appointed themselves legal scholars - ridiculing and trashing Rand Paul for admitting he’s not a constitutional scholar and has little legal experience - as Paul proffers the possibility of the correctness of a legal argument - offered by actual constitutional scholars with lifetimes of legal experience.The argument referred to is being put forth by Professor Steven Calabresi and radio/TV commentator Mark Levin, both of whom HAVE worked in the DOJ and ARE constitutional scholars, among their many other accomplishments in the legal arena.From The Times of Israel-“Professor Steven Calabresi, of Northwestern Pritzker School of Law, has published a paper, Opinion on the Constitutionality of Robert Mueller’s Appointment, in which he argues that the appointment of Special Prosecutor, Robert Mueller, to investigate whether the 2016 Trump presidential campaign colluded with Russian agents, was unconstitutional under the Appointments Clause of Article 2 of the Constitution of the United States. This Clause extends plenary power to the President to make certain appointments, particularly, in this case, principal Officers. The Clause distinguishes between two types of officers: “inferior Officers” who are subject to direct supervision and who do not require Presidential appointment or the advice and consent of the Senate; and, “principal Officers” who have broad powers and are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.Professor Calabresi argues that, although appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, Mr. Mueller has become a rogue prosecutor with enormous and varied power, who has not received direct supervision from his boss and, therefore, is not an inferior Officer but, in fact, is currently the most powerful attorney in America. Since Mueller has not been appointed by the President, nor confirmed by the Senate, his powers are unconstitutional.This argument has been supported, adopted, enhanced upon, and conveyed to the general public by constitutional conservative scholar and radio host, Mark Levin, who believes that Calabresi’s interpretation provides a strong constitutional basis to challenge, and reign in, the power of Special Prosecutor Mueller. Levin concurred that “the all powerful Special Counsel was never nominated by the President or confirmed by the Senate” and, therefore, the “Mueller probe is unconstitutional.”This far reaching power contradicts his job description vis-a-vis the Appointments Clause. Calabresi and Levin argue that Mueller, appointed by the Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein, who had no authority to create such a powerful position, has in fact become a principal Officer, not an inferior Officer – or as Levin put it, “a principal Officer with enormous power and his power just keeps expanding, as does the power of his subordinates, which is his responsibility.”Calabresi and Levin agree that it is not possible for Mueller to be an inferior Officer when, in fact, he is more powerful than the 94 appointed U.S. Attorneys, and, therefore, the Special Prosecutor must be a principal Officer. According to Calabresi, this appointment of Mueller as principal Officer and the evidence which he has accumulated as Special Prosecutor are illegal. Calabresi concludes that “everything he (Mueller) has done since May 17, 2017 is null and void” and is “an egregious violation of the Appointments Clause” and the “most gross abuse of power … in the history of the Justice Department since it was set up after the Civil War.”So you legal geniuses criticizing Rand Paul – for not being a legal genius – feel free to refute Calabresi and Levin.http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/c...",2.4k,114,404,308,0,1

Must be a day that ends in “Y”.This is beyond simple. Here’s the appropriate regulation regarding the appointment of special counsel:Code of Federal RegulationsThe very first section reads as follows:§600.1 Grounds for appointing a Special Counsel.The Attorney General, or in cases in which the Attorney General is recused, the Acting Attorney General, will appoint a Special Counsel when he or she determines that criminal investigation of a person or matter is warranted and—(a) That investigation or prosecution of that person or matter by a United States Attorney's Office or litigating Division of the Department of Justice would present a conflict of interest for the Department or other extraordinary circumstances; and(b) That under the circumstances, it would be in the public interest to appoint an outside Special Counsel to assume responsibility for the matter.Spelled out, plain as day. Even the AG recusal is part of the statute. It says the AG unless he’s recused, then the Acting AG… in this case, Rod Rosenstein. The statute is so narrow that it authorizes exactly ONE person to appoint special counsel.Well, as “luck” would have it, that’s exactly who appointed Mueller.This has been established law. It hasn’t even been altered since 1999. And since the SC has never ruled against it (they alone have the power to label something unconstitutional), it stands until such a time as they do.Just because you THINK you should have a say over something that you don’t doesn’t make it unconstitutional. It makes you a modern Republican, who think unconstitutional means “something I don’t like”. The Constitution doesn’t say a word about special counsel or “people with inordinate levels of power need to be approved by the Senate” or any such fiction.",499,17,162,817,0,1

However, they forget that congress and the president DID agree to such in 1999 by making the original regulations regarding the special counsel. Further, presidents & congresses since have decided to let that regulation stand, while no court has overturned it.It was recognized that there was a potential loophole with the appointments clause when it came to the government investigating itself, so they created a type of investigator that could sidestep some of the politics. And, again, 20 years of all 3 branches looking at the issue have found that it comports with the constitution.

It’s based on the fact that Mueller appears to be acting with the independence of a US Attorney, and the question is whether a person exercising that kind of independence can be an “inferior” officer of the executive branch under Article 2 of the Constitution (otherwise, Senate confirmation would have been required).The Constitution provides for Senate confirmation for cabinet members and other offices of the executive branch of the US government, but it also provides that the Senate may waive confirmation for “inferior” officers (employees). The Senate has made such a waiver, because otherwise all government clerk-typists would require Senate confirmation.However, the Senate may only waive confirmation of “inferior” officers, and the question becomes whether a prosecutor exercising the kind of independence that Mueller is exercising is sufficiently subordinate to qualify as an “inferior” officer for whom Senate confirmation may be waived, or whether the Constitution does not permit him to exercise the powers that he does without Senate confirmation.To me, this is a secondary argument, because even those officers who are confirmed by the Senate may be fired by the President for any reason. That is, the Senate gets to approve the people the President picks to act as his agents, but they do not get to tell the President who to pick.The question of whether Mueller should have been submitted for Senate confirmation seems like something of a red herring, because the real issue is whether anyone can exercise the executive power of the United States unless that person is either the President or the President’s agent. This is an important issue because Article 2 of the Constitution allocates the executive power of the United States solely to “the President.” It is not shared with Congress (members of Congress must resign in order to accept a cabinet position or other executive post), and the phrase “executive branch” doesn’t appear in Article 2. The executive power belongs exclusively to the President, and, for that reason, there is no basis on which to argue that someone should be able to exercise the executive power of the United States against the President’s wishes.Therefore, even if Mueller had been confirmed by the Senate, there would still be the question of who submitted his name for confirmation. Under Article 2, only the President has the power to do that, and the President wasn’t involved in the decision. That’s the Constitutional crisis implicit in the Mueller investigation.",126,1,52,"1,456",0,0

8,"Why does the British Conservative party support same-sex marriage, abortion, and believe in climate change? Are British people not angry that they don't have a real conservative party to fight for their rights?",Conservative Party (UK politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Do not confuse superstition, misogyny, lack of education and corruption with being a conservative. As a Conservative I believe in freedom, the good of the British people as part of the world, that useful work of any kind is noble, that helping others is divine, that I am responsible for my own actions, that I have no right to interfere with your beliefs or personal life and that being a straight married white man born in this country does not make me morally superior to anyone, nor that being as I was born makes me morally inferior.The Conservative Party believes marriage to be a good thing and so has ensured that as many people can choose it as possible. We believe in limiting government power which includes keeping it out of people’’s bedrooms.There are practical and ideological points around abortion. Firstly of course there exist Conservatives loudly against it, but a key difference between the US and UK is that British Conservatives have a long tradition of women in positions of authority, including its first and second female Prime Ministers, both graduates of the science faculty of the University of Oxford, including Margaret Thatcher who you may have heard of and is not regarded as being left wing.Having women in senior positions kills stone dead the misogynist policies pushed by the Republican party. A Conservative politician who said on camera that “legitimately raped women had a natural mechanism to avoid pregnancy” would find himself looking for another line of work, but he wouldn’t because he’d be educated enough to know this to be false and possibly more importantly British voters would know it.Thus our Conservative Party is changing the law to protect women being threatened at clinics by pro-life nuts. US Democrats fo all their bluster don’t. We believe in freedom. British Conservatives have seen pro-life laws and seen the awful scale misery they cause.The practical reason is that any party that opposed abortion would be crushed like bugs. There exists a pro-life party, the DUP, widely regarded as evil and stupid by nearly everyone, including their own voters who only support them because they are the “right” sort of Christian.As for climate change, I’ve mentioned science at Oxford. Can you imagine a scientist leading the Republican Party ? Since I became old enough to vote, 40% of our Prime ministers have been science grads from a university in the top 5 in the world all have excellent educations, even the ones I personally oppose.The murderously difficult negotiations with Brexit are being handled by a graduate from a top university who studied Molecular and Computer science (David Davis). Reckon he believes in Intelligent Design ? We have lots of scientists in the Conservative Party, indeed I’ve seen numbers that imply on average that they more likely to vote Conservative than for others.We have had two Jewish leaders of our party, one of whom was the first Jewish Prime Minister. We Conservatives also have put a Muslim in charge of national security, including the police, our borders and MI5 because he was the best man for the job (replacing a woman who previously had worked on 4 Weddings And A Funeral). Our record on race is not exactly spotless, but we are trying. Can you imagine a woman leading the Republicans ? We’ve had two and I’d give odds at least 1/4 that it is another woman, quite possibly a lesbian. Yes we have openly gay people in senior positions in the Conservative party, most Brits could not tll you their names, not because it is secret but because they simply don’t care, because Conservatives and Brits in general are (mostly) grownups who got over this before you were born.At this point I fear I must risk offending you with facts. Brits are on average far better educated than Americans, especially our politicians.As for climate change, a profound difference between the British Conservatives and American conservatives is the level and nature of their education. no one has ever said “Dominic is the smartest person I know”, yet when I speak to American Republicans I find myself using a smaller vocabulary, shorter sentences and not being able to assume general knowledge that an average teenage Brit has For example any British minister would know that the Czech Republic is a peaceful ally of the USA in NATO, many American politician confuse it with Chechnya where Muslim rebels are fighting the Russians. Also Nitrogen is not a poison gas.Ironically, enemies of the Conservative Party often refer to us as as the “stupid party”, yet being a grad of a world leading university is common and more importantly not held against a Conservative the way it is an American conservative. Since Climate Change only requires the level of science expected of an average 12 year old Brit (greenhouse effect, the Sun makes the Earth warm, space is black), the only issues in the party (and they are real differences) is what do do about it.Same with evolution, being educated and honest people, no Conservative office holder would deny it and nationalist Brits regard the widespread American denial of climate change and evolution as irrefutable proof that Americans are congenitally stupid.Hence you may detect some irritation in my answer. This is due to people hearing of the antics of knuckle dragging religious obsessives in the USA and thinking that my membership of the Conservativ party means that I am a moron.You are factually wrong about not having parties that fight for the sort of rights you believe in. We have the DUP which has MPs, wants cavemen having T.Rex as guard dogs to be taught in schools, is against abortion and if they could spell climate change would be against it. They get about 2% of the votes. There is also UKIP which is sort of against abortion, racist and like the US Republican party regards use of numbers over 12 as elitism, it is not expected even to survive until the next election.",1.6k,123,229,310,0,0

Are British people not angry that they don't have a real conservative party to fight for their rights?”British and American politics are different, very different. One of the differences is that MPs have free votes on certain conscience issues, including abortion and Gay marriage. Conservatives are less likely to be pro choice than most politicians, but historically all the parties in Great Britain have been divided on such issues.As for Gay Marriage, Conservatives like power, Gay Marriage was part of the price the Conservatives paid for Liberal Democrat support during the coalition government of 2010–2015 (the price was just giving the bill time to get through parliament, individual conservatives didn’t have to vote for it, and more of them voted against than in favour).Climate change has very different effects on different industries. Historically US policy on climate change has been influenced by the fossil fuel lobby and the makers of big gas guzzler vehicles, industries with a vested interest in putting off the point where climate change has to be taken seriously. The British economy is very different to the US, services such as insurance are much more important. So back in the 1980s when the science of climate change became clear, even an arch conservative such as Margaret Thatcher had to give at least a nod to climate change because the British economy is less committed to the making and fuelling of gas guzzlers, and the insurance industry doesn’t like to be told to pretend that a major risk doesn’t exist.As for the misconception that a conservative party is there to fight for people’s rights, generally human rights are more a progressive issue than a reactionary one. The right to bear arms being the most notable exception. There are British conservatives who supported people’s rights to equal marriage and to choice about pregnancy, though both of those areas you are much more likely to find MPs outside the Conservative Party who stand up for your rights than in the Tories. But in the US I think you’ll find that Republican politicians who support your right to get an abortion or for a gay couple to marry are really really rare.Of course if you are British and you want a party that is more conservative than the Conservatives, especially on social issues, there’s the Democratic Unionist Party, and if you fancy leading a political Party, there’s always UKIP. Both are currently struggling around the 1% mark in opinion polls, though in the case of the DUP that is because they only run candidates in Northern Ireland, not in Great Britain.",600,18,285,"1,363",0,1

It’s quite easy to find ‘conservatives’ who support things (such as universal suffrage say) that their equivalents a hundred or more years ago would find outrageous.Now, there are people who oppose gay marriage in the UK… but not many. We’ve had legalised homosexuality for fifty years now and most people have grown up knowing at least one openly gay person and making a fuss about it would be impolite.There are people who oppose abortion but again not many. Most of those are either Catholic or in Northern Ireland. We’ve had legalised abortion for about the same length of time as legal homosexuality (the same Labour government brought them in) and unlike the US the country is mostly under the same laws on this so there are fewer places where local politicians can make difficulties and claim to be upholding privilege. In fact Northern Ireland is the only place where it is still illegal though the terms it is permitted on are slightly different in Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man.As for climate change… When, exactly did this become ‘conservative’ doctrine?

No. A number of people in the US claim that it is a conspiracy by… someone, a bunch of liberal someones, to do something fiendish to frustrate some people.

It is real, a fact (a genuine fact, not subject to the “alternative facts” bullshit). And it is terrifying. The worst part is the US has become so used to lies that they are not even noticed any more. I first noticed it when “spin doctors” raised lying to a … supposedly respectable profession. And as a brief aside - the fact that global temperatures have not risen very much does not mean the Earth is not gaining heat. The ice is melting, folks, every gram of ice that melts absorbs 80 calories, and that slows the actual temperature rise. Look at sea levels. The UK has built a dam across the Thames to keep the sea out. Ignoring climate change (or, more accurately, global warming) will not make it go away. Personally I despise the “97% of climate scientists can’t be wrong” argument, because it is not an argument. But sea levels cannot be denied.The rest of your question is just bullshit that can safely be ignored. Even Ireland, which is officially a Catholic country, is in the process of legalizing abortion since a recent referendum, which may have been influenced by widely publicised case in which an Indian woman (not a catholic) died because her dying baby was not aborted. In case you are not aware of the story - Abortion 'would have saved wife'. The USA is insane.A last point - the Republican party does not fight for anyone’s rights, just the right to amass money.

Back in the 1980’s and 1990’s, the Tories hated the very idea of gay people. One of the big parliamentary fights was over the lowering of the age of consent, from 21 to 18 (for context, the heterosexual age of consent at the time was, and is, 16). But now? Oh, that nice David Cameron legalised gay marriage. Isn’t that nice? Ignore the fact that most of the blue seats in parliament are still filled by the same dinosaurs that were filling them back when ‘the gays’ were considered to be filthy animals.Global warming. ‘Greenest Government Ever’. Any one remember that? Anyone? Oh, that’s right, it was one of David Cameron’s election slogans back in 2010. How did that work out, then? Never heard of again post-election, you say?Health Spending. It’s not a secret that the National Health Service in this country is under pressure. It’s also obvious to anyone with eyes to see that that is because the current government is starving it of funds under the banner of ‘austerity’. The NHS is a sacred cow to pretty much the entire UK population, so this is not going down well and the plebs are getting restless. Quick, chuck them a bone, health secretary!They are, in short, chancers who want to keep their grip on power, and in doing so attempt to read the way the wind is blowing in order to make the smallest of concessions they can get away with. If they thought there was milage in making abortion an issue, or continuing to oppose gay rights, or denying global warming, they’d be all over that. But there isn’t, because the population here might be stupid, but they aren’t religiously stupid.",531,24,100,433,0,1

Mind you many of those same people have continued to walk through a concourse and talk to their friends while the anthem was being sung in their stadium. They aren’t standing at attention at home when the anthem is sung. Must you be present AND in the presence of the flag for it to be at thing? Should that flag only be displayed in a manner in accordance to the flag code of the US? Can I call out a person for wearing a flag as a bandana or bathing suit (I have one!)? We cannot simply pick and choose our personal preferences for when it’s OK, or by whom it’s OK, to respect the flag.This is similar in that sense to the prayer in school issue. If it’s OK to do a Christian prayer shouldn’t it be OK to do a Musim or Jewish prayer as well? Which Christian prayer too? My principal back in high school was ahead of his time. He gave “silent meditation” time. You could pray to whomever you wanted, or simply stare into space.We get too hung up on things we perceive as ideals, when they are simply totems to ideals.Personally, I wish they’d go back to what they did 9 years ago and still do in college, and leave the entire team in the locker room until after the anthem.

1,Should football players be allowed to kneel during the national anthem?,Protests During US National Anthem,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Q: Should football players be allowed to kneel during the National Anthem?Allowed by whom?Free speech means that the government can’t punish you for your speech. It does not mean that there are no consequences for your speech, of course, just that it can’t come from the government.Ok, seems reasonable on the surface but it’s not nearly so cut and dried.The NFL has a process by which a rule change like this needs to happen and it is clear that process wasn’t followed. The Commissioner never did call for an actual vote of the owners; he assumed it would be unanimous. These changes also have to go through the players union and other approvals before they can be adopted. None of that has happened either.So based on that alone, the new rule is invalid until it does go through the process.There are also antitrust issues since there is no other football league in the US where the players could reasonably go to if they wanted to leave the NFL. It’s not like you work for a Walmart, decide you don’t like their policies and then go get a comparable job at Target. Yes, they are paid to play a game but that is also their career.Also worth mentioning that the NFL recognizes and accommodates for other first amendment rights, like wearing religious symbols so long as player safety isn’t an issue and they are covered. Troy Polomalu has a cross on his nameplate on his jersey but his hair covers it.My biggest concern with this is the role Trump has taken on this fight. As I said before, the government can’t punish you for your speech. But what happens when the government pressures your employer to punish you for speech it doesn’t like?At the very least, Trump habit of calling on private employers to do just that is problematic. But couple that with statements from certain NFL owners that said Trump has directly communicated and colluded with NFL league VIPs in the creation of this rule. Also hanging out there is the millions of dollars that gets paid to the NFL for those big patriotic halftime spectacles.Taken together, this ought to be viewed with serious suspicion regardless of a person’s personal feelings about the protest itself.",146,2,44,542,0,0

Because it’s not a sane gamble at all that Trump will go down in flames in the short-medium term. And if you’re a Republican Congressman or Senator looking to survive the midterms, the short-medium term is all that there is.Look at what happened to Mark Sanford, a conservative Republican member of Congress from South Carolina.Dude voted with Trump like 90% of the time, but that wasn’t good enough; he had the temerity to voice some (pretty tame) criticisms of the president. So Trump lashed out at him, tweeted nasty things about him, and cost him his primary. His career in Congress is over for the foreseeable future.The lesson here is pretty clear. Trump is far more popular than Congressional Republicans, he has a bigger platform than they do, and he has an activist base that will vote as he tells them.I find it kind of hilarious (however earnest) that you tagged this question under ‘morals and morality’ when those things don’t factor into the calculation at all — although I’m sure plenty of Republican lawmakers do tell themselves, in the desperate silence of the wee hours, that they have to keep their positions in order to do good in the future.Trump may eventually wear out his welcome with the electorate; most politicians do. But the Republicans will never turn on Trump unless his base abandons him, and that doesn’t seem very likely at the moment. What would even suffice to accomplish such a reversal at this point?

Not only can’t the GOP legislative heads not move through bills that their base supports, they cannot present a united front with the POTUS because he is so unstable. They basically are along for the ride, rather than being in charge of their respective destinies. This poor leadership makes it easier for many in the GOP to remain with Trump rather than distancing themselves from a man who is floundering and failing.They are poorly informed - Since they seem to avoid any disconfirming information concerning Trump and the numerous legal issues in which he is embroiled, they simply don’t have the tools to understand what is happening. If they only watch Fox News and listen to talk radio shows which support their worldview, they have no reason to believe Trump is failing, even when it is occurring right in front of their eyes.To many, it would mean admitting that they were wrong - Many people are loath to admit that they made a mistake in their support of Donald Trump. They equate any concept of their having made such a mistake to being a personal attack upon them and they cannot separate that belief from the objective realities that face them.They fervently hope that he will be found not to have committed any crimes - They are clinging to the evermore tenuous narrative that Donald Trump didn't commit any offenses (or allow them to be committed) as that will validate their decisions to vote for him and to continue to support him. If they stick with their guy and they believe strongly enough, then perhaps it will “all just go away” and things will return to how they want them be , rather than two they are.They don’t have many other choices - The GOP essentially damaged itself by electing Trump in the first place. It pushed aside legitimate candidates, who wouldn’t have been mired in such controversy, in favor of a real estate huckster and charlatan who consistently demonstrates that his primary concern is himself. His VPOTUS is an even weaker man than himself and their legislative heads are weaker still. Basically, you’d have to go way down the pecking order to find a Republican who would be palatable to a large enough group to take Trump’s place (assuming that he survives politically to make a re-election run possible) and the party and its supporters know this. They stay with Trump because they don’t have too many other choices.Most people when faced with a similar circumstance (A leader who is failing and who is likely to be indicted and charged with one or more criminal offenses at some point during the next few years) would cut their losses and move away from that person and toward someone less controversial and who is more likely to attract a consensus.

If you talk to liberals, it is self-evident that Trump constitutes a slowly-sinking ship. But conservative voters don’t seem to share that opinion. Instead, it is for the Mueller investigation that they are reserving most of their ire. And, even among conservative politicians, many of whom seem to have a fairly low opinion of Trump, the lesson that has been learned is that those who dare oppose him openly will be punished by the voters.And, as the predicted day of reckoning keeps not happening, the logical thing to do becomes surviving for as long as possible. The electorate is highly fragmented. Not many minds are up for grabs. We have reached a situation where Republican politicians realize that they have nothing at all to fear or hope from Democratic voters, and vice versa.Democrats won’t start supporting a Republican because that Republican decides to openly criticize Trump. At best, they will see him as a Republican who happens to be right about one issue. So, there’s relatively little to gain in the short-term. Meanwhile, there is plenty to lose, as the examples of Corker and Flake indicate. And November 2018 isn’t shaping up to be the clear-cut rebuke from voters many of us hoped and expected. Democrats are favored to win back the House, but it will be a narrow victory. Meanwhile, their chances of retaking the Senate are fairly slim. This is because there is no such thing as the voters at large. There are Democratic voters and Republican voters. And no matter how despicable a president is, you’re not going to get his partisans to cross over.So, Republican politicians are responding to the incentives in front of them. And, if Democrats fail to capture either chamber of Congress, a not entirely improbable scenario, Trump will have nothing to fear. He will feel free to quash the Mueller investigation, pardon himself for any federal crime, and behave even more shamefully than he has done heretofore.

And so he confronted a really bad person and got him to the table.One of his more frustrating policy decisions (in my opinion, as a strong free-market capitalist) was his approach towards our trade imbalance and tariffs. I was horrified that he was arbitrarily raising our tariffs that would then hurt our cost-of-living, and especially hurt the costs of our more basic, commodity driven, prices that would have undue impact on the poor.If you read the literature the best approach for winning the prisoner's dilemma type of game scenarios such as this is to use the ""tit for tat"" model whereby you follow your opponent's lead and do what they do.If you read our mainstream news media, he is clearly totally random in his application of tariffs.

No PACs, no secret “donations,” no lobbyists writing legislation.

Eliminate creative districting by any political party. Eliminate voting restrictions on adult citizens, particularly those that disproportionately affect any particular demographic. Base all decisions about voting restrictions on actual quantitative proof of the need.Excellence in diplomacy. Re-invigorate the State Department so that diplomatic and foreign affairs expertise are at the fore of U.S. international policy. Require ambassadors to be qualified for the job in terms of relevant knowledge and experience (no patronage). Treat cyber-crime and foreign interference in our democracy as the highest threat to our national security.Realistic approaches to social services. Develop realistic formulas for Social Security and Medicare costs and withholdings, given today’s longer average life.Health care as a human right. Treat mainstream health care as a fundamental right of every human being. That includes everything from reproductive health to prenatal care to end-of-life care but may not include artificial “life” extension or extraordinarily expensive treatments. Bring down infant and early child mortality rates substantially among vulnerable populations. (This does not require $$$$. It requires $ and adoption of what other countries do (cheaply) to ensure a lower mortality rate.)Environmental protection. Protect our environment— land, water, air— from further degradation. Since we are among the biggest polluters in the world, doing our “fair share” means doing more than most other countries. Become leaders in doing what we can to control further escalation of changes in climate (and make sure Americans understand what “climate change” actually means— a government responsibility).More demanding education. Strengthen our public schools so that high-school graduates can compete with the skills and knowledge that other economic powers have in their high-school graduates. (This does not require $$$$. It requires $ and higher student (family?) accountability for reading, writing, science, and life skills/knowledge for graduation— raise what constitutes performing “at grade level.”) Improve access to higher education/training with students being prepared for a college curriculum or job training/certification program.Respect for the First Amendment. Protect our 1st Amendment rights to freedom of religion, freedom of speech, and an independent press. Value investigative journalism enough to refrain from restricting journalists from being the eyes and ears and fact-checkers of our nation. Fear of government control of information drove the Founding Fathers to make freedom of the press part of the very first amendment. Get Fundamentalist Christianity (and any other religion-specific influence) out of government policies.Respect for the Second Amendment. Protect reasonable expectations for our 2nd Amendment rights to ownership and use of firearms. Be sure that costs and benefits— not emotions—strongly influence what is determined to be reasonable.Realistic immigration policies. Develop immigration policies that address reality. We clearly need more (temporary?) work visas for jobs that are currently being done by undocumented workers because American workers are unwilling or unable to do the jobs. Invest in the economies of countries whose people are emigrating due to serious financial hardship.

9,"Why do people believe the surface-level claim that Republicans are generally ""anti-science""?",American Conservatism,Philosophy of Science,1!,1!,1!,1!,"I’m going to try to give a more balanced answer than the previous ones.The major policy differences between Republicans and Democrats have little scientific component. On climate change, for example, no intelligent person believes that we know the precise effect of, say, a specific cap-and-trade legislative proposal on the economy, how whatever new economic and technological path results will affect the total portfolio of human environmental impacts, how the portfolio of human portfolio impacts will affect climate or how the future climate will affect total welfare (or even what total welfare is).Given that set of facts, some people will conclude that we should take the actions that seem most likely to be helpful (say passing cap-and-trade), expand them if they work and fix them if they don’t work. It’s better to be engaged trying to solve problems than to sit back until the precise right action becomes clear, at which point it may be too late—or at least far more expensive and painful than if we had started early. And even if in the end we do no good, at least we demonstrated a collective commitment to responsible stewardship. We can say we tried our best. It’s good for people to work together on a worthwhile end, even if the end is not accomplished.Other people are against massive government attacks on badly understood problems. They know there will be corruption and cronyism; there will be power grabs and waste. These are known, definite costs. The hoped-for benefits of the actions are speculative; given all the uncertainties any specific legislation is as likely to do harm as good.Note that science has nothing to say about this disagreement. Only if economics and climate science got so good that we knew with reasonable precision the effect of, say, a $100/ton carbon tax in the US today on average global temperatures in 2100, would this be a question for science to answer (there would still be a political debate, of course, but it would concern weighing known present costs versus highly likely future benefits; instead of speculative costs versus speculative benefits).Take any other major political difference between Democrats and Republicans, and one side is likely to claim scientific backing for its views. Democrats are likely to do it on climate change, health care and gun control, Republicans are likely to do it on minimum wage increases, nuclear power and affirmative action. But these are all primarily political questions. Science can inform the debate, but not settle it.So the question should by, why is “anti-science” a charge some partisan Democrats wield passionately; while it’s just one insult among many that partisan Republicans use? After all, both sides can manufacture claims that political disagreements are ignorance of science by the other side; and both parties can find nut cases in the other party to deride.I think there three main reasons for this difference:Republicans include some fairly small but very passionate traditionalist groups that oppose specific scientific findings—mainly on fundamentalist religious grounds. This makes it difficult for Republican politicians to discuss scientific aspects of evolution, stem-cell research or other fields—which makes them vulnerable to the anti-science charge. Democrats have similar groups on issues like vaccination, GMOs and IQ; but these scientific errors are not as long-standing or clear-cut.Republicans tend to prefer smaller budgets for scientific research, especially in the social sciences; this no doubt contributes to the fact that only 6% of people who identify themselves as scientists or engineers vote Republican, and that 60% of political donations from scientists go to Democrats. Scientists in private industry are majority-Republican as are people with advanced degrees in science who do not work primarily in science, while scientists who work for the government or rely on government-funded grants are strongly-majority-Democratic.Republicans tend to be more suspicious of elites. This does not make them distrust individual scientists, but it does make them more skeptical of claims by organized groups of government-funded researchers, and of government agencies run by civil servants with scientific backgrounds.",5.5k,72,5k,"5,787",0,0

It’s blatantly obvious, in fact, it doesn’t require deep research. But it’s not a surface-level claim, it goes all the way to bone, and deeper. It’s not being done in the shadows, but in the bright light of the media. If this were a genuine question rather than a troll, I would recommend the book you linked, The Republican War on Science by Chris C. Mooney. If you were genuinely interested, you already knew where to get that answer.Note well that Trump has tripled-down on this. Compared to Trump, Bush was more launching a skirmish against science, not a full on war. Trump has escalated that to a war on science, and as well, a war on objective fact. A war on basic truth, as discovering truth is always the goal of science.And in many ways, a war on America’s future. The America we know today is the product of our huge technology boom after World War II. Yes, we were the guys whose factories had been modernized as part of the war effort and not blown to bits. But it was free college, with a stipend, for 10 million veterans — my Dad, my Uncle, my Father-in-Law. It was the single greatest influx of the American Middle Class to higher education in US history. It gave us dominance in the Space Race, it gave us the Transistor, the Integrated Circuit, the Computer, and eventually the Internet. It gave us the best hospitals in the world, it built the best Universities, and left the USA as the sole Superpower. That was dominance in Science and Engineering, and that has never been threatened more than today.In both the Bush and Trump cases, the accusation of Anti-Science is aimed squarely at the Republican leadership in Washington, DC. It’s not directly levelled at every Republican, of course. And yet, the Republican relationship to science is just getting worse, year by year. If there are those Republicans dedicated to scientific inquiry and the reality of objective truth, they have been claiming membership in a political club that is racing us back to the bronze age.Some of the various anti-science rhetoric and actions include: \Trump’s claims that anthropogenic climate change is “A Chinese Hoax”.Trump’s supporting the very, very thoroughly debunked medical fraud that vaccines cause autism.Trump withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord.Budget proposal to cut The National Institute of Mental Health budget by 30%.NASA Earth-science missions scrapped — Trump doesn’t want us to even study climate change.The Trump administration banned the words “climate change” and “evidence-based” from Federally run websites.The CDC was forbidden from using words in their annual budge report: “vulnerable,” “entitlement,” “diversity,” “transgender,” “fetus,” “evidence-based,” and “science-based”. Changing the language… a cliched, Orwellian suppression of fact.Trump’s EPA has banned EPA-funded scientists from serving on advisory boards — but not industry representatives.National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine was ordered to stop work on a useful and overdue study of the health risks of mountaintop-removal coal mining.Budget proposal to cut funding for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the E.P.A. by eighteen per cent or more.Trump has yet to appoint a National Science Advisor. In absence of that post being filled, Michael Kratsios, a former political advisor to Peter Thiel, is running the Office of Science and Technology Policy.Existing climate data and other information has been removed from many agency websites, including EPA and the Department of Energy.The EPA and other science-related agencies have 20% or greater staff cuts under Trump.The Trump administration has made it more difficult for government scientists to speak publicly about their work, as well as about misconduct within an agency. It has restricted communication with Congress, placed vague gag orders on agency staff, and failed to affirm the ability of scientists to share their expertise publicly.Trump and Congress have allowed politics to supersede science by signing an unprecedented 13 congressional resolutions rolling back science-based protections, including safe drinking water standards and safeguards to prevent worker exposure to harmful chemicals.Not a single Trump appointee to a science-related agency has any scientific credentials. For example, the head of the Department of Energy is Rick Perry. He’s got a bachelor’s degree in Animal Science… maybe as close as Trump got in any of these agencies. Obama’s men had PhDs in Physics.

9,"Why do people believe the surface-level claim that Republicans are generally ""anti-science""?",American Conservatism,Philosophy of Science,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Let me add to these wise responses an explanation for WHY the Republicans are anti-science: It is in their party’s short term selfish interest to be anti science. Republican party leaders probably believe in science like any smart Quoran, but they are playing the only political hand they’ve got, namely to appeal to the less educated and older voters who are threatened by what seems to them like accelerating social change. Science has been the engine of change and progress since Darwin if not Galileo & Newton. These frightened and often religious folks form the Republican base now. If I were one of them, I’d be a Republican too. To mix poker and chess metaphors (tho the only sensible way to see American politics is as a competitive and totally amoral game), every other move on the political chess board is blocked by better informed and “woke” progressives. Universal health insurance? Obamacare started that ball rolling. A more robust and skilled work force? Employers around the country know we need more progressive immigration policies to get both more skilled people and more manual laborers who do jobs Americans won’t. I could go on, but you get the point. The Republicans are appealing to the only cohort open to them with enough votes to win with.The 64 dollar question is of course whether we will collectively accept science fast enough to avoid destroying the ecology on earth that lets our species survive. It’s clear to me that people who accept and understand science live longer than those who don’t, e.g., those facing a potentially fatal but medically treatable illness who believe in magic—prayer—instead of medicine die younger. My hunch is that the Chinese already know science is the way to go. My admittedly optimistic scenario is that Chinese technology will advance so rapidly as to engineer climate-saving technologies. Of course in doing so they will leave the American economy and its dysfunctional political system in the dust. Trump’s policies are just making this decay happen that much faster.

9,"Why do people believe the surface-level claim that Republicans are generally ""anti-science""?",American Conservatism,Philosophy of Science,1!,1!,1!,1!,"I believe this view was put in place by Ronald Reagan who promoted the Religious Right and its perverted vision of science and reality in order to be elected and then really believed it.Reagan questioned evolution as president of the United States in a speech in 1980. I remember it because at ten years old when I saw him deliver the speech (in a news segment), I couldn’t believe it because he wanted Creationism taught in schools. I grew up in a non Christian family and I was incensed at his intolerance of my world- which was very open to other ideas, cultures, and people - as long as those things included tolerance and kindness towards others and evidence. My parents were strict about school and kindness- my dad has an advanced degree in engineering and my mother had an MFA and was a fine artist. They advocated respecting people’s differences and using evidence as a source for scientific reasoning.Reagan Favors Creationism in the Public SchoolsMany on the Right use flawed science to benefit their ideologies when they want it for political gain - from scientific racism for slavery and labor exploitation, to scientific sexism - which is going strong today even among losers on the Left. They will use science when it helps their political cause and dump it when it no longer serves their purpose.I used to believe some Republicans knew the difference and were just pandering to their base but I realize now that most of them are willfully ignorant when it comes to learning science or anything that doesn’t promote their worldview and privilege.

9,"Why do people believe the surface-level claim that Republicans are generally ""anti-science""?",American Conservatism,Philosophy of Science,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Throughout history, scientists have discovered new things that have sometimes disrupted the status quo. By definition, conservatives want to preserve what is good about the present and the past. For example, the great works of art and culture and systems of law and cultural norms and so forth. Even religious and philosophical ideologies have been brought down by science.So there is a certain tension between new discoveries and conservative views. The more progressive conservatives, if you can accept that concept, are those who are willing to adapt to new ideas and new knowledge while keeping the best of the present and the past. I would argue that in this sense, the founding fathers of the US (many of whom were Deists - a religious and philosophical point of view that developed during the 1600 and 1700’s called the “enlightenment”) could be classified as progressive conservatives. They were willing to replace monarchy with republicanism and support the concept that the government should not establish a religion and that all religious views should be tolerated. These were considered radical ideas by the most extreme conservatives of the 1700’s, and were driven by the scientific discoveries of the 1600’s and 1700’s which clearly upset a lot of political and religious apple carts.Conservatives are perhaps more likely to be skeptical about the findings of science until they are proven more convincingly and that takes time. By contrast, liberals tend to be more open to new ideas but in doing so they are sometimes caught up in crackpot ideas or just plausible concepts that prove to be failures. The Jacobeans who took over the French Revolution are a good example of a too-radical element that did a lot of damage because they tried to take change too far.For my taste, conservative Democrats and progressive Republicans (boring as they may often be) tend to get to the right place more often, whereas far-right Republicans tend to hide from scientific findings they don’t like and far-left Democrats tend to accept wacko ideas without good evidence. Both tend to establish ideologies and then make assumptions based on those ideologies that lead them astray.One more point. In the 1700’s, the Deists were considered virulently anti-Christian because they believed that we learn about God by studying nature, not by reading scriptures (which, in their view, are simply man-made writings that clerics of the various religions attributed to divine origins in order to get others to believe them). The words “pursuit of happiness” and other words in the declaration of independence were taken directly out of Deist writings and were considered scandalous at the time by the various religious authorities.

9,"Why do people believe the surface-level claim that Republicans are generally ""anti-science""?",American Conservatism,Philosophy of Science,1!,1!,1!,1!,"While American conservatives are perfectly willing to eat fruit from the sciences they tend to reject the science fundamentals that are the roots, trunk, branches of the tree of knowledge. They hold a primitive myth of tribal origin more void of detail than the ‘darkness’ it claims was ‘on the face of the deep’ to be the true factual description of the nitty-gritty of the origin of not only their tribe, or only humankind, or our planet as a whole, but of an entire universe they were unable to see more than a myopic blurred fragment of. They hold this despite that myth containing glaringly obvious fundamental … inaccuracies. They hold this pile of mostly plagiarised (from ancient texts of civilisations that had long prior tossed them in their ‘silly nonsense our ancestors thought made sense’ bin - where the illiterate nomads found them and built their world-view around them) folklore to be the inerrant graffiti of god. So deep runs their delusion they ignore facts in clear evidence. They dismiss observable reality. They, like that buffoon Caliph Umar, dismiss entire libraries of experientially and experimentally confirmed science. That early Salafi had the fact that he lived in a very primitive region in an era chock full of superstition and nearly devoid of science. The Ken Hamms of the world have no such mitigation. Where those of Umar’s era had little to see when they opened their eyes. Those Ken Hamms simply opt not to open their eyes - and declare the imaginings on the inside of their eye-lids to be more real than the reality revealed by our senses. (Now amplified so much that we could if need be look at a hair on the mythical dog Cerberus as he listens for Pluto’s (‘his master’s’) voice. Now magnified so many millions of times scientists routinely watch the behaviour of atoms - and design actual working molecular ‘cars’ so small they could rally race cross-country on the head of a pin. No exaggeration.)Why am I describing ‘the Ken Hamms’ and those Creationist numbskulls when the subject group is labelled ‘Republican’? Because when you put Republicans and Creationist anti-science kooks on a Venn diagram it’s hard to tell that there are two circles. (The same can be said when we layer a graph of attitudes about most raw science and basic social issues. The same fact-fail fueling Creationism also underpins the issue that has Republicans willing to endorse and elect to all sorts of high office men who sexually abuse women or children (even joke of it). The Republican who has urged the violation and circumvention of the rights of women to determine whether or not they wish to turn a microscopic cluster of undifferentiated cells into a human being - when that cluster of cells somehow wasn’t prevented from implanting by a random ‘act of god’ (as 3 out of four are). The Republican who, even before they’d aborted freedom through a state loop-hole, were already greasing the slippery slope to preclude access to birth control of the dependable modern variety. The Republican who, if the pattern holds, is apt to redefine male masturbation as an ‘abortive act’ (Onan anyone?) - or to at some not distant date require women traveling to lands where same and equal constitutional rights preserve the right to choose - to choose to take RU486, to use ‘The Pill’ or an IUD - to require women travelling abroad to take a pregnancy test before departure - and again on return. The ilk (Republicans) who will vote for ‘grabbers of unwilling p****’ and molesters of teenage girls are able to twist a rationale to suit their beliefs. Republicans on a Venn diagram are, in effect, the same group as those creationists and anti-free-choice zealots.‘Republican’, now, is statistically synonymous with ‘anti-science nincompoop’. And ‘enemy of freedom/equality’ since they seek to enslave us all to laws not of human making but contrived by the priests of their eternally absent deadbeat of a deity. Democracy dies the instant the law goes from ‘government of the people for the people by the people’ to ‘government of the people for god by god’.Don’t get me wrong. While several years ago I lamented America falling prey to the anti-science anti secular constitutional democracy horde - I, and many like me, are mostly over the grieving. Now we begin to see the silver lining in all this. ‘The silver lining?’ . Yes, the silver lining. Which is the accelerated decline of the American economy driven by product technologies springing from raw science. The gagging of scientists (especially biological scientists) will kill scientific and technological initiative in America. This, until recently, I held as a tragedy. Now I see it a global boon. A European boon. A Chinese boon. A boon to India. A boon for my own Canada. A boon to Taiwan. A boon to South Korea. A boon to all the nations who recognise that secular scientific progress is essential to humanity’s surviving and thriving - today and tomorrow as it has been since the first time a human thought ‘this isn’t good enough - I can make better’ in disrespect and in defiance of ‘divine’ decree. All science and technology, at the bottom line, is … born of heresy. The long, relatively pain-free and comfortable lives we here in the industrial world science and technology made now enjoy - unlike back in the days when we ‘honored god’ and suffered in primitive squalor.The question was ‘Why do people believe that Republicans are anti-science?’ I’d say it’s because the evidence declares them so - even if they are often lacking the wherewithal to see the consequences of their position - the consequences for the sciences when they are shackled by sectarian superstition and fettered by faith.Relax.America is already being out-performed scientifically - even economically. The anti-science aspect of the religious right that’s now synonymous with ‘G.O.P.’ is as disrespectful of the foundation of all science - math - as a consequence there’s amusing nonsense making the Republicans feel ‘great’ again. Like this morning when a conservative ‘news’ e-paper I follow because it gives me a morning laugh crowed that ‘America’s GDP is now leading the world!’ - when a check of all the raw economic data shows that America’s 2.9% growth rate far lags China’s 6.6% - and lags well behind the GDP growth of quite a few nations. That China now has the lead in the telling GDP [ppp] race - loping easily past America in 2017 and on track to be a stunning (and humiliating to Trump-America) 50% up on the US by 2025.It may be a kindness that Republican America doesn’t like math. Because even though it is a part of America’s compromising of the success that ‘STEM’ built it’s blinding them to the reality of what’s happening. Even if not a kindness to those Republican deplorables it is good for the rest of the world - because the more ‘great’ Americans feel - without having any actual greatness happen - the less likely America is too throw a ‘It’s not fair!’ tantrum (a bigger whine/pout than the one blurted at Canada this last week. :)",796,23,78,446,0,0

Although they started earlier, Nixon, Ford, Agnew, Kissinger, Reagan all were active in the 1970s. I think the Tea Party started out with noble intent, got hijacked by the Koch Brothers and became the wedge which drove the Republican Party to the far militant right. The Republicans are now synonymous with certain things that they were really not known for in the past. The Republicans were known for free market solutions to economic problems. Smaller government and more state and local level governance than the federal top down model. I didn’t agree with them then, but since then, they have been taken over by the .01% of the population. But to be fair, most democrats today are bought and paid for by the same .01% so there you have it. The democrats today have no national vision beyond “we’re not Trump” and have not cleaned up its own corrupt infrastructure within the DNC and DCCC. They are squandering the opportunity to really create a vision for the future and unite people together. Unfortunately, this means creating ways to bring back into the fold, those who were fooled by Trump.

Ironically, Bernie Sanders seems to be standing where the Democrats used to be, slightly to the left of center, but in the current perspectives, is accused of being an extreme leftist. Trump’s influence has far exceeded Nixon’s efforts and has encouraged the most virulent bigotry to climb out from under its rocks, which conflicts with JBS official statements condemning bigotry, though several of its members went on to found white supremacist organizations.

Republicans are a diverse group of people with very different and often conflicting beliefs.

Most of them want to pay less in taxes, and get more money or services from the government.For example, fundamentalist Christians are one of the most loyal Republican groups. Many of them want to be able to refuse to comply with regulations that conflict with their beliefs, and typically they want tax breaks for their ministers and property tax exemptions for their churches. On the other hand, many of them want to force stores to close on Sunday or for liquor and gay marriages to be illegal; and they want government funding for their sectarian educational institutions.Libertarians generally side with people who want to be left alone and pay less tax, and fight attempts to restrict behavior that harms no one else and to get government money.In principle, libertarians’ personal political preferences are irrelevant to their policy beliefs, so conservative and liberal libertarians should agree. In practice, libertarians with conservative leanings might view things more in line with Republican groups than Democratic groups.This is particularly true because we don’t live in a libertarian world. In principle, nearly all libertarians dislike government support for religion. But in practice, a libertarian might argue that since the government funds all sorts of non-religious educational institutions, it should fund religious educational institutions on the same basis.

WW2 even have manufacturing companies profit from the war along with putting more people to work during aftermath of the Great Depression.Another pointer he had was wars should be decided by those who will fight in it. This I agree. However, we can do this by voting in combat veterans into office. It’s easy to spend someone else’s tax money on your (the politician) projects. And it’s easy to vote ‘yes’ to send troops (and coming up with excuses to do so) when you and your loved ones aren’t being the ones sent.Limiting military to self-defense is an idea supported by many libertarians because it’s cheaper (much of the budget is used by the DoD.) This doesn’t mean having the US military operate in the US as LEO but rather put use them more as a defensive posture and act as a stop gap when there’s an invasion. I would think in Bulter’s eyes that the Navy and Marine Corps still need to control and protect shipping lanes for the US while the USAF and USA are both used for defensive and offensive (retaliatory force) against an invading country. However, with treaties and such, the US is forced to send troops all over as needed.I understand where Butler is coming from.

However, we wouldn’t need such confining legislation if we, as voters, fired any officeholder who refused to oppose any foreign military action without specific Congressional approval, with formal votes that allowed voters to know who supported and opposed each action. Any Congressional approval of such military activity would also be required to include the specific reason such involvement was the only reasonable solution, a clear list of limitations for areas of operation, types of weapons to be deployed, protection of civilian assets, and a time limit for a successful outcome. Most important of all, it would define the specific goals of the action, and include the specific criteria for defining success, and the means by which successful achievement of objectives would be determined.The last time our military took the field on foreign shores with a clearly defined objective was WW II. Of course, the definition of success was self-evident to all concerned, so it wasn’t what you’d call a heavy lift for the Congress of the day. From VE Day to the current moment, our military activity has occurred with increasingly vague goals and rationale, and virtually no formal statement of how success would be measured, or even what constituted success. This includes our conflict with the Soviets, which began as soon as the Nazi’s surrendered and has never truly ended, despite the name changes that nation has undergone. The complete rationale for the Cold War was basically “Us good, Russkies bad”, or simply “Communism Bad”. Can you imagine how things would have changed if both nations had been required to publicly define success during the Cold War? Now we’ve reached the point where Congress doesn’t even bother supporting or opposing military action in any formal way. And the rationale is still “——— Bad”, with the blank filled in whenever it seems appropriate. No one even asks “how do we know all this effort and money is worth the result, since we don’t even know what the desired result is?”.

1,"If you ranked those who've damaged the modern Republican Party the most, where would you put Newt Gingrich?",Republican (political party),Newt Gingrich (politician),1!,1!,1!,1!,"Damage has negative connotations and ranking people by who have done the most or the least amount of it assumes that the party is a static thing and even in a party of conservatives the party is hardly static. The republicans tolerate dissent on most things and this is what is called freedom, rather than the near on lock step that is required of democratic operatives. It turns into a bit of anarchy when complex issues are called to vote. The Democrats have the democrat platform and it really doesn't matter which democrat you put in office they will tow the line for the democratic platform almost every single time.Republicans are all over the map inside the everything except what Democrats believe in. There is some overlap in the Venn Diagram of the two parties but each election cycle these days separate the two.Gingrich has been out of office for nearly 20 years. He was in the mix when there was probably 50% more overlap between that which republicans believed and Democrats did. His damage, if you want to call it that, was minimal.Make no mistake though both parties are on the move and they are both moving left - however the Democrats are nigh on socialism at this point. Republicans now are 1990 era democrats on all but abortion really.I would agree to change 'damage' to movement then I think Trump is moving the party to the left more than Pence or Cruz or Huckabee or even Bush would have. I would say they are moving left but are still slightly right of center. Trump is damn near a centrist with no great vehemence against anything. He would give 30 million illegals full path to citizenship amnesty if they would give him 12 bill for the wall. I believe he would - because he wants the wall and the people are already here and uprooting all but the criminals would be a national effort. A domestic war if you will. No one wants that.What the Democrats do NOT want is for Trump to be the great liberator who legalized millions. Then those millions will only know that Trump was president and now they can become citizens. The democrats lose their mouthpiece for calling republicans evil for enforcing the laws that they enacted in the 90s. I digress.No the point is that the Democrats are running so far left whilst the repubs are slow walking left maybe slightly behind and to the right of center - Trump is almost on center. Pence is right of center, as is Cruz and Huckabee. Sanders is a socialist and H. Clinton is just right of him but still well left of center. Damage, as I see it, is moving your party further from center faster than the middle can shift. Sanders tried this and the Democrats knew he was too far left and would get stomped out in all but 10 states so they railroaded him (but ensured that the media stayed on the Russian hack story (fabricated to cover the murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich leaking it) rather than the contents of the hack). When the Clintons are involved people come up dead. It is really weird.Obama was smart about it in 2008 and role played himself much closer to center than he was. By the 2012 the cat was out of the bag, but he was still able to beat Romney who may have been a little too right. Trump - the centrist was just in the right spot at the right time when Democrat fatigue had set in and Clinton had sprinted left to keep up with each other Sanders in an effort to garner his votes. The late Seth Rich saw this and leaked it and wound up dead. The media, always on board with the DNC - pushed the Russia narrative to cover the outright corruption at the DNC who wanted to hand it to Clinton.Damage. Republicans. Hardly.The Democrats are fully undone trying to figure out what level of identity politics can win against their seemingly disorganized, but far more centered Republicans.",19,0,30,484,0,0

The FBI spied on Trump and his campaign and did it with the knowledge of DOJ and Obama was briefed on it. It doesn’t matter what four senators say, or even what Trump himself says. The facts are there. Could there have been a proper motive as Democrats have insisted? Yes, but there are distinct problems with that theory.Probable cause was based on an unvetted dossier provided by the other campaign.It appears that a deliberate effort was made to entrap members of the Trump campaign.Trump was not advised that the FBI suspected that Russians may be trying to influence his campaign and they were investigating by embedding informants (spies) in the campaign. But what if Trump was in on it or initiating collusion with Russians? Good point, but they quickly found out that was not the case (Strzok’s own words). At that point, he had to be briefed or they were trying to entrap him.These 3 factors combined amount to the Adminstration trying to sabotage the Trump campaign, ala Watergate.I do always wonder if the Trump campaign was informed that Manafort was under investigation. He was fired shortly after he was hired and at a critical time of the campaign. The timing of that always seemed suspicious. Also people seem to forget Obama’s public assurance that the Russians did not interfere with the election. Was he lying?

1,How have the demographics of Republican voters changed from the Reagan era to the Trump era?,Historical Eras,Ronald Reagan,Republican Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,"How have the demographics of Republican voters changed from the Reagan era to the Trump era?This appears to be pure population demographics — with related psychological elements. Reagan is 1980, the Baby-Boomers were in the age range of 15-35 years old.They had been raised on Vietnam, the Cold War, and the boom of the 1950’s under the shadow of “Duck & Cover” and McCarthyism. The bulk of the adult voters had gone through the Depression and War. RUSSIA was the bad guy, and there was the oil embargo crisis of the Carter years.Thus, Reagan came in with two classes of people — both indoctrinated to hate or feared Communists and one remembered the worst of economic times, while the other knew only the best of those times. And Reagan had been through it, plus he was a visible anti-communist pro-black list figure (which made the racist Republican antisemites happy — another trait of the older element).Regan’s generation was moving to the suburbs and rural areas to retire or have that second home in addition to the first home they got after the war.Trump is dealing with the anti-war Baby-Boomers who recall the good times of their childhood and experienced the gas lines of the embargo period (just when they were trying to do their “Happy Days” hot-rod monster-car Route-66 thing).Those Baby-boomers are now turning 70 (as of 2015) and they want the comfortable Social Security retirement they were promised and saw their grandparents living. They are angry at the Republicans for squandering that retirement — and angry at the Democrats for not stopping the Republicans.Trump also has the the next generations — those children and grandchildren of the Boomers — who are moving back to the cities so they can walk to work or to any stores they need. The rural areas are being abandoned — and those whose lives are settled are remaining in the suburbs and rural areas and are hard-line Republican.The demographics of the Republicans have changed, in that they are more concentrated into the bigoted and ignorant segment that was once diluted. For Trump, the demographics are weird — the sales pitch is easy … play to ignorance … the the traditional depression era rubes that carnival barker’s and Tent Show Elmer Gantry evangelicals (cum TV preachers and Mega Church pastors) used to love. These folks now carry the Electoral College votes and always vote against their own best interest — so can easily be taught or convinced to hate National Health Care … it’s something the “BIG CITY TYPES” want so they can live of the government instead of being slaves to “the man”.Trump knows to sell to them as one of them — he also knows their way of life is a sham that the Right-wing has been living off the same way the Elmer Gantry types did during the Depression Era. So basically, the Trump Era demographics are a reversion to the Depression Era of Racism and anti-Semitism (toss in anti-Latino and anti-Muslim or anti-OTHER, all of which marked the Prohibition era)",43,1,193,"2,732",0,0

2,Are there any bipartisan meetings taking place where Republicans and Democrats are trying to find a way out of this impending constitutional crisis?,Democratic Party vs. Republican Party,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"There have been any number of meetings over the last few years on restoring function to the congress. Unfortunately, the dominant factions in the republican caucus have higher priorities.The republican House caucus is paralyzed because it is divided between corporate conservatives, populist conservatives, and ultra-conservative True Believers. All of the factions are anti-government and anti-tax. All of them pander to the republican base.The corporate conservatives are not as strong as the others on conservative social issues. They tend to want the economy and the government to continue functioning to serve the interests of business, which they consider to be the purpose of elected officials.The populist conservatives are convinced that liberals are destroying America and believe all federal government programs are part of that effort. They still support programs like Social Security and Medicare for their own constituents, whom they consider virtuous, hard working Americans, but wish to cut those programs overall, as they believe that most of the money involved goes to minorities and illegal immigrants who are parasites on the system and addicted to government handouts.The True Believers consider all non conservatives to be a threat to America and wish to use the powers of the federal government to dissemble it and punish all liberals, who they believe to be outright criminals.It does not help at all that most of these congressmen are very limited in their breadth of education and intellect. Within their political belief system, populist conservatives are simply suspicious of intellectuals. The few they respect work at conservative think tanks and universities. Among corporatists, legislator is considered a secondary profession. The people who make this a career choice are not the “best and brightest.” If they were, they would have become business executives or corporate lawyers. They are like accountants, advertisers, and media consultants. They are in their positions to serve the the respected elite who know how to generate wealth.The democrats have factions, also, but they are not relevant, as the populist conservatives and true believers in the republican caucus usually will not work with them at all. Which makes sense, as these republicans either believe or pretend to believe that all democrats are fakes and criminals. Republicans who do try to work with democrats are subject to powerful attacks by right wing media and organizers.The situation is only slightly less difficult in the senate, where most of the members are more experienced politicians at the national level and most still have some sense of the purpose and mechanics of government. They are the “voices of reason” whenever the True Believers want to shut the government down, as they believe that American voters are still capable of punishing the republicans for failures at the federal level.The current crisis has President Trump at its center, but it should never be forgotten that he is president only because the most powerful national republicans refused to stand against him during the primaries. They knew perfectly well that he was erratic, ignorant, and dangerous, but were unwilling to risk alienating base voters. They were, and still are, the only people who could stop Trump from destroying American credibility, alienating friendly governments, or starting a war with Iran or Korea. The only priorities that move them to action are cutting corporate taxes and approving ultra-conservative judges.

2,Is this new attempt by congressional republicans (led by Senator Bob Corker) to limit President Trump's ability to invoke national security to tax foreign imports a popular move? Could congress use legislation to successfully limit him?,Bob Corker (U.S. politician),U.S. Senate,1!,1!,1!,1!,"I don’t know about “popular” or “unpopular” in this context, but Congress absolutely can use legislation to limit, or completely eliminate, the President’s power to impose tariffs.A tariff is a tax. The Constitution gives exclusive power of taxation, including the power to impose tariffs, to Congress and Congress alone. In fact, until 1913 when the 16th amendment was ratified establishing the income tax, the ONLY forms of federal taxation were tariffs and excise taxes (which are essentially sales taxes on luxury goods).So how can the President impose tariffs “on national security grounds”? Well, Congress delegated the Presidency that authority through legislation passed about 50 years ago, during the Cold War. There are, perhaps, legitimate constitutional issues raised by this delegation of authority, because separation of powers prevents one branch from using another branch’s constitutional powers (even with that branch’s permission.) But the power has been used very sparingly over the years and in the absence of someone with standing to sue over tariffs challenging the president’s actions in Court (Congress itself would have standing; businesses affected by the tariffs might as well) the courts cannot determine one way or the other whether this sort of delegation of Congress’s taxation powers is Constitutional. (The federal courts, including the Supreme Court, can ONLY respond to cases brought before them, and cannot initiate action on their own.)Congress has delegated authority to impose tariffs to the President in several very limited circumstances. The main reason for doing so is that it is a useful power to have in negotiations over trade policy, and such negotiations are in fact the responsibility of the Executive branch. The specific power to impose tariffs for national security grounds was intended to prevent the U.S. from becoming dependent on a hostile foreign power for key imported goods. It was not remotely contemplated for use against countries with which the United States has formal military alliances, like Canada, the nations of Western Europe, or Japan. Congress could take several actions to overturn the President’s actions in this case; it could pass a specific law repealing these specific tariffs imposed by the President, but this would require a veto-proof majority in both Houses because the President would be certain to veto such a bill; it could pass a new law rescinding the grant of authority that allows the President to impose tariffs under these or any other circumstances (again, this would require a veto-proof majority); or it could sue the President, arguing that these specific tariffs do not conform to the intention of the law allowing him to impose tariffs on national security grounds, since the tariffs are being applied to allies rather than potentially hostile nations.Each of these would be within the Constitutional powers of Congress.Would they be popular? So far, I don’t think the tariff issue is drawing a very strong public response one way or the other. But if the Trump administration gets in to an escalating trade war with a number of other countries simultaneously, this will hurt specific American industries and perhaps the broader economy, and may create a political constituency for Congressional action. It’s hard to say, though, because we’re in sort of uncharted waters here. Presidents have imposed limited tariffs in the past under authority delegated by Congress, but those have generally been highly targeted and short-lived and focus on one country at a time. The kind of sweeping tariffs on multiple countries simultaneously that Trump has imposed is not something we’ve seen before; he’s going much further in using the power delegated to him by Congress to impose tariffs than any of his recent predecessors has. It would therefore be a perfectly valid exercise of Congress’s power to take back the authority it delegated to the presidency decades ago, or to restrict that authority to a greater degree.Whether the current Congress would choose to act is an open question.",370,23,4.2k,"1,843",0,0

People’s votes were in secret. And most people were NOT active politically in any way except voting.Now, EVERY ISSUE is becoming political. People are not allowed privacy or freedom of speech. Or the right to even be apolitical.Businesses should not be political AT ALL. They should merely do THEIR business.I began seeing this with Gore vs. Bush, and it has become increasingly worse.When Hillary called half of Trump voters “deplorable”, THAT was deplorable.How dare a politician belittle NORMAL, COMMON people? It is normal to demonize or belittle one’s adversaries or competition. But COMMON, ORDINARY people and their SACRED right to vote, believe, and think?!Of course, people are going to hate Hillary. She put down NORMAL, COMMON people. Trump put down lots of things, but not normal, common people. Rather he made himself out to be a CHAMPION of normal, common people.To me and many people, Hillary’s Low was so much worse then Trumps or anyone else ever before. Putting down common, ordinary Americans NOT involved with politics particularly!?And then the George Soro’s paid riots where people were mocked, ridiculed, and beat-up merely for voting for Trump. People minding their own business, approached, forced to tell who they voted for, and then mocked and beat-up.This is APPALLING and so ANTI-AMERICAN.Trump is the most uncouth, arrogant President we have probably had, at least in a long time. But the Soro’s dominated mainstream media and the Democratic National Party are the primary ones to be blamed for Trump’s rise in power because the American people cannot stand the Left attempting to take-over our country, change its values, change its vision, and mock, belittle, and beat-up anyone who DARES to NOT be a leftist. And Leftism is very close to communism and antithetical to nearly EVERYTHING our Constitution and Declaration of Independence is all about. Trump is an ANTIDOTE to the Left destroying our country. I just wish we had a moral, Christian Republican instead of Him. Making our Country Great again with civility, manners, and traditional American and Christian values. But Trump is the one that has the guts to go against the politicians and the media to “Make America Great Again” economically and as our OWN unique nation, and not just another leftist socialist country.",56,2,25,527,0,0

Almost all Republicans in Congress — except for those who are leaving — are yellow-bellied, low-life, sniveling scumbag cowards. That’s especially true of Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan. The Republicans impeached Bill Clinton for lying under oath. How does that compare with all the misdeeds of Donald Trump. For starters, how about the Emoluments clause of the constitution. In a world of uncertainties, there are three things you can be absolutely sure of: death, taxes, and that Donald Trump’s principal aim in his presidency is to enrich himself, even at the expense of the safety of the United States and its citizens.Then there’s the matter of obstruction of justice. How dense do you have to be to think he’s not guilty of the crime. Perhaps Congress thinks it’s not an air-tight case. It doesn’t have to be. All that’s necessary is for Congress to THINK that he committed obstruction of justice. Impeachment is not a court of law; Congress can do whatever it wants in regard to impeachment. If they’re not lacking the proof, there is one thing they’re lacking: balls. I realize that Joni Ernst and the rest of the female Republican senators were born without them but what’s the excuse of the men.When someone writes a book entitled “The Decline and Fall of the United States”, they won’t lay the blame on Donald Trump because his deceitfulness has always been evident.

Those that are running for re-election have probably made the calculation that opposing Trump will hurt their chances more than it helps.The Republican party has long had its own thinly-veiled propaganda arm in the form of Fox News, but as John Boehner recently pointed out, “There is no Republican Party. There’s a Trump Party.” [1] When the Republican Party dissolved into the Trump party, Fox News became Trump’s own personal propaganda arm. This is cemented by the fact that Trump normally talks to Sean Hannity once or twice a day. [2]It’s very difficult to take positions against a politician with their own propaganda machine and win in the court of public opinion. Polls show that 76% of Republican voters think Trump tells the truth all or most of the time. [3] Even those who think he lies often like him anyway. Trey Gowdy recently experienced what happens when you get on the wrong side of the propaganda machine when he dismissed Trump’s ridiculous “Spygate” claims. He was immediately smeared by Hannity and many members of his own party. [4]The only thing that could possibly cause the congressional GOP to turn against Trump is if something scarier than loss of support by the Fox-News-watching base became visible on the horizon. That one thing may have arrived… loss of support from the donor class. [5] Some of the biggest Republican donors, most notably the Koch brothers, are launching a war against Trump’s tariff policies. [6] This has prodded some members of the GOP to join forces with some Democrats to block Trump’s tariffs through legislation. [7] I’m sure they’re expecting to be smeared by Fox News as a result, but the whole calculus has changed now. The Kochs, with their recent support of Democratic Senator Heide Heitkamp, have demonstrated their willingness to support politicians from either party who will support their agenda.

But his threats and intimidation towards Senators and Representatives in Congress, which ended several careers, led to Congress giving up their Constitutional responsibilities as well as Conservative values, beliefs and principles.Thus, the Republicans in Congress are losing their hope and morale. 44 so far have decided not to run again, including their top fund raiser and one of their two leaders, Paul Ryan. While Flake and Corker continue to defy Trump and never gave in, the others are broken shells of men and women, having given up everything for nothing. This bodes poorly for the Mid Term exams.The Justice Departments decision that a sitting President cannot be criminally indicted, if this were normal times, would be a Constitutional Crisis, as if a leader is above the law, we are no longer a Constitutional Republic. But these are not normal times, and while Mueller’s investigation is taking out many of Trumps former and current staff, lawyer and perhaps family members, Trump himself is now considered above the law, which violates the very core of our system. Congress will not impeach unless the new Congress early next year is differently run………which it may be.The strong economy given to Trump by Obama, Bernanke and Yellen continues to thrive.

1,Do Republicans idolize Ronald Reagan?,Ronald Reagan,Republican Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"Do Republicans idolize Ronald Reagan?No. Idolize isn’t the correct term. The large majority of Republicans do feel that Reagan was one of the better modern day presidents. He was widely dismissed by Democrats of his day as a not particularly intelligent 2nd rate actor, completely ignoring that he was the two term Governor of California.Under Reagan, the US experienced robust economic growth spurred by bipartisan tax reform. He enacted a bipartisan immigration reform which legalized the large majority of illegal immigrants (Democrats later reneged on the enforcement part). And of course America witnessed the disintegration of America’s greatest international adversary at that time, the USSR, which ended the Cold War and re-united Germany and freed many Eastern block countries.Reagan did this with a Democratic majority in the House. He had an incredible personal relationship with the Democratic Speaker Tip O’Neil despite coming from polar opposites on the political spectrum. Chris Matthews has written about their relationship:Tip's daughter Susan recently told me about her father's feelings toward Reagan: ""He liked him.""When Reagan spoke at Tip's goodbye party in 1986, he said: ""Mr. Speaker, I'm grateful you have permitted me in the past and I hope in the future that singular honor - the honor of calling you my friend.""I didn't get the full picture on this fascinating relationship until much later. After the assassination attempt, Reagan was in far worse shape than was publicly known when Tip arrived at the hospital. Max Friedersdorf, the president's congressional liaison, was alone across the room.In a letter to me, Max described how the speaker went to Reagan's bedside, took hold of both his hands and knelt. ""Thanks for coming, Tip,"" he heard the president whisper.The two recited together the 23rd Psalm. Tip rose, kissed Reagan on the forehead and said he didn't want to keep him from his rest.Max shared this story long after both men were gone. It would have been good to hear earlier - because it shows how deeply these political giants recognized and honored their shared humanity, despite their stark differences of philosophy.It is a joy to savor it now.Chris Matthews - What Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill could teach Washington todayTop 10 Reagan Achievements | Human Events",2.8k,192,7.2k,"2,166",0,2
1,Do Republicans idolize Ronald Reagan?,Ronald Reagan,Republican Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"Idolize might be taking it a bit too far, but yes, many on the right do admire Reagan because Reagan was a pretty darn good president.When he was elected, America was not in a good place. Stagflation had kept the economy moribund, gas prices were through the roof, unemployment was up and wages were down. Abroad, America’s military was in a bad place, hollowed out by years of budget cuts under the Carter administration and stinging with humiliation from its defeat in Vietnam. The Cold War had turned decisively against the United States and its allies, too. Communism was on march everywhere, in Latin America, in Europe, in Asia, and in Africa. America was indisputably in decline.Reagan brought that decline to a screeching halt.He embarked on a massive modernization program that rebuilt the US military into the premier fighting force it remains today, and embarked on a foreign policy that turned the Cold War back in our favor. Reagan knew that the Soviet Union was hollow beneath its iron shell, and adjusted his foreign policy accordingly to exploit its weaknesses. American began to push back against the Soviets everywhere. He restored American prestige on the world stage by unabashedly and publicly embracing the values it stands for and by denouncing communism at every turn. His domestic policies revitalized the US economy and created countless new jobs. GDP growth under the Reagan presidency skyrocketed.So, yes, many Republicans and conservatives think highly of Reagan because he made both America and the world a demonstrably better place. He restored American prestige on the world stage, revitalized the US economy and brought the Soviet Union—the most formidable geopolitical foe America ever faced—to its knees.The left, of course, has never forgiven him for being so successful.",2.8k,218,359,74,1,0

4,"Has Trump inflicted the most damage to the Republican party, to the US, or to global trade?",Republican Party (US politics),Trump-Pence 2016,1!,1!,1!,1!,"The answer in my opinion is the Republican Party. Trump is not really a Republican, and has over the course of his life been a Democrat, an independent, and a Republican as it suited him. He seized the Republican party as a vehicle to boost his ego and sell his product, which is his name. I do not believe that he actually thought he would win, and strongly suspect he did not really want to.While he did the country the one service of keeping Hillary Clinton out of the White House, he has done so at what is likely a large cost to the Republicans for such a short-term prize.With his impolitic tweets, revolving door of rogues into and out of his cabinet, and nearly daily serving of items for the left to rail against, he has galvanized the Democratic party almost from sea to sea. He has made what are frankly entirely reasonable ideas (e.g., that a country should enforce its immigration laws and defend its border) into disruptive and controversial tokens of bigotry. I suspect that, come November, his mere presence in Washington is going to lead to a sea change in the congress, and may also give the Democrats control of the more important prize of local and state offices.One thing that the DNC did just disastrously poorly for the past decade was to focus its entire energy on DC, pouring its resources into winning the presidency and a few House and Senate seats. Their lack of interest in ground-up politics made it easy for the Republicans to capture 33 of the 50 governorships[1]. The GOP control both houses in 33 of the 50 states (the Democrats control only 13)[2]. This, and not imagined “voter suppression” is why the Democrats control basically the cities.Well, Trump almost by himself has made it possible for the Democrats to undue some of the damage that their leadership did to the party for the past 10–20 years. The Democrats flipped the House of Delegates in Virginia[3]. They have thus far “flipped” 40 state house seats since Trump was elected[4].As far as “the US,” I would say that Trump in the short term has not really done any “damage” to the country. The bulk of his bad ideas he tried to put in place by executive order have been largely blocked by the courts. He has been largely unable to convince the congress to pass key policy ideas, such as they are.The president is not a king, so the optics of Trump are worse than the reality.In the long term, I actually believe that Trump is sort of like a vaccine, and will be to the benefit of the country rather than the detriment.The simple truth is that, for years and years (decades?) presidents have grabbed more and more power. The imperial presidency we were warned about has come to fruition. Too many people actually believe that the president “runs the country.”This is false, and thanks to the scrutiny (and anger) that Trump is generating, people are waking to the idea that the president needs to have his power contained.President Obama, who just months before said, as a constitutional scholar, that re-writing immigration law was outside of his power, issued an executive order on DACA. Ditto for the Iran “deal.” Real treaties require a vote in our legislative branch.Whether you like the outcome or not, this is an egregious over-reach. The reason why Donald Trump can so easily undo Obama’s “legacy” is because he was attempting to legislate by fiat.The same was true of George W Bush and Bill Clinton, and Ronald Reagan. Richard Nixon famously quipped that something was not illegal because the president did it.Trump is going to be gone, sooner rather than later. And his legacy may be that we stop pretending that the president can just “make things happen.” It’s ironic, but restoring a better balance between the executive and legislative branches is healthy.As far as global trade, pick up a newspaper. The global economy has never seen better numbers. The economies of the US and our leading partners are growing at rates not seen in 20 years. Trump is not the cause of the growth, despite his frequent claims that he is, but the idea that global trade has been damaged is not supported by reality.Footnotes[1] Republicans control 33 governors’ mansions. Democrats want to put a dent in that in 2018.[2] Democrats Got Wrecked Again in State Legislative Races, and it Matters More Than You Might Think[3] Virginia Democrat Appears to Win Recount by One Vote, Tipping State House Balance[4] Democrats flip 40th legislative race of Trump era, this time in New York",87,0,260,"1,756",0,4
4,"Has Trump inflicted the most damage to the Republican party, to the US, or to global trade?",Republican Party (US politics),Trump-Pence 2016,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Trump will inflict damage in three ways—short-term, medium-term and long-term.I will elaborate when I have more time, but these are my conclusions:Short-term—the U.S.I have faith that American institutions will take a beating but will fight back, hard, like they did during the Nixon Administration. With Trump, I feel like American institutions caught a nasty flu and are fighting off the disease with a powerful immune response that’s gaining steam. People tend to forget that Trumpists are still a minority. And minorities almost never dominate in the U.S. for the long-term.Medium-term—Republican PartyThe GOP will either shrink as Trumpists take over and exclude everyone else. Or it will split along Trumpist lines. Either way, the GOP is doomed and conservatives will have to revive it after Trump’s followers all die (most are over 65, so that will take one to two decades to sort out). Few millennials are embracing Trumpism, mostly because they’ve grown accustomed to growing diversity and an open-trade economy, so few Trumpist replacements will be forthcoming in the next decade or so.Long-term—U.S. trade and international relationsThis is where Trump will cause his most long-term damage. Once you become the country who elects someone so volatile, unpredictable and stupid, few countries will think you a credible partner anymore. That means that trade treaties will be much harder now to enforce, especially in a way that could favor the U.S. And U.S. international relations have now taken a massive beating, and China is only too glad to fill in the void.",559,26,664,439,0,0

Global trade and the American political system will heal themselves and my best guess is that after the mid-term elections, the process of bringing Trump to justice and making structural adjustments to prevent another Trump from acceding to the office again will begin apace. And the tragedy of his damage to the party is that I consider myself a Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt Republican. I vote Democratic because the GOP no longer tries to pretend that it is not the party of Plutocracy and Oligarchy and it has been also taken over by regressive, brain-dead Christian Evangelicals.

2,Are prison sentences too long in the United States?,Incarceration,Prisoners,Prisons and Prison Life,1!,1!,1!,"One night I heard a statistic, courtesy of Trevor Noah, that the USA has 5% of the world's population. Yet we have 25% of the world's prison population. Of course, the source I heard it from said it was to our shame that it should be so.So I got to thinking why it may possibly be that way. Of course, the social scientists and true believers in the ""innate goodness of man"" want you to buy the fact that the ""system"" is racist, picks on the poor and uneducated who merely commit crimes because they are addicts and/or poor, trying to feed their habits or families.Is there not another reason? That our nation is the one who has dedicated professionals, from police, to prosecutors & defense counsel, and has juries of everyday people who will take the needed time to consider innocence, or guilt, and hand down a punishment to the offender, while allowing the not-guilty to walk? Think of the labs set up to determine the fingerprints and DNA of the unknown suspects. The forensic artists who can recreate a person’s face from applying clay to the skull, or can add years to a child based on their early photos. Forensic dentists who can match bite marks. All those collected bound volumes of vehicles, tire tracks, edged weapons, tools & tool marks, natural, man-made & animal fibers, and paint samples. The labs which can tell you which brand & type of gun fired a bullet and then match that bullet to the gun when it's recovered. The technology to find and restore serial numbers filed off of bicycles, guns, and other stamped, serialized objects. The labs which can identify a poison. My lord, there’s even a facility where they bury or otherwise place donated dead bodies in various conditions to decompose so that they may gather the scientific knowledge to determine how and when another crime victim’s body was left by killers. Keep in mind that often times, that all this science stuff actually eliminates or exonerates suspects, even freeing people from previous bad convictions.Let's say your loved one is the victim of a horrific crime in Botswana, Burma, Bulgaria, or a remote village in Bolivia. Do you think the local cops and prosecution will be sending out samples of evidence to tie the suspect to the crime, or ID them in the first place? Even (so-called) techno-savvy and industrialized Japan, has a lack of crime labs and medical examiners, the further you get away from the large cities - I read an article where a young man was found dead in a remote area, with cigarette burns on his body and multiple slash and stab wounds to his torso. The local “medical examiner’s” conclusion? Heart failure! Somewhere in Japan, a killer is (or, killers are) walking free, to kill again...and likely get away with it – if forensic services do not improve.European justice? Remember the idiot in Norway, who killed 84 people (mostly teens and children)? He got 26 years in prison, roughly 123 days for each life he snuffed out. Kill one, or kill 200, if caught for murder in Norway you get just 26 years. You want that? South African justice? Shoot and kill your girlfriend while she’s in the bathroom. You’re sentenced to eight years. You’re out in less than two. Then the courts change their mind and you’re re-convicted of murder and you’re headed back to prison.Please know that “justice” in many other developing and third-world nations is what you get by your own hand. You track down and beat (or perhaps kill) the person who wronged you or your family. Only if you can, with no help from the authorities, though. Likely, his surviving family will do the same in regards to you…and on and on it will go – The Italians have a word for it, vendetta.I will admit that our criminal justice system is not perfect and yes, the racist label has been justified, sometimes. But because a few case are slanted, racist and rigged - it does not render the entire system as such. No more than merely signing a pro sports contract will make one a superstar athlete - some will achieve that level, most others will not. You have to admit that here, more than one rich, prominent, and/or elected official has been imprisoned for their acts – there are some people who learn the hard way they are not above the law.I can appreciate the fact that most people on Death Row and or serving really long sentences have worked damn hard to get there. While some may see the system as harsh, I see it as too soft, too rigged in the favor of the offender. Those of us in police work call it a ""Hug-a-Thug"" mentality.In my 40 years of police work, and likely thousands of misdemeanor and felony arrests, I would be surprised if 10% went to prison for a long time. Yes, I have a murderer on CA's Death Row. He will die of natural causes. The kidnapper/rapists I nailed? They're out by now - they got 25 years and I'll bet they didn't do all 25. The guy I arrested off-duty for shooting & killing his ex-girlfriend’s new boyfriend two doors down from me? Out in 3.5 years of his 7 year sentence. Most of the people I arrested for drugs? They got probation and treatment. Maybe on their third or fourth screw up, they got more; but really, first time drug offenders (with no other priors and or extenuating circumstances) don't do hard time - don't buy it, automatically, when some bleeding heart, (so-called) social justice warrior tells you it's a fact.06/07/2018 EDITED TO ADD: This response, however interpreted, was intended to respond to Trevor Noah's Daily Show comment.

2,"Let’s say if I owned a business and I fired every radical conservatives and radical liberals, could I do it, and would Americans thank me?",Political Radicals,Political Radicalism,1!,1!,1!,1!,"For the long answer.To understand how you could even ask this question, you must first look at the past history, compare it to the present day, to even begin to plan for the future of your theoretical business.From my lifelong experience in working as a union and non-union member in both right-to-work states and closed shop states I learned how horrible unions can be. During my first real jobs as a labor, truck driver, and an equipment oiler on a heavy construction project I learned the hard way. Since I was a temporary employee working summers to earn enough money to go to college during the winter I did not feel compelled to join any of their unions. On that project, no matter what your title was you either worked hard or you got a pink slip (fired.) I didn’t have a problem with that as I’ve always been thankful for having a job. I was threatened by the union and was even almost killed by them as a crane operator wiped out the back of my concrete mixer truck as he swung the hod bucket into it. I barely jumped out of harms way as I caught it coming out of the corner of my eye. After that I wouldn’t let a union operator lower my truck down over the spillway we were pouring during an earth fill dam project. It required chaining the truck to a D-9 Cat as the slope became close to perpendicular at the bottom.My parents went through two world wars and the great depression so that was the way I was raised. Just to lay some background on building in our history I might explain what you’d be dealing with today.During the great depression there are many great stories of accomplishment which will never be equaled. During that time period there are many great stories about accomplishments such as the Golden Gate Bridge ,which only took just over three years to build from January 5, 1933 until May 27, 1937. Men would be camped out waiting in line for someone to fall to their death and the contractors would hire a person to take their place. The golden gate bridge was one of the 20th centuries 7 wonders of the world.Also built during the great depression was the Empire State Building which only took 15 1/2 months including a winter from January 22, 1930 until May 1, 1931 which was another of the 20th century’s seven wonders of the world.It only took Five years to build the Hoover Dam during the depression as well. The contractors were allowed seven years starting on April 20, 1931. The concrete in the dam was completed on May 29, 1935. The reason it took so long is only because of the time it took a concrete pour to cure (dry) ENOUGH before the next pour. (If it was all poured at once, it would have taken 125 years for the concrete to completely cure.) As it is it is still curing after 83 years and getting stronger all the time. A project worth putting on your “bucket list” if you’re at all interested in engineering or even accomplishments of mankind. All features of the dam, including the 16 generators were completed by March 1, 1936.I have to chuckle when I see reports talking about how Trump cheated workers out of money and didn’t pay them for services rendered. What they don’t mention is that contractors failed to live up to their contracts, they hired illegal immigrants without general knowledge and were held to many re-do’s because of failures in construction. Construction of Trump Tower, as one example, started in September of 1980 and was completed in July 1982 just under 2 years with modern day tools and equipment. The left leaning Wikipedia article is filled with false propaganda and half truths, which is par for the course. Every project today is filled with similar problems, delays, and work stoppages, due to corner cutting, at times poor craftsmanship, laziness, and even strikes. I can attest to that as I’ve seen it all of those during my lifetime. It’s just expected as business-as-usual today.Back to your question, what you might expect in our modern world of so called ""progress"" as commonly referred to by progressives.If you owned a business and fired people solely because of their political beliefs you sound like you’d be a radical yourself running the proposed business. However, when we refer to people as liberals and conservatives only, we tend to paint with too broad a brush, which is done far too often today as well.Conservatives tend to believe in an honest day’s pay for an honest day’s work. If you work hard and keep your nose clean you should be a success is more or less their motto. Also, conservatives believe that one should be promoted by merit and ability to do the job only instead of seniority only, which liberals, unions, and Democrats believe. Actually only the hard working model works as it should. The model of the times when people were thankful to even have their jobs instead of expecting to have them, which is far too common today.On the other hand liberal Democrats seem to believe that private enterprise business’s are bad to begin with so they will usually not strive to be successful as far too many tend to think the world owes the a living. Democrats fall into the category of being liberals and tend to depend on unions whether they be skilled crafts, government employees, and even teachers unions to even get elected. They tend to be more corrupt than conservatives. Once your business depends on union workers you may as well close the doors, because no matter how successful the business is the workers eventually will despise you for making more money than they do. (The Bernie Sanders worshipers) They usually are told by their leaders to believe they don’t make enough. You can never pay a union member enough to suit them. You can’t fire a union member as the leaders make it impossible by organizing the rest of the “group” to slow down, strike, or even sabotage your business at times.So the bottom line is that if you plan to start a business, keep it a non-unionized family business, preferably in a right-to-work state, which more and more states are becoming, as they’re aware of the all the corruption and problems which come with organized, unionized, labor. Hopefully we’ll get rid of the federal teachers unions and, once again, become a world leader in education someday in the futures, but that is only the wildest of dreams today.That will take a revolution, which is actually sprouting up all over and beginning to take some roots with our the young generation today. I’m afraid that the “millennial generation,” in large part, about 1/3, may be known someday as the lost generation unless of course they win with their socialistic philosophy. Then we’ll be just another third world country.The only hope in eliminating so much waste in governmental jobs and so called service unions is to privatize much of their services that we depend on today. For that to materialize the Democrat Party, which is actually the problem party is going to need to change and become part of the solution and not the party of hate, obstruction, and destruction in this country.Just listen to them on a daily basis. Ten minutes of CNN and MSNBC will make you so depressed you’ll begin to believe Armageddon started yesterday.Get over that. Get a life and remember, today is the first day of the rest of your life. You CAN make a difference as long as you know the past, know how the problems started, and how to avoid more destruction in the future.We have far too many philosophers, sociologists, and history majors and too few skilled labors in the world today. If we’re ever taken over by socialist dictators the lazy, spoiled, disruptive obstructionists will be the first of be eliminated. The skilled labors and hard working people will always be necessary for the country to survive.",49,0,12,113,0,1

7,How would you absolve the US of its budget deficit as well as national debt?,Fiscal Responsibility,Sovereign Debt,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Very simple, by doing what socialists thought was going to happen 120 years ago:Turning the public infrastructure of the banking system[1] [2] from a private, profit motive-driven, all-encompassing and debilitating parasite[3][4] into a non-profit public utility, abolishing and forbidding interest[5] , funding the new bank with a capital/land tax[6] and untaxing labor while socialising the rest of all nationally critical infrastructure everyone needs (housing, electric utilities, roads, transport, education, natural resources, healthcare, etc.).The reason it hasn’t happened yet is because it’s been opposed by the rentier capitalists (monopolists, speculators, landlords and most of all bankers) for hundreds of years. They saw what was coming in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and they fought back. Rentier/financial capitalism is not the same as industrial capitalism, by the way. Though we have won a significant victory in the last hundred years, which is to get off the dreadful gold standard.I believe in time, we will succeed with this broader goal as well though it will be most difficult in your country of America than the rest of the west, because the neoliberal/neoclassical and austrian school propaganda there has been more profoundly successful. With the success, a “budget deficit” will be called a public investment and governments won’t even be in debt at all because they will issue their own currency unlike today.A “budget deficit” is really a twisted way of saying a public investment. When the government runs a so-called “budget deficit”, it is putting more money into the economy than it is taking out or recycling through tax. It can do so because it issues the currency - or it was supposed to, but that function was deliberately captured by private bankers.Footnotes[1] Banks borrow from the public and create the money supply.

1,"How can the scope of the federal government (USA) be reduced, and thereby reduce the power of the two major political parties?",Political Philosophy,Political Parties,1!,1!,1!,1!,"My thoughts.What must be done first is to eliminate all the amendments that were unconstitutionally declared ratified and/or simply unconstitutional. Some State Constitutions would have to be amended also.The problem that pinpoints why the following Amendments must be eliminated is the fact that the Republic was willfully destroyed, by mainly lawyers, when the SCOTUS, lawyers, stated that the unconstitutionality of these is a political issue and the court won't entertain suits against them. The courts, lawyers, know that most of the powers held by the federal government are not lawful. This, of course, doesn't stop the courts from incarcerating and fining people for supposed violations of them.The ""Constitutional scholar"" generally gets the title after being instructed by other constitutional scholars who have also been taught, or perhaps indocrinated would be a better word, by previous ones. Since most of this instruction is in an academic environment, one must adhere to teachings in order to pass and be awarded with basically a ""Constitutional Scholar"" Certificate.One problem with this is any falsehoods, accidental and intentional, entering the teachings can perpertrated as facts for future scholars. These ""new"" facts are also taught to the general population to encourage their acceptance.Another area is that proper English word usage and meanings along with English concepts of implicit vs explicit, context defining meaning of words with multiple definitions, etc.Now consider that all of the Founders did not want a Republic where all political power rested in the People. Consider a scenario where certain seemingly innocuous but well-understood phrases were inserted into the Constitution with the idea of using them to undermine and eventually destroy the American Republic.Far fetched? Maybe not.Americans have accepted unconstitutional actions by the government because unelected judges have amended the Constitution by simply issuing a ruling that said those actions were OK.One example is the Kelo decision. With the stroke of a pen the SCOTUS drasticly amended the Constitution by the simple method of ""redefining"" the words ""Public use"" from the longstanding understanding to mean, essentually, anything the government deems a benefit. A company wants certain properties to build a mall? No problem since that will bring in more tax revenue and that's a good public use. Dozens of citizens who have lived there for years displaced? Sacrifices must be made.Americans are taught that the Founders created the federal Constitution. This is misleading because not all of them wanted a Republic. Some wanted a monarchy; some a pure democracy; some an oligarchy. Those against a republic, in my opinion, worked to have seemingly innocuous provisions inserted whose language could be used to destroy said republic. Provisions for each House of Congress to make it's own rules with no oversight has led to the members excluding themselves from laws they pass. Setting outrageous pension benefits for themselves.Another seemingly warranted provision that is at the core of the republic's destruction is found in Article 1, Section 8. This gives Congress exclusive jurisdiction over the District of Columbia.Let's start with the alleged 14th Amendment. The former Confederate States, after being welcomed back into the Union and after voting to ratify the 13th Amendment, were refused their right to Suffrage after refusing to ratify the 14th. The Northern Congressmen refused to seat those former Confederate Congressmen. They then passed the Reconstruction Acts that called for the military occupation of those States; the overthrow of the duly-elected officials and the appointment of replacements by Congress. These appointed officials then voted to ratify the amendment. Still think its constitutional?Among other things, this alleged amendment created a new citizen, all of us now, that is a subject of the federal government. These new citizens have no Rights, only immunities and privileges granted by the federal government. Some of these mimic those enumerated in the Bill of Rights and create the impression that you have Rights protected by the Constitution. These federal citizens, actually chattel, are deemed to be citizens of the Seat of Government, DC, and as such subject to any and all whims of the federal government.""Privileges and immunities clause of Fourteenth Amendment protects only those rights peculiar to being citizen of federal government; it does not protect those rights which relate to state citizenship.""Jones v. Temmer, Federal Supplement, Vol. 829, Page 1227 (1993)The fourteenth amendment created citizenship of the federal government. This status is a privilege granted by the government.""We have cited these cases for the purpose of showing that the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States do not necessarily include all the rights protected by the first eight amendments to the Federal Constitution against the powers of the Federal government. They were decided subsequently to the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment...""Maxwell v. Dow, 176 US 598 (1900)That is why we have go pay the government for the privilege of getting married; of using the public roads; and even having a pet. Still think you are free?The 15th for the same reasons as the 14th. This one forbade the several States from disallowing non-state, these aforementioned federal citizens, from voting. Having non-state citizens vote in State elections is the same as having non-citizens, foreigners, vote today. Remember, only the several State Citizens could vote in Presidential elections. These new citizens would have been considered aliens since they were not Citizens of one of the several States. Note that it took a Constitutional amendment to allow citizens of the District of Columbia to vote for President. These 14th Amendment citizens are deemed to be citizens of the District of Columbia since that is the Seat of the federal government.The 16th which was not properly ratified because some states modified the wording before voting which should have mandated that it be returned to Congress, tge changes debated and ibcorpirated or nit, and then resubmitted. This amendment was unlawfully declared ratified by Secretary of State Alexander Knox. This is claimed to allow the federal government to tax everybody but it is more insidious. The feds already had that authority under Article 1 Section 8. This alleged amendment was to divert the people's attention away from the actuality of the fact that they, we, own nothing; all our property is owned and taxable by the feds.That is why the SCOTUS ruled that the government can take your property for any reason and give it to anyone else despite the clear wording of the Constitution specifying public useThe 17th which is itself unconstitutional since it violates the very clause that sets out the amendment process. Mainly that no state shall be denied it's Right of Suffrage. All the States voting ""No"" were denied their Right. This removed the last vestige of the old Republic, the several States control of the Senate. The bureaucrats now have direct control over their territories. Sound familiar? The people have been given the illusion of electing candidates but are simply choosing from a list of pre-selected clones.The courts stated that we must rely on the very people who created and are enriched by this treachery to correct it. Yeah, like that is ever going to happen.Rescind the Buck Act which created federal areas overlaying the several States. This is one other way the feds control the citizenry.Since the Constitution does not delegate to the federal government the authority to have land except for those expressly set forth, all lands, including parks, forests, monuments, etc., How about an Amendment that these supposed federal lands revert back to the respective several state.",180,3,14,38,0,0

What had been the most likely Democratic House pickup instead became a guaranteed Republican hold. They face the same threat in several Orange County districts this year.For Republicans, it means they’ll regularly get locked out of statewide races.

They’re named for the Greek philosopher Zeno of Citium whose teachings became the school of thought known as Stoicism, which NeoZeno describes this way:[At its core, Stoicism is the rejection of irrational interpretations of the events that surround us and the wholesale acceptance of the idea that rationality holds the only real path to truth.]The first thing I read on the site was the entire Steele Dossier story presented as a timeline of short, factual statements. [1] It was a refreshing reminder that no person, party, agency, or government is always in the right or wrong. Reality is never black and white, it’s always grey. Just because a person or organization was on the right side of history today doesn’t mean they can’t be on the wrong side tomorrow.[1] Steele Dossier: Alleged Unlawful Use of FBI FISA",1.7k,11,120,353,1,4

A source becomes credible when the reader understands their bias.For example, HuffingtonPost is a very liberal news site. When I read the HuffingtonPost I understand that.

When I read Fox articles or watch a Fox show I understand that they are delivering an interpretation of the facts with a conservative bias. And because they are consistent in their bias I think that they're reliable.Bloomberg views everything from a financial standpoint. So when I read a Bloomberg article I know that's what I'm getting. And that makes Bloomberg reliable to me.Every article that is written by an actual human being is bound to have some kind of bias.

The ones I listen to most are the ones that are going to do the best job breaking down the arguments faculty but while fully knowing they will have a leaning to the left. The ones I listen to on the other side are the rare ones that I find that I trust to be honest brokers, and to make a strong attempt to be accurate ( these things are not common in right wing media in my view) but to give me the best case presentation about why I may be wrong. Because I will better know what arguments I need to strengthen my views in a debate, and also where maybe the weak points or even wrong parts may be so I can address that.The biggest key is knowing the Bias, and finding balance. There is no such thing unbiased news. But having a mix of smart accurate news from many multiple views, is your best chance. Knowing that MSNBC did not start out with a liberal leaning view, and that its biggest bias it to ratings and it just happen to find them with more liberal views, while Fox was started with a specific goal of advancing conservative views, knowing Huffington post is going to be liberal and click bait driven, and the Weekly Standard is going to be most old school William Buckley conservative, CNN is going to try to be down the middle but ratings driven...And that info wars if fake.

There is therefore not a layer of state or county government that can oversee and manage tax breaks for businesses and generally encourage business, which is largely a feature of Republican philosophy. The other reason is that Republicanism tends to favor small government, and is often openly hostile to the federal government, which has enormous influence (of course) in DC. Finally, African Americans have been reliably Democratic voters for several decades now, ever since the Great Shift in politics, when Southern Democrats largely joined the Republican party.

So capturing a big bloc of voters the Democrats were moving away from, merely because of their odious views on racial hierarchy, seemed like a potential route back to more national power.

Ironically, if you were to actually compare policies side-be-side for the last 50 years (removing party affiliation) - you’d find that Reagan’s policies more closely match that of modern day Democrats than current Republicans.This is why comparisons like “The party of Lincoln” are so inane. They are intended to imply a sense of consistency where none has ever existed.",78,5,556,338,0,0

6,"If a Democratic President said he is above the law, how would Republicans react?",Democratic Party vs. Republican Party,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"They’d freak out.Trump didn’t actually say he’s above the Law. He said he can Pardon himself for anything.Somantics.You see a Pardon is also an admission of guilt. So by pardoning himself he is admitting guilt. This almost guarantees an Impeachment if he pardons himself for Conspiracy Against the United States. Not even his most vocal defenders can reasonably back that.Blanket Pardons, as in a Pardon that covers any crime, ever committed may not be legal either. The President has unlimited Pardon power but that is not legally the same as a Pardon for unlimited crimes. He has to be specific as to what he is pardoning and failing to do so guarantees that this will end up in front of the Supreme Court.If SCOTUS drags this out he might get voted out of office only to discover that his Pardon doesn’t stand as it lacked specificity. Then he’s screwed if the Prosecutors can make a case.The best lawyers in the GOP keep telling him this but he ignores Grassly and Kennedy and Graham. His own SCOTUS nominee is a guy that from prior rulings would likely not rule for open ended blanket pardons. Ginsburg and Sotomayor would likely strike it down and Samuel Alito is a known stickler. That’s 4. John Roberts isn’t giving anyone an unlimited blanket Pardon. Not if it’s not spelled out specifically so, like Alito. Kagen might be partisan. Which means Clarence Thomas might need to be really persuasive.This statement was never meant to make himself out to be invincible. It was meant to distract from the new Mannafort development that ole Paul is even dumber or more brazen than we thought. He openly attempted to witness tamper and did it visibly.Trump will have to Pardon Mannafort. Or Mannafort flips but Mannafort accepting the Pardon is essentially admitting to treason. Mannafort is screwed and has screwed up Trump because Mannafort has demonstrably, actively colluded with the Russians.If Trump had just let Mannafort go early this might not even be a thing but he didn’t do that. Mannafort has exposed Jr. and Kushner as well.Nothing, so far, has implicated the boss though. Pardoning Mannafort won’t make this go away either because any sign of weakness after that and the GOP will turn on him.Rudy Giuliani should stay off television. He is running a PR campaign but doing it in ways that might guarantee an appearance before the Supreme Court. He is exacerbating legal challenge potentials not putting out fires. He argued that Presidents can’t obstruct Justice even though that is exactly what happened with Nixon. It’s the one crime a President can effectively be charged with, though not while seated.This is silly really. That No One is Above the Law has always been an accepted axiom. Maybe President Trump pushes this but he might not like the results. Maybe the Supreme Court lets this go but the way he handled his first Pardon, with Joe Arpaio, put him and the courts on alternate paths. That fence can be mended but not if he keeps kicking out boards.Trump likes to make bold sweeping claims but then backs down when it’s time to put up.

That’s unlikely to happen, and he faces a job review in four years, but he’s the guy for the moment.They tell him to put together a leadership team. However, they say they don’t have a lot of money, so he has to use people the company has already hired and who already support him as CEO (about one third of the employees won’t work for him and are out to stab him in the back)So, he goes through all the resumes of the eligible employees, and here’s who he puts in charge:He finds a guy who ran his own company, and puts him in charge of financeHe learns he has an ex-astronaut on the team, and puts her in charge of their transportation divisionHe finds a guy who ran a security company, and puts him in charge of securityHe finds a former farmer, and puts them in charge of the agriculture division.He learns one of them is a doctor, and puts him in charge of the health divisionAnd so onNow we go to Donald Trump. His board was desperate so they give him a four year contract. Its clear they can’t fire him except with great difficulty - there are a lot of legal hurdles before they can.

5,Why are conservatives pro-life?,Pro-Life Movement,Pro-Choice (Stance on Abortion),1!,1!,1!,1!,"Short answer: From Roe v Wade, January 1973, until roughly 1979, conservatives, including and especially evangelicals, were virtually silent on the decision. Six years and not a peep, at last in opposition. The Southern Baptist Convention actually issued a statement of support for Roe (which they have since repented of). In the late 70s, a man named Francis Schaeffer, an otherwise brilliant theologian and apologist, who really thought the ruling was an execrable legal decision (with which I personally concur), joined forces with the Republican party to bring attention to the abortion issue. Recent medicine and science had made major breakthroughs in the area of when human life—“personhood”— began, and Schaeffer sincerely felt abortion on demand was equal to the Holocaust. *Meanwhile, another issue is stewing among the right: Bob Jones University was about to lose its tax exempt status under the Carter (Democrat) Justice Department because of its racist policies (no interracial dating allowed, for example). With Republicans still smarting from the Nixon Watergate scandal, they needed an issue that would galvanize conservative evangelicals—what would go on to become the “Moral Majority”—in opposition to Democrats. Problem was, at this time, most evangelicals, especially southern ones, still tended to vote Democrat. The idea was to use the Bob Jones case, but that proved problematic as racial tensions were finally ameliorating somewhat in the aftermath of the turbulent 60s. Bob Jones was TOO polarizing.Enter: Dead babies. LOTS of them. Nothing shocks the conscience like garbage bins full of dead fetuses and late term aborted babies. But how to motivate Protestants? Frankie Scaheffer, Francis’ son, told NPR,... The very fact that the Catholics were talking about this meant that maybe it's wrong, because Catholics can never be right about anything. ... Theoretically, because the Catholics were against abortion at first made Dad very suspicious of the issue. ...But his suspicion of it was also mirrored with people like Jerry Falwell and [Pat] Robertson and these other guys who at first said the same thing when he came to them. ... Their whole reaction was: ""What do you mean? That's a Catholic deal. Why would we take a stand on that when we believe in contraception and all these other things? Isn't that part and parcel of the same deal?""So in the early days of the pro-life movement, most of the religious leaders ... didn't want anything to do with what Dad was doing, because they said: ""That's a Catholic thing. We're all about Jesus Christ and a personal relationship with the Savior. Why would we want to be sidetracked on this stuff?"" …If it had gone slightly differently, we would have had a completely different history of the United States at this point. There would have been no Ronald Reagan, no George Bush, no religious right, no evangelical groups to back these people. It was on a knife edge there in the late '60s and early '70s. Could have gone either way.And I think the reason why the pro-life movement took off and became huge actually had nothing to do with abortion. It became huge because it was, ""We've got to draw the line somewhere against all this secular encroachment on our religious culture founded by Puritans."" ...A lot of people were just waiting to draw the line somewhere against this rising tide of secularism they felt encroaching on their space. They wanted to fight back. No one had showed them how, because you had to have an issue around which to coalesce, and abortion was a handy issue.I think what proves my point is the way similar issues have been used subsequently. I mean, what does gay rights have to do with abortion? Nothing. So why are the same people fighting about that and using the same techniques? What does health care reform have to do with euthanasia? Nothing. Why are they using the same thing?Because the secular culture is going to take your children away; they're not going to heaven with you. You've got to draw the line somewhere. We have to fight back, so you pick a handy club with which to beat the society around you into submission. ...And if Dad had come down the pike and written a book and passionately had a series of seminars saying that we have to stop our kids listening to rock 'n' roll, and we've got to get an amendment in the United States Constitution saying, you know, anything with a drum beat has to be made unconstitutional, it may sound crazy, but it could have been that. ...God In America - Interview: Frank Schaeffer“We sat down with [Rep.] Jack Kemp [R-N.Y.], [Vice President] Gerald Ford, the Bush family, [Ronald] Reagan and other people, and they said: ‘We'll help you. We believe in this. Just make sure we keep getting elected and we'll roll Roe v. Wade back.’ ...” (Ibid.)What was a moral issue, a religious one, now became political. I am pro-life (ALL life, and for maintaining that life well after birth). I believe abortion on demand is a grievous evil. I have MUCH to question about the actual “pro-life” beliefs of the Bushes, Kemp, Falwell, Reagan, et. al., at the beginning; they obviously didn’t give much of a damn prior to meeting Schaeffer. But their scheme worked. It has taken almost 40 years, but the seed planted by the Moral Majority is showing fruit. The Right now has the chance to overturn Roe. But I recognize that in a kind of twisted way, the adoption of abortion as a moral/political shibboleth (along with gay rights) set the stage for the pursuit of a kind of Christian “sharia law” to be enshrined in our judicial process. Too many people on the right will say they want strict Constitutionalists on the bench, but what they really want are jurists who will interpret the Constitution through the lens of the Bible. Even as a pro-life, if liberal leaning, Independent Christian, this scares the bejesus out of me.*Highly recommended article: Harvard Law Journal concludes: The preborn child is a constitutional personBehind the Scenes: Picturing Fetal RemainsScience Is Giving the Pro-Life Movement a Boost",4.4k,51,144,"1,624",0,5
5,Why are conservatives pro-life?,Pro-Life Movement,Pro-Choice (Stance on Abortion),1!,1!,1!,1!,"Why are conservatives pro-life?Are they, really?If they were for life in the abstract, you’d expect them to oppose the death penalty, yet they are fervent champions of it. You’d also expect them to be pacifists if this were the case, but nobody sports a war boner more quickly than the modern American conservative/reactionary. You’d also expect them to deplore police shootings, but they justify these with depressing regularity.Given these contradictions, it’s hard to say they’re “pro-life”, per se.If they were merely anti-abortion, you’d expect them to support birth control and sex education (both of which are proven to reduce unwanted pregnancy, and the incidence of abortion-seeking) but they are angrily against those things. Instead, they promote “abstinence-only” sex-education, which is proven to result in more unintended pregnancies (and stds, and abortion-seeking) than science-based education and access to birth control.So, when they promote policy that results in young women seeking abortions, when they champion policy that results in innumerable war casualties, when they promote the death penalty and defend police shootings (both of which fall disproportionately on a specific racial demographic), they tell us that they’re concerned with a particular kind of life, and not at all concerned with it more broadly.One conclusion to draw here is that because birth control decouples procreation from sex, that their ‘religious’ opposition to birth control is largely about controlling the sexuality of women. Really, there is no more sought-after commodity than influence over female sexuality in any culture.Another angle to consider is the demographics problem that animates modern right-wingers; that white people are a declining share of the total population (read: electorate) (and in the early years after Roe_v._Wade, the typical abortion seeker was a single young white woman[1]).The fear of an ascendent, nonwhite majority — and the social “regression” that it will inevitably induce — is one of the modern GOP’s animating anxieties. Republicans in the Trump administration and Congress have voiced this fear, explicitly. During the 2016 election, senior White House national security staffer Michael Anton wrote that a Clinton victory would mark the “death” of the United States, because it would lead to “the ceaseless importation of Third World foreigners with no tradition of, taste for, or experience in liberty,” thereby rendering the electorate “more left, more Democratic, less Republican, less republican, and less traditionally American with every cycle.” ~[How the GOP Can Prove It Isn’t a Party for White Supremacists]Granted, the demographics of abortion have changed substantially since then (young white women who don’t want to become pregnant are more likely today to have access to effective birth control than women of color) but that doesn’t change the fact that the white birth rate isn’t high enough to prevent whites from eventually becoming a minority.On different fronts, we have efforts like the Quiverfull [2] movement (which was launched at about the same time as the “Pro-Life” movement was) which is overwhelmingly white and religious, and in some ways explicitly about producing conservative, white future voters.[3]This was our mission. This is how we were to win: Outbreed, Outvote, Outactivate. Every class, every event, every pastor or guest speaker reiterated this, choosing to risk the 501c3 status of their church to push their agenda. To take back the country for Christ, we needed to outbreed, outvote and outactivate the other side, thus saith The Lord.~[I Was Trained for the Culture Wars in Home School, Awaiting Someone Like Mike Pence as a Messiah]At root, the culture wars (which include the ‘pro-life’ and quiverfull movements, and focus heavily on who can vote, and who can immigrate) are fundamentally about the interests their organizers have in “taking back the country for Christ”.That doesn’t mean everyone who doesn’t like abortion is explicitly for a theocratic USA- really, nobody is “pro-abortion” in reality. Even the most ardent pro-choice activists think it should be rare and used as a last resort.The short answer, is politics and demographics. And influence over female sexuality.Footnotes[1] The Demographics of Abortion: It's Not What You Think[2] My Conservative Christian Nightmare: I Spent 16 Years in an Abusive Religious Sect[3] What You Need To Know About The 'Quiverfull' Movement",1.2k,78,2.5k,"2,455",0,9

Remember that Reagan made Nixon’s strategy of switching the Republican party’s voter base from primarily urban to rural. It was determined that rural voters could be made to respond to a wedge issue of abortion. That started the Republican love affair with saving fetuses. Meanwhile, the US infant mortality rate soared and is to this day a scandal that is getting worse; proof that Republicans don’t care about babies; they only care about votes.Abortion is to Republican politics, like “Ring-around-the collar” is to the manufacturers of OxiClean which will lift those stains just like Republicans want to lift votes of naive Christians. Like this pack of pedaphiles and degenerates cares about fetuses. Get a grip.The fact is that politics in this country is sold to people like toothpaste and mouthwash.

We’re so used to having conservatives in this country that we forget they are mostly gone. But let’s go with your question.It was not originally a Republican position. The Eastern Republican Party had little to do with the position that was mostly a Catholic one.Then, in short, the Republicans saw how they could attract more voters (they were theminority party at the time) if they found a way to include Southern Democrats better than the Democrats did. Post-Civil Rights Act.So they did, and along with the Southern Dems came a whole bunch of people who would end up being fundamentalist Christians.Now.The antiabortion position was not originally a Protestant issue. But the preachers saw how it was a real moneymaker if they started to deplore abortion. Their flocks followed them and they began to make lots of money on the new “principle” which can be found in no place in Christian writings.So now all alt-right are antiabortion.",101,3,100,"1,524",0,0

If they were pro-life, they would welcome refugees, fix the immigration process, help the poor instead of demonize them. Healthcare and clean water would be priorities. They wouldn’t have let Puerto Rico go without help.I can’t say they are anti-abortion either. They oppose contraception access (not wanting to pay for it), oppose fact based sex education (immoral), oppose social programs to help struggling families (moochers) and want to keep those private prisons filled. It’s been repeatedly proven that these things will reduce the number of elective abortions. So if it is really about preventing abortions, why don’t they embrace th these policies?Which leaves us with the premise that the “pro life” viewpoint boils down to controlling women and taking away their right to bodily autonomy. That can be cloaked in religious platitudes, as it often is, but the fact remains that a pregnant woman and a fetus cannot have equal rights. If she’s pregnant and doesn’t want to be, whose rights are paramount?The anti-choice rhetoric also keeps their base engaged. We’ve already seen many “pro-life” conservatives who paid for abortions for their mistresses.

Not all “conservatives” are pro-life.

Really strong evidence tends to come from controlled experiments, which real-world economies don’t produce.It is a fact, however, that in the past century, conservative “pro-business” Republican have held full control of the government 3 times. The first time we got the Great Depression, the 2nd time we got the 2008 crash. The 3rd time is off to a good beginning - but then the first two times started well too. I’m betting that we get a similar and maybe worse result this time around.The evidence on financial crises is about as good as you get for looking at results of real-world policies. We had periodic financial crises, then called ‘panics’, through the 19th and early 20th Centuries. Most of these, like the Panics of 1837, 1871, and 1896 are now forgotten, but Wikipedia lists 10 from 1796 to 1907, and the damage they caused at the time was quite serious. After the Depression, the New Deal ushered in an era of financial regulation that led to half a century of unprecedented stability in banking and finance. Reagan had the bright idea of deregulating finance and his first major legislative victory, the Garn-St Germain Act of 1982 led directly to the S&L crisis and bailout a few years later. Republicans had the brilliant insight that the disastrous failure of S & L deregulation meant that more and broader deregulation was just the ticket, and the string of subsequent disasters such as the Long Term Capital Management bailout of 1998, the Asian Crisis of 1997, the Enron failure, the AIG bailout, and the 2008 collapse and massive bank bailout all stem from various deregulatory moves. The recent weakening of Dodd-Frank, which was already dangerously weak as originally passed, is extremely likely to cause another disaster and a big new bailout.

6,How complete and/or total is the historical evidence that Republican economic policies lead to boom and bust cycles that are remedied by subsequent Democrat policies? Is there any evidence or occurrence to the contrary?,Democratic Party vs. Republican Party,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Gary Smith has done a fine job pulling together others political statements published during the 2016 election cycle under the title “Democratic Presidents Manage the Economy Better Than Republicans”. During election cycles, Mark Twain’s adage “Figures don’t lie, but liars do figure”, should cause reporters to vet their sources, as Liars get paid a lot to Lie. Gary, believing a reporter’s work is an integrity issue. If even one report is proven wrong then all such reports are suspect. Please check your facts before publishing more political stories.After checking the following 6 points he quoted from the 2016 Forbes Report, I discovered that the claims in this article are all provably FAKE NEWS based upon FALSE NARRATIVES. Just check the facts using the government source data.The basic FALSE NARRATIVE is the premise that the President, not Congress, should be held accountable for economic health, when Congress holds the purse strings and approves all spending, NOT the President. I therefore compare all of the same government statistics against the Majority Party (or split parties) in power at the time the statistics are generated. The conclusion speaks for itselfPoint #1 – FALSE NARRATIVE - “Politifact truth-o-meter: Stock Market does better under Democratic Presidents than Republican Presidents”… Just read their article, Politifact’s truth-o-meter Article has expressed their opinion that the stock market is irrelevant.What does this mean? This is FAKE NEWS.Point #2 – FALSE NARRATIVE – “Nine of the last ten recessions have occurred under Republican Presidents.” First, the Quora article is based on quotes from a Forbes article, which shows multiple charts covering the “President” not “Congress” as the measure (False Narrative). The Job Growth chart shows that the Charts are based upon the Presidential terms from Truman (1945) to 2016. All statistics quoted from the Forbes Report must be based upon the same 70 years. For purposes of updating, I included 2017, which makes negligible differences in the other statistical outcomes.What does this mean? There were 12 recessions, not 10 recessions during this period. The 12 recessions started under Congress’s House and Senate, as 9 were fully Democrat controlled, 2 were split party controlled and 1 was fully Republican controlled. The statistics were cherry-picked, removing the first 2 Democratic governed recessions for the total.Point #3 – FALSE NARRATIVE – “Democratic presidents create nearly twice as many jobs per year as Republican Presidents.” Congress makes the jobs, not the president. Counting jobs does not account for the current employment rate. There will be fewer jobs created once an economy is in full swing. The proper statistic is the Unemployment Rate. However, IF jobs are to be counted then the percentage of new public versus private-enterprise jobs tells the story of government’s prior failure to fix the economy.What does this mean? The average unemployment rate is: 5.55% for fully Democrat controlled Congress; 4.70% for fully Republican controlled Congress; and 7.41% for split control of Congress. On average, 18% more unemployment under the Democrats and the split Congress created 41% more unemployment than the average of both parties.Point #4 – FALSE NARRATIVE – “Republican presidents' deficits are 25% larger than Democrats' and 63% higher as a percent of GDP.” Deficits by themselves have little meaning. Deficits must be compared to the GDP, which is why the Deficit/GDP ratio is published, as a percentage.What does this mean? The average annual Deficit/GDP is as follows: 2.48% for fully Democrat controlled Congress; 0.44% for fully Republican controlled Congress; and 4.00% for split control of Congress. On average, a 465% greater Deficit/GDP ratio under the Democrats compared to Republicans and the split Congress created 274% more unemployment than the both-parties average.Point #5 – FALSE NARRATIVE – “GDP grows 44% faster under Democratic Presidents..” The average annual % GDP Growth Rate is as follows: 2.86% for fully Democrat controlled Congress; 3.14% for fully Republican controlled Congress; and 2.60% for split control of Congress.What does this mean? On average, 10% more annual % GDP Growth Rate under the Republicans, while the split Congress created 13% less annual GDP Growth Rate than the both-parties average. This also means that within a single 8-year Presidential term, with a Republican Congressional majority, the GDP could have grown 22% larger over the 72-year study period if Congress were under Republican control.Point #6 – FALSE NARRATIVE – “Business investment has grown twice as fast under Democratic Presidents than under Republican Presidents” The average annual Business Investment (1945 – 2017) (in Billions) is as follows: $193.41 Billion for fully Democrat controlled Congress; $628.17 Billion for fully Republican controlled Congress; and $489.87 Billion for split control of Congress.What does this mean? On average, 325% more annual Business Investment under the Republicans and the split Congress created 19% more annual Business Investment than the average of both parties.Conclusion?

Such a doctor who refused to care for a gay person would be endangering their own soul, similarly if they did something to explicitly endorse homosexual sex like celebrate a gay wedding this too would be a sin and to force them to do so is tyranny.

5,When will Robert Mueller’s investigation produce a guilty plea on a meaningful charge instead of all theses meaningless charges?,U.S. Special Counsel Investigation (2017-present),1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Meaningless, you say?Money laundering for a foreign power is a meaningless charge? Lying to the FBI is a meaningless charge? Acting as an undisclosed agent of a foreign power is a meaningless charge?None of the indictments issued by Mueller so far are small potatoes, at least as far as those facing them are concerned - ultimately, there’s going to be a lot of jail time involved, along with asset seizures. It’s true: so far the charges have only been laid at the feet of some of the outliers of the Trump Campaign, but we also know that several of those thus indicted have bargained for a plea deal with Mueller.That in itself is suggestive of several things:First off, it indicates that Mueller isn’t overly interested in people like Gates, Flynn and Manafort: he’s looking to go higher up the food chain, likely looking at the actions of Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and perhaps even Donald Trump himself. The indictments are clear evidence of wrongdoing, and they’ll pay for their actions, but the plea bargains suggest that they have information pertinent to Mueller.It needs to be noted that the methodology that Mueller is using is similar to that used by the FBI to deal with mob bosses: you start with the small guys at the bottom of the pyramid, charge them for their offenses, but offer them deals for leniency if they co-operate by handing over incriminating material on their superiors. Slowly, you build up a case against the guys at the top of the pyramid: all built on the backs of the little guys.It’s certainly true that we’ve yet to see charges leveled against Kushner, Trump Jr. and others higher up in the Trump Campaign, but that isn’t to say that those aren’t coming - at present, Mueller seems to be working on getting Trump himself to testify (which would speed the investigation along considerably), but there’s no doubt that Mueller has more to serve up yet.It’s also worth noting that Mueller has issued a significant number of indictments compared to other investigations against high-profile political figures, and has done so in a rather short space of time. A year might seem like a long period, but in terms of these types of investigations, it’s not overly significant - the Watergate investigation took more than two years before it gained any results!Also, just for reference, obtaining a guilty plea isn’t the point of any investigation: the idea behind that is to obtain sufficient evidence that will convince a jury that misconduct has taken place, regardless of what the defendant pleads. Trump, for example, can claim his innocence until he’s blue in the face (if such is possible with so much orange spray tan!), but that doesn’t mean that he is actually innocent. Mueller’s final report to Congress (and the evidence attached to it) will give a fair indication on that score, and it’ll then be up to Congress to determine the guilt or innocence of the President.Be patient: Mueller’s not done yet. You can guarantee that there’ll be more charges and indictments to come, but given that the targets are fairly likely to be higher up the food-chain than Gates, Manafort, Papadopoulos and Flynn, it’s fair to say that Mueller needs to make sure that the evidence is utterly incontrovertible before going after those he’s looking at.",12.1k,389,1.4k,"1,929",0,0

Somehow this has become “meaningless” to many right wingers. But let’s leave that for a moment. Why did he plead guilty and agree to cooperate with the investigation in the first place?The answer is that the prosecution convinced him and his attorneys that they had a very strong case on more serious charges and were almost certainly going to get a conviction. That’s the deal. The prosecution gets cooperation with the investigation, and the defendant gets to plead to a lesser charge with a smaller penalty.So what were the more serious charges? In general, we don’t know. Plea deals are between the prosecution and the defense and are not (AFAIK) generally made public. There’s a strong suspicion that in Flynn’s case they involved violations of FARA, particularly because the statement of offenses filed included both making false statements to the FBI and making “materially false statements and omissions” in document filings required by FARA.But the idea that “all Mueller got” is the lesser charges to which Flynn, Papadopolous, and Gates pled guilty is a serious misrepresentation of events.

We can assume the original list of crimes in every plea deal was even bigger than what we are seeing.Example, a plea deal discussion:Mueller’s Team: “Mr. Flynn, take a look at this — we have clear evidence of you committing SERIOUS CRIME A, which means up to 60 years in prison. We also have clear evidence of you committing SERIOUS CRIME B, which is an automatic 45 years in prison.Mueller’s Team: “Mr. Flynn, We also have evidence of you committing three smaller crimes, MINOR CRIME C, and MINOR CRIME D, and MINOR CRIME E. Those are only 5, and 7, and 8 years in prison.”Mueller’s Team: “Mr. Flynn, Look over all this evidence. Plus, we have more, but that is our own secret. We won’t tell you what all that is. But, we have even more. Now, look over all that evidence in front of you.”Mueller’s Team: “So, Mr. Flynn — do you want to plead guilty to MINOR CRIME C, and MINOR CRIME D, and MINOR CRIME E? —If you do, you will agree to stop lying, and tell us everything, no exceptions, no holding back, one minor boo-boo, and the whole deal is off. If you do, we will drop the two SERIOUS CRIMES. And we will only indict for the three MINOR CRIMES, and we can also ask the judge to be lenient, and these minor crimes might be concurrent sentences, and you might get out of prison in 6 years, instead of 125 years.”That, is a very typical plea bargain. And, you and I will never probably know what all of those other crimes were. Not the “Major Crimes.”This happens every day, and not just at the federal level. It happens in your own town, just to avoid expensive trials, and to avoid the risk of losing at a trial, and having a guilty person walk free.It also happens in a large investigation, to gather new evidence of others who were involved in a conspiracy.

Ultimately, they’re looking at the next Presidential election: for the moment, Trump seems to be a solid incumbent candidate (though I’d argue that the GOP has some much better alternatives), but if Mueller’s gathered evidence that would undermine Trump, they need to know about it. They don’t want to see Trump put forward as their nominee for 2020 if it’s apparent that he’s engaged in serious illegal conduct against the United States. That’d be a guaranteed way to lose.What would change if the Republicans maintain a majority in House and Senate is what would happen once Mueller issued his report. Let’s be blunt: if it shows what many suspect - in that Trump engaged in inappropriate or criminal behaviour in order to win a Presidential election - the Democrats would do their damnedest to see him gone from office. That means impeachment by the House and conviction by the Senate. Realistically, though, that’s not going to happen.The November Midterms are presently pointing to the Democrats taking the House, but not being likely to take the Senate. That makes impeachment possible, but conviction unlikely - thus, Trump would remain President until 2020 regardless, unless he chose to resign his office.Mueller’s investigation wraps up when he presents his report to Rod Rosenstein, who will then hand that over to Congress. It’s completely out of their hands thereafter, because it’s up to Congress to decide what action should be taken. If it’s a Republican-controlled Congress, it’s doubtful they will act on it, but it will change how they approach the 2020 election. If it’s a Democratic-controlled Congress, impeachment would be on the cards, but it’s an open question as to how far that would go.Ultimately, Mueller will conclude his investigation. Trump and his lawyers are certainly battling to stop that happening - and that’s a pretty clear indication that it needs to keep going, as far as I’m concerned. Something has them worried, and that’s fairly suggestive. It’s clear that Trump does not want Mueller to submit a report to Congress (via Rosenstein), which suggests that there might be something sufficiently juicy among the evidence to turn even the Republican Party against him.Yes, I will concede that it’s possible that Trump is innocent and just wants the investigation closed without resolution because he is innocent, but that strikes me as a little off. If he were innocent, the evidence should bear that out, and Mueller would simply exonerate him. Trump’s working too hard to discredit Mueller, and that to me suggests something more sinister at work.Nothing, however, is going to happen to Mueller: the investigation will proceed (with or without Trump’s testimony), and Mueller will file his final report and walk away, job done. It’ll be up to Congress to act at that point - and whether they will do anything or not remains to be seen. By and large, all will depend on whether support of Trump will be damaging to the Republican Party once Mueller’s report is filed. It may well be that they’ll back him to the end or it may well be that they burn him in order to save themselves.Really hard to say which is the case until we know what Mueller has.",4.1k,50,1.4k,"1,929",0,0

For example, in July, we shall see a trial for Paul Manafort. In September, we shall see a second trial for Paul Manafort. The same will be true for each and every person surrounding the dude in the Oval Office. The Congress has nothing to do with that.At the end of the investigation, Mueller’s team will turn in their report.Based upon that, it is possible that it will reveal similar crimes on the part of the dude in the Oval Office. It is also possible that it will NOT reveal similar crimes on the part of the dude in the Oval Office.If it DOES reveal evidence of crimes on the part of Donald Trump, at that stage, the House would have to decide what to do. They may do nothing, They may do something.

No harm, no foul!”)But, if Mueller lays out clear evidence of “Obstruction of Justice,” then it may depend on what he did to Obstruct Justice.But, if Mueller lays out clear evidence of Money Laundering? It may come down to why money was laundered, and how many times, and how many dollars…But, if Mueller lays out clear evidence of Conspiracy Against the US? Gulp. That gets mighty tough for any Congress to pretend to look the other way…(That is one of the charges again Paul Manafort, and also against Gates, in his original indictment.)If it is Bank Fraud (some have been indicted for that). Who knows?If it is Tax Fraud? Who knows?And, it may come down to how many different charges, for how many different crimes, and how much money is involved, and at what point does each member of Congress start to feel like their voters will not forgive their “perfidy.”Nobody knows what the magical tipping point would be.Reminder: The House might choose to bring charges of impeachment. They would then vote.IF that vote passes, then the Senate is required to hold a sort of a trial. But, when the Senate votes, the result must be 2/3 majority. That is a high bar.

But so far, we have no crime other than ones not associated with the campaign.It is possible the Mueller investigation will end not with a bang but with a whimper.But let's suppose that a crime as discovered, and there is sufficient evidence to charge somebody. The Mueller investigation will end with a recommendation. If that recommendation is to go forward, you need about 60% of the American population behind it.Without the public sentiment, you can't expect an impeachment. The public polling is solidly split, and there's a majority of people who think that Trump is not being treated fairly by the media. If there is actual prosecutorial misconduct found in the IG report, it will become impossible to secure an impeachment, much less conviction.In that event, I would expect Mueller to wrap up his work and complete any leftover items by the first of the year. So, much of the prediction depends on what is found in the IG report, which I expect within 10 days.",229,1,677,"6,738",0,0

It was not taking a position for a classical Monarch so much as a modern Royal Family like the Brits have.Essentially a ceremonial figurehead and a support structure. Ones we could obsess over and personalize as familiars.Super Celebrities.We already have those. For the life of me I can’t figure out why but we do. The Kardashians, “Branjelina”, Beyoncé, Michael Jackson and Elvis.Tellingly, the British Royals are actually more popular here than they are there. So in a sense we already have them.Many Brits will, quite vocally, tell you the monarchy needs to be abolished as a silly and unnecessary expense. Often countered with their value as one of the world’s great tourist attractions.Yet the very concept of a hereditary monarch is completely inadequate for governing a massive super power. No matter how competent the line proves it’s eventually going to spit out a turd. Charles the Second or Mad King George were pretty solid examples considering we fought the revolutionary war to get rid of the Monarchs of the British Empire.Queen Elizabeth has been a solid monarch. Charles seems like a decent guy but he was never as popular as Lady Diana. Their kids seem solid and worthy of dragging this system out but how long until an awkward incompetent is the next in line?Who in America would really qualify?The Kennedy Clan came pretty close to being the default royals but while everyone kind of likes Jack and Bobby, Ted drove half the country batty.Next up are the Bush Family. Two Presidents, a Governor, an entertainment reporter, Dubya’s utterly likable daughters. They’ve also spawned a thousand conspiracy videos on YouTube.Queen Chelsea? That would very like kill 5% of the population from fatal apoplexy.Egad can you image Kim and Kanye as Co-Regents? The Midwest might promptly secede.Yuck, Donald Trump Jr. as the crowned Prince? Or would Ivanka get elevated above her brother? We’ve never elected a Jewish President, how about as monarchs? The Neo NAZIs go full on riot insane.Maybe Bill Gates or Warren Buffet? Super Rich guys might do for our hyper-capitalist tendencies; but wouldn’t that eventually lead to super-monopolies where the American Emperor owned virtually everything?Lets keep something in mind. Americans always disagree. Even when it’s something we actually agree on, at least 1% of the population will either go full troll or at least play devils advocate.Even someone utterly likable, like Tom Hanks and his charming wife and affable son would get some hate if we crowned him an autocrat.We don’t have Kings for the simplest of reasons. George Washington didn’t want the title. Like so many other things, he set a very good example for what a good American actually looks like. Before looking for a monarch, go back and read some of Washington’s letters. He was possibly the last American that virtually everyone was united behind, devoid of politics. Washington warned us about the dangers of political parties and we didn’t listen it might be a good idea to think on his other bits of advice considering our divisive politics is exactly why Washington disliked parties.",211,2,275,"1,377",0,0

In Western Europe - and in many locations in Eastern Europe - this inherited leadership consolidated power and wealth in the hands of a few (through birth) and a few more (through a mix of merit and birth). Similar patterns of consolidation show up in complex societies in Africa, Asia, and South and Central America.Much of the underlying premise behind the US Declaration of Independence and the US Constitution is a rejection of inherited leadership. This is why the US has such a strong myth cycle for the self-made man (or woman) who rises from poverty and ignorance to become a military, industrial, academic, or political leader.It’s also why there’s such a consistent narrative about the second- and third-generations, as they sink back into mediocrity.Our myths don’t really honor inherited power - at least, not now.

3,The National Review Magazine claims that liberals want to ban Republicans as too deplorable for political society. What do you think of the claim?,Liberalism (politics),Republican Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"When George W Bush was President, conservatives such as Rush Limbaugh screamed that liberals wanted him to fail, even if it hurt the country. It was ridiculous, but when Obama became President, Limbaugh and other conservatives openly said that they hoped he would fail, even if it was bad for the country, while Senate Majority Leader McConnell announced that keeping Obama from being re-elected was his number one priority, rather than the well-being of Americans or the security of our nation.When Barack Obama was running for President, Sarah Palin derided him as nothing but a celebrity. Eight years later, she was a major supporter of Donald Trump, a celebrity with no government experience.For decades, conservatives have taken surveys showing that most journalists are Democrats as proof that the news is biased against them. I have rarely seen actual evidence that these journalists let their politics influence their reporting, but when conservatives get control of news outlets—cf. Fox News and Sinclair Broadcasting—they often turn the news programming into a soapbox for their own viewpoints.Many conservatives put forth conspiracy theories—the science fiction writer Orson Scott Card had a particularly nasty and racist one, although he disingenuously said that he didn't believe it, really—suggesting that Barack Obama was making plans to remain in the White House after his term expired by various illegal means. But it has been the Republicans trying to subvert the democratic process with a variety of means to suppress the vote.Republicans repeatedly claimed that the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare, was rammed through with no time for discussion and no chance for Republicans to have any input. That was, at best, hugely exaggerated—but the Republican changes to the ACA were done in exactly that way.In short, if there is a conservative claiming that liberals want to ban conservatives, you can bet that he, and probably some of his colleagues, want to ban liberals. Whether they are trying to make the accusation just so when people hear that they are doing it, some will think liberals did it first, or they are just assuming that liberals would do the same nasty things they would, is harder to say.The article's only example is that a private company which helps political candidates raise money decided not to raise money for any Republicans. To go from ""we don't want to help raise money to elect you"" to ""we want to ban you from society"" is a ridiculous leap. I can't believe that the author actually believes that.",1.4k,74,68,168,0,0

3,The National Review Magazine claims that liberals want to ban Republicans as too deplorable for political society. What do you think of the claim?,Liberalism (politics),Republican Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"The National Review is a founding element of the GOP Deep State, beginning in 1960 with the Sharon Statement, the manifesto and organizing principles of William F. Buckley’s Young Americans for Freedom, the crypto-Nazi farm team that nurtures career political activists for the Conservative/Tea Party coalition in the GOP. The National Review is a vanity publication that depended upon Buckley’s inherited wealth in the beginning to stay on the news stands. The crypto-Nazis this political movement generated got a boost from the Goldwater campaign, which offered safe haven for the Joe McCarthy demagogues until the Nixon Plumbers gave them a base of operations from within the West Wing and managed to cross the line into unconstitutional and criminal activism.The second element of the GOP Deep State began to form in 1968 with the migration of the hard-core white bigots from the Democrat party that George Wallace shook loose with his neo-Dixiecrat presidential campaign. By 1972, this migration was nearly complete.The third element was the Evangelical coalition that came to the GOP with Reagan. This element is a little difficult to separate from the Wallace migration, but Jimmy Carter managed to accelerate its formation in time for Reagan.The fourth element is the criminal agenda associated with Donald T. Regan, his son-in-law David A. Lefeve, and Charles Z. and Paul Thayer of LTV. Paul Thayer was a loose cannon who violated the optics of propriety of the Deep State, that is, his insider trading with his mistress caused his essentially unlawful associations to be compromised while he was in a public office.John Kasich is the model of apparent propriety: he came to Congress, did the dirty work he was employed to accomplish on the straight and narrow, then left Congress and went to Wall Street, where he received his payoff, the delayed gratification Paul Thayer took too early. Kasich is now trying to get back into the national spotlight as the latter day choir boy who is shocked, SHOCKED! by the blatant self-serving agenda of the Trumpsters, assuming that the rest of the world has forgotten how he, Kasich, build his career on ending other people’s career as an early adopter of Grover Norquist’s “starve the beast” agenda.Donald T. Regan is another example of the apparent propriety of the GOP Deep State. When he left Merrill Lynch for Treasury, he put his assets in a blind trust and acted as if it was actually a blind trust.But, given how trusts actually work, the Secretary of Treasury can manipulate the economy to enrich his holdings in his trust pretty directly, which is exactly what he did. Regan routinely, as in daily, manipulated markets as Treasury Secretary and, when he became Reagan’s Chief of Staff, he was able to exploit Reagan’s growing cognitive disability to advance his agenda until Nancy realized what he was doing and fired his ass. However, this agenda persists and, in the fullness of time, the Russian investigation will expose the conspiracy between these players in the GOP Deep State (which now includes the cohort Cheney brought into the mix with the invasion of Iraq) and the Russian Dark Web that hacked the election in favor of any conservative candidate and to the disadvantage of Clinton in particular.Russia is not the monolith the Clinton Russian narrative portrays and Putin was not part of the cyber-attack against the United States launched by the Russian Dark Web, which is composed of enemies not just of Putin but of all constitutional authorities globally, Putin conducted a sting with Swedish Interpol against these elements in the Russian Dark Web that began before the 2016 election and was sprung in 2017.Putin was able to identify his adversaries and, as near as I can tell, he will trigger a purge against them by Bastille Day. When he pulls the trigger, it will light up the GOP Deep State for Mueller in a way he has never been able to accomplish in the past. The Paradise Papers provide a glimpse into this community of criminal and subversive activity, but Putin will connect the dots into the GOP’s political apparatus in regards to money laundering, Wall Street hedge funds (such as Nina Rosenwald’s American Securities hedge fund that John Bolton is trying to protect by dismantling the Cyber-Security office from the National Security apparatus), and Citizens United.The irony, of course, is that Trump’s collusion with Putin before 2015 to stage the Miss Universe Pageant will tend to put him beyond the peril of RICO and the GOP Deep State. That’s why Giuliani is working so hard to get all of Trump’s false narratives exposed as false narratives. The object is to demonstrate Trump’s association with the Sovereign Democracy agenda Putin inherited from Nixon-Brezhnev “Detente” by way of Gorbachev and Yeltsin as mitigating evidence for Mueller’s consideration.The National Review might not be so lucky.",130,2,394,"1,072",0,0

It would have justified Newt Gingrich’s politics of personal destruction agenda even before Trump was elected. Moral equivalence: we’re all whores and we’re all covered in shit.That’s straight out of the bad theology of John Piper. It’s a big money maker. If Obama had pardoned Democrat Rod Blagojevich for the moral equivalence of making Scott Pruit the head of EPA and Devos the head of Education and Ross the head of Commerce and Trump’s favorite lawnjockey, Ben Carson (with Clarence Thomas, it makes a matched set for bookends), impoverished Evangelical pastors wouldn’t have to make empassioned pleas for Dessault Falcon 7 jets, the preferred fuck-and-fly ride for the Cannes-Tel Aviv set. I mean, Trump is the answer to their pleas for a divine demonstration of their prosperity gospel based on their “Salvation” gospel for all those people covered in shit who pay John Piper to cleanse them in the blood of Jesus and bathe them in the Living Waters of the Jordan.In other words, it would have been a huge windfall for the GOP Deep State. It is part of the standard compensation package for career crypto-Nazi activists in the GOP Deep State to be hooked in to legal cash flows from largely anonymous sources.

But we no longer find good men like Senator Boren who are moderate amongst the Democrats.Such votes are now less likely to happen. First, it used to be a legitimate question to ask as to what the difference was to either party. There is now a big difference with the Democrats seeming to have lost all their intelligence heading downward in a liberal spiral. Where is the budget restrain? Actually that is a question for either party, but Democrats seem to think any program that sounds good is deserving of funding. Folks, we are broke and daddy needs to tell the kids they can’t have any more candy for awhile. Anyone who continues to support the Democrats needs to truly question how long this nation can support their agenda. I am beginning to agree that liberalism is a mental disorder.The party’s have become so polarized that neither will vote for a bill from the other party if they think it makes the other side look good. So, this brings us why it might be better to vote for a party instead of the person. If I perceive the Democratic person to be more in-line with my thinking, they will nevertheless be voting for Nancy Pelosi (or another liberal) to be Speaker of the House. The majority determines who heads committees. I don’t want to chance losing control of either body by voting Democrat in my local race. There are just too many Democratic nut-jobs who I prefer to keep as Ranking Member instead of Chairman.I have never, in 12 Presidential elections, never voted Democratic.

From George Washington‘s warning to avoid foreigntwr entanglements to the present America Firsters, distrust of foreigners is a constant.Similarly, ideas of foreign origin are met with hostility. Just look at the hysteria that the mere mention of Sharia law evokes. Even on the Supreme Court there are those who reject any citation to foreign law as persuasive precedent. The United States is sui generis and superiorSocialism is a foreign idea born in 19fh Century Europe as an answer to the alienatiôn and displacements of the Industrial Revolution and the reactionary governments of the post Napoleonic age. In 1848 a wave of revolt sîmilar to the Arab Spring erupted across Europe. It was just as futile as the Arab Spring but it gave rise to the widespread dissemination of socialist ideas. The most prominent document was the Communist Manifesto. But Communism as envisioned by Karl Marx was not the Leninist-Stalinist regime of the Soviet Union. Communism for Marx was the end product of a long historical process and almost Utopian. Before the Leninists coopted the label Communist, it applied to a broad range of models.The Social Democrats and the more radical group that ultimately were called Communists originally tried to work together but it became clear that the gradualist Social Democrats who believed in working within existing structures to change them and the radical Communists who advocated violent means to overthrow the existing order were incompatible and they secered ties acrimoniously. In Russia it was the split between the Bolsheviks led by Leninand the Mensheviks led by Kerensky.In the United States, social democracy was met with abhorrence. It went contrary to Rugged Individualism and thus was un American. No effort was made to distinguish moderate social democrats from fanatical Anarchists and Communists. It was all Socialism which was the enemy of the Capitalism that was the American ideological system.Think of the mockery and scorn heaped on Hillary Clinton for her advocacy of the idea that “It takes a village” or on Barack Obama for pointing out that no successful person ever made it completely on their own without the work of others.Social democracy answers the question “Am I my brither’s keeper?” with a “Yes.”",42,0,21,159,0,0

1,Why are the Republicans who stand up to Trump the ones who are retiring?,Republican Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"I agree with the beginning of Nathaniel’s reply—that they are getting out because they are ahead of the curve, but I don’t know why he beers off into a point about ‘that a member of the Trump family is the president’—my paraphrase because i can’t read his reply and answer the question using the app—but that issue should stand aside for now.Secondly, let’s be clear here—i don’t think that they are ‘retiring’ to relax on their wealth and power and not play a role in politics going forward. They have lucrative positions lined up as lobbyists, pundits, and organizational leaders (in politics and business), so let’s dispense with the ‘retiring’ label here.Why leave public office now? Well, as someone who has ‘grown up’ with President Trump (in that I’m in NY), I know that his brand of populism is a reaction to the fact that the word is a complicated place and I t seems to be a common interest today to want to ignore that fact and seek easy—even binary—answers that totally ignore it. Anyone who pitches easy answers and paints in broad, binary-only colors will be supported by those who want to ignore that fact—and that’s where Trump succeeds. To a complicated world he says ‘just ignore that an listen to my easy answers and things will be less-complicated and less scary.’However, such reductionist thinking in the just of “there is only two sides, I’m totally right and you’re totally wrong, etc”—is a short-term position becasuee it only appears to be a solution and the real world will have none of that. It will quickly remind you of such fantastica thinking in very nasty ways. So, make no mistake—that reckoning is coming.So in summary, I think a little bit of foresight does those R’s who are ‘retiring’ good because they can get out while they are ahead and make plenty of easy money as lobbyists and pundits. Because after all, it’s easier to criticize that create, as the current crop of Congressperosns are (re)discovering once again. When the simple answers fail—ans they will—someone will be held accountable and they know that being on the outside looking for that accountable person is a better place to be than where they are now.",49,0,7,30,0,0

3,How many of you would support a new third hybrid party based on the best values from Democrats and Republicans?,Democratic Party vs. Republican Party,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"I am afraid that currently the ‘best’ values of both parties are antithetical to each other. And the most important values seem to override each party’s best values.The first line of the 2016 Republican Party Platform, adopted at the Republican Convention says:“We believe in American exceptionalism”. If all of their party planks are resting on this self-serving, self-centered, insulting attitude, it puts a very negative slant on all of their values.The Democrats certainly talk a better talk in their platform but their voting records show that their desire to get re-elected all too often causes them to abandon their ideals and take the easy way out and not fight hard to inspire us to support those ideals and move us to a better place. In addition, the Democrats, with the exception of a few, certainly give lip service and support to the idea of American exceptionalism.As to places where values can be debated; when I taught sixth graders and we discussed government and political parties I used the example of the debate about the federal government instituting a school lunch program in public schools many years ago. Putting the best spin on it for both parties, I put it this way. The Democrats realized that hungry kids were not at their best for the job of learning. They also recognized the disparity between families who had enough time and money to properly feed their children and families that struggled to do so. I characterized the Republican position as concern that the government’s taking over the responsibility of parents to provide a lunch for their children to take to school would actually weaken the family by allowing a different entity to take over a family responsibility.A show of hands said that the kids all recognized the strength of both positions. Another show of hands on how they would vote on the issue had them passing the school lunch bill by a sizable majority on the grounds that ultimately the most important thing was to not let kids go hungry. A few students held out for trying to keep the family strong. But all the kids recognized that both sides had good reasons for their positions.Trying to merge ideals is very difficult but you have to start with people who understand and respect competing priorities.

Conservatives would find me “liberal” in some respects and Liberals would find me “conservative” in other respects.Anyway when I have heard this term used it is usually in regard to socialism. by Americans who think my country, even when ruled by the right wing National party is socialist.Personally after spending all Friday in doctors and then the hospital with my 91 year old mother after a fall I think you would be brainless not to appreciate the health care my country offers everyone. The grand sum total of cost was $45 dollars as it was an accident.Now I will say a conservative will argue that we pay for that in our taxes and in our Accident compensation but nevertheless our health care proportion of taxes is less expensive than the USA.We don’t have a hugely inefficient administration system. Medical billing is not a career track here.So instead of trying to get my mother out of hospital because of the cost, I was trying to get her out of hospital because she was bored out of her brain.My father was a left winger. It’s rather insulting to assume he had not thought through his beliefs. Being affected by the great depression in 1926 had a lot to do with it.By the way being socialist does not mean being unenterprising.

That the welfare state was a safety net not a cushion.Dad took so little time off work in sick leave that he received an award. His reasoning was that it was a right that had been fought for and he was not going to abuse it.I don’t see the point of having a society where there is no co-operation at all. Socialism is not Communism and a good hospital system is in practice run more efficiently by the government.It’s in everyone's interests that people are educated at a good level.Slums breed crime.I do believe in people who are able being encouraged to work rather than sitting on the benefit but the Conservatives in the United States carry this to extremes.This question is flawed.",301,5,86,330,0,0

I do not believe or think that it is possible to describe a person as a political belief, thus “being a liberal”, “being a conservative”, is not a description that I can use to describe a human.So what we can describe? Well we can describe a human with certain political view. And the difference between describing a human identified with a political belief and describing the political view(s) of a human, is not a simple semantic difference. When you define a human, as a political belief, such becomes a dogma that defines human, but when you define a person’s political view(s), it describes philosophical readings of that human about some social issues, based on political ideas.In short, I have readings of several political issues, that can be described belonging to this or that political thinking system. All of the following are in European context: For example I am quite conservative about sovereign rights of nation states, emigrants’ rights, some types of crimes and management of natural resources. On the other hand I am liberal about civil rights, autonomy of universities, utility management regulations. I am socialist about social security, health, and basic education services. etc. etc. Some of them can be conflicting in rough reading from the outside, but I think I can convince you for most of my views, especially if you are from a civilised country and can spend some days to talk over these.Also while the question is implying it is expected to see some change in political views, it is a very limited scope of flexibility for my expectation to be able to change my political views, only once while changing from being young to being old.

Amusing, but far from true.I have always been a liberal. And the older I get the more liberal I become.The basic tenet of Liberalism is that All people are created equal, and are endowed by their creator with inalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness… and that government exists solely to protect those rights.And what that means is that we, as a society, are dedicated to being sure that everyone enjoys equally the fruits of civilization.

The McCarthy era was all about destroying liberalism. Communism was just a ruse to destroy intellectualism, education, and the pursuit of something better than rampant capitalism.

They no longer wanted to see black students and white students segregated by race, or drink for separate water fountains. The conservatives in their day strongly opposed this point of view and so it was the liberals who were proponents of things like Brown v Board of Education.Brown v. Board of Education - Black History - HISTORY.comHere were the conservatives during this time, opposing the liberals.""It's Being Black and Poor"": Race, Class, and Desegregation at Pebblebrook HighNow, those liberals may very well be our conservatives voters today. But that does not mean that they totally regressed backwards.You won’t see very many of the proponents of desegregation changing their minds today. They haven’t regressed to trying to bring segregation back to America.Instead the goal posts have simply changed. Today, being liberal means things like supporting gay rights. And if those people who supported desegregation in the past are not able to adjust to supporting gay marriage today, this can make them a conservative.However, it is because the qualifier for liberalism has changed, not because these individuals changed their mind on their former liberal policies. Desegregation is accepted as the norm now, it’s no longer liberal to believe that black people should have equal rights so we no longer see this point of view as a ‘liberal’ one.Today I consider myself a social liberal. I support things like gay rights and the ability for transgender people to transition. Fifty years from now, liberals may be discussing and fighting for changes that I never once considered were equality issues.I may or may not jump on the bandwagon, there’s no way for me to say. I might still be a liberal and wind up supporting the liberals. Or, I might dig my heels in and claim that the new generation of liberals are destroying America. I can’t predict what rights issues will be tackled in fifty years and I’m sure that the liberals fifty years ago didn’t oftentimes stop to think that gay rights were ever going to become a thing.How many conservatives today would genuinely argue that we should bring back Jim Crow and segregation? How many would genuinely argue black people should be slaves again? How many would genuinely argue women should be confined to the home, or not be allowed to vote? How many would genuinely argue marital rape should once again be legalized? How many would genuinely argue that interracial marriage should not be allowed?That’s because those are issues that the liberals won. You may look back on those policies and think that of course you would never support such a thing, because those things were immoral or wrong or oppressed innocent people. But the conservatives in those days were simply protecting and fighting for the commonly held morals and traditions of their time. To them, the idea that a black and white person could marry was absurd and disturbed the moral fabric of society. Think of the children!ABC’s What Would You Do carried out a social experiment on interracial relationships and we could see the difference in opinion over generational lines. These much older women were still very much the product of their time:And I guarantee you decades from now someone may write a post just like me and on it they are going to ask ‘how many of you would genuinely argue that gay people should not be allowed to get married?’ and the conservatives in that day and age are going to have the same reaction you just did. “I’d never support such a thing! That was wrong!”That’s because proponents of gay rights are going to win. The reaction you had to proponents of segregation are going to be the same reactions people are going to have about the opponents of gay marriage today. Social liberals are changing the goal posts, we’re changing the attitudes and traditions and morals of society.The things conservatives fought for fifty years ago probably don’t resemble what conservatives are fighting for today. You may think you are ‘conserving’ morals but in reality you are conserving the present day morals, the ones reshaped by liberals. Perhaps once a long time ago, you were that social liberal who managed to reshape our modern values. Did you march for civil rights? Did you participate in the sexual revolution? Did you fight for women’s equality in the workplace? Did you celebrate when marital rape became illegal?When liberals win the ethics of society change with them.Young, modern day liberals have to understand that many of the conservatives today were just like us in the past. Conservative women today once helped pave the way for me to be able to have equality in the workplace. Conservative men today signed laws that allowed me access to contraception. Modern day conservative men and women paved the way for me to have an interracial relationship. They were the liberals back then.But no, I don’t believe this quote is accurate. Supporting women’s rights in the 1970s does not lead to the logical conclusion of opposing gay rights today, these are not mutually exclusive.It’s more than possible for someone to have been liberal in the past and adapt to liberalism today. Or maybe they were an ultra-liberal back then and were always on board with gay rights. There’s no reason why wanting to halt progress after your time is the logical conclusion of growing older.There may be some arguments around things like economic policy and becoming fiscally conservative when you are older. But if someone is socially liberal and fiscally conservative that doesn’t mean that they are a ‘conservative’, it just means that they have a blend of different policies. A liberal in my opinion is both socially and economically liberal. A conservative is both socially and economically conservative. Someone who is a blend of both may lean to one side or the other or they might simply be a centrist.So to me, the answer is no. There is no reason it is more practical to become both socially and economically conservative as one grows older. If we follow the progression of various social movements in society it makes sense there were people who fought for women’s rights and civil rights and now gay rights, there’s no reason they had to stop after one success.",4.3k,107,4.9k,"4,715",1,2

And then as a young man, I knew integration was correct when I came to Singapore, a place where they have socially engineered the population not to segregate into their own racial, religious and cultural silo.

This is a source of a lot of political claptrap in this country, from “nuclear power is horribly unsafe” on the left to “gay people are paedos” on the right.And a third, for the most conscious and thoughtless users of the phrase, is that “Democrat Party” is not the actual name of the Party, the phrase irritates the members thereof, and there really is nothing in American politics more purely mean-spirited and petty than a dedicated conservative on a rant.",69,2,45,73,0,0
2,Why do many conservatives refer to the Democratic Party as the Democrat Party?,Democratic Party vs. Republican Party,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"From conservatives, particular Republicans, it’s meant as an anti-Democratic partisan epithet. (That said, non-anti-Democrats who use it in a neutral manner do so either because they don’t realize it’s incorrect or because shortening party names is historically common: the Federalist Party was occasionally called the Federal Party in colloquial settings, or how the Republican Party is called the G.O.P.)This isn’t new, partisan epithets are as old as the nation itself. Loyalists to the British monarchy in the Thirteen Colonies were called Tories while American revolutionaries, particularly in the northern colonies, were called Yankees.The Democratic Party actually got it’s name from an epithet. Originally, and ironically, called the Republican Party, the Party’s initial opponents, the aforementioned Federalists, called the Republicans “Democrats” to associate them to the left-wing, liberal radicalism of the the French Revolution. The name was quickly adopted by opponents of the liberal, pro-French Republicans, but just as quickly appropriated by those same Republicans endearing them with the masses, namely workers, farmers, immigrants, and other out-groups as champions of the common man. For the next several decades Democrat would continue in use, more and more as a badge of honor and less so as an epithet. By the 1820s and 1830s, those who rallied around the Jacksonian cause added the Democratic descriptor to their Republican name to differentiate themselves from the neo-Federalist faction (since the actual Federalist Party was virtually extinct at the national level) within the Republican Party: the pro-Adams, pro-Clay National Republicans. The Republicans, now clearly embracing the Democratic label and calling themselves Democratic Republicans more openly than ever, would eventually fully embrace simply the name of the Democratic Party in 1844. The neo-Federalist Whig Party would try to add the label democratic to their party name, but with little meaningful success. It’s no surprise that Democrats maintained overall control of government national politics for six decades after Jefferson’s election while their opponents, Federalists, National Republicans, and Whigs have become bywords for failed political institutions, only living on indirectly through the modern Republican Party; don’t mind the irony in that too much.",42,0,10,238,0,0

5,Is Tommy Robinson the British activist a troublemaker who was rightfully arrested?,Drudge Report (website),1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Thanks for the ask.On May 8, 2017 he attended a rape trial in Canterbury Crown Court. He attempted to record video footage inside the courtroom itself (which is expressly forbidden in all court cases in the UK under our Contempt of Court laws, as it is considered prejudicial in active trials). Having been removed from the courtroom and having had the rules explained regarding where someone can and cannot record video footage with respect to courts (as in, not in the courtroom, not in the courthouse, and not on the precincts of the courthouse itself - directly outside), he proceeded to record in the courthouse and on the precincts of the courthouse.He was arrested for this and sentenced to three months imprisonment, suspended for eighteen months. This meant that if he didn’t break the law for the next 18 months, the three month jail sentence would go away, but if he did, that sentence would be added to the subsequent sentence. In sentencing him, the judge said the following:“You should be under no illusions that if you commit any further offence of any kind, and that would include, I would have thought, a further contempt of court by similar actions, then that sentence of three months would be activated, and that would be on top of anything else that you were given by any other court.”In fairness, when Tommy Robinson turned up outside Leeds Crown Court on May 25, 2018, for the first hour of his recording he stayed outside the precincts of the courthouse. He then crossed the road to shake the hand of a prisoner about to go to jail and forgot to switch his cameraphone off. That landed him in contempt once again.Many rookie court reporters fall foul of this part of the Contempt of Court rules, by putting a sneaky toe too far forward and crossing into the precincts of the court in the process. And, like Tommy Robinson was given the first time, they are taken aside and warned where they can and cannot stand. If they do it again, they are arrested and typically given a suspended sentence and when they get back to their office, their editor will either fire them, remove them from court duty, or tear them a new one with such force they never get to the third strike.So, yes, Tommy Robinson was rightfully arrested. You are allowed a rookie error in this, but not three. If he wants to present himself as thrusting media champion in the future, he should read McNae’s Essential Law for Journalists and find out what he can and cannot do.If he waits for the next edition, he’ll probably be in it.On the other hand, if his excitement constantly gets the better of him outside a court (and for some journalists, that happens) he should either pursue another course of journalism, or another source of employment.

5,Is Tommy Robinson the British activist a troublemaker who was rightfully arrested?,Drudge Report (website),1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Yes. The UK has strict laws about reporting during trials (and before trials) to ensure that trials are not influenced by biased reporting - leading to a mistrial. The sort of reporting which happens pre and during a trial in the USA is simply illegal here - factual reporting as to who said what during a trial is fine. The sort of talking-head speculation about witnessess, the life-history of the accused and such which happens in the USA is likely here to influence a jury and is contempt of court.On the plus side, this means that juries don’t have to be sequestered in the same way as juries are sequestered in the USA (look at what amounted to the months in prison which the OJ Simpson jurors had to endure to avoid seeing the media coverage). Sometimes when there’s linked trials, there are restrictions on reporting until the last one is complete, so that juries won’t learn that the Uncle referred to in one trial has aleady been found guilty / pleaded guilty of a similar offence in another trial.Once a trial is over, ther media are all over the details like seagulls on chips - rest assured that the British Public are given every detail revealed in court, full background on the accused, the full works. All reporters should know the rules, they’re clear and generally followed. Robinson was under a suspended sentence for trying to disrupt a trial by self-reporting on social media a highly biased and distorted view of events which could have led to a mistrial.He was given a very clear instruction by the judge that were he in the next 18 months to turn up to another trial and broadcast views about the guilt of those whose cases had not yet been determined by a jury then he would go to prison.

He wanted the cops to arrest him so that he could claim he was oppressed, and use that to embolden his supporters. Inciting a response and then complaining about it is a common tactic of the far-right, such as when racist groups bait anti-fascists into fights, like at Charlottesville.Arresting feeds into the far-right narrative of “Islamic takeover” and “leftist censorship”, and has already resulted in hundreds of far-right protesters gathering in Downing Street.[1]Robinson is, in my opinion, a very dangerous figure. This is, after all, a man who was briefly the vice-chairman of a neo-fascist political party.[2] He’s also given speeches where he claimed that “every single Muslim” bore responsibility for terrorism, and threatened violence against the Islamic community as a response.[3] Please see video in footnotes.But still, arresting him for his actions outside the recent trial was a bad move; it’s only going to embolden his supporters.A better move would be to simply ignore Robinson and his bigoted ramblings.Allah (subhanahu wa ta’ala) knows best.

Americans were highly educated in the 50’s and 60’s. We were fighting the Cold War and had a Space Race, so government invested heavily in public education and pushed math and science; nevertheless, most people still went to church and believed in God.Christianity’s influence on society wouldn’t be a problem if the majority of Christians lived Christ-like lives like they are supposed to. For example, Jesus didn’t tell the leper, “Sorry, that’s a pre-existing condition.” He healed him, free of charge. He frequently fed the hungry and the masses. He sympathized with those stuck in poverty rather than accusing them of making bad choices. He was loving and tolerant of his neighbor. He forgave people of their sins. He looked down on materialism and wealth, and kicked three greedy businessmen out of a church in righteous anger. He certainly did not tell people that owning weapons was a God-given right, as the mass manufacture and distribution of assault weapons flies in the face of his “turn the other cheek” philosophy.If you study the Bible as a work of literature and follow the plot, you find that the character John the Baptist explains the birth of Christ as ushering in the Gospel of Good News, a fresh way of looking at things, as opposed to the Old Testament way of fire, brimstone and public stonings. Unfortunately, too many Christians are stuck on their favorite cherry-picked verses from the Old Testament, and many others have a problem “loving their neighbor” unless that neighbor is as white as they mistakenly believe Jesus was.

For many on the right, the exercise in trying to prove color blindness somehow exposes a lack of empathy, christian values, and bigotry. Instead to thinking something is wrong- headed about blacks not wanting to be conservative, perhaps conservatives/Republicans should ponder what about their own behavior could possibly NOT appeal to more people, specifically black people.Secondly, know your audience. Black people want good and effective law enforcement and better economic opportunities just like all Americans. However, although stop and frisk may work, there could be a consequence.Note: Some black people are never going to get over the waxing that conservatives/Republicans preformed on President Barack Obama.

4,Are the Democrats and the old Republican party people running scared of Trump? Will they ever re-group?,Democratic Party vs. Republican Party,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Democrats, right now, are a seething mass of outrage. When Trump won the election, there were a few weeks of shock and denial. The party fell into chaos after their historic failure in 2016. That was an election they should have won easily. Instead, they lost to Vladimir Putin and the guy from Celebrity Apprentice. It was a moment of shame for the entire country, but especially for the Democratic Party.Then there was the Women’s March.It was possibly the single biggest political march in US history. It was held the day after we swore in Trump, and easily dwarfed his fun-sized inauguration crowds.From that sprung hundreds of local groups. These groups descended on airports when Trump attempted to enact his racist and intolerant immigration policies. They descended on the offices of Congressional leaders to stop him from gutting the Affordable Care Act and stealing health coverage from millions.Democrats have won election after election in the aftermath of Trump. The Blue Wave is real. The party itself is still rudderless, but the voters are ready to grab their pitchforks and torches.As for the old Republican Party… it is shattered and demoralized. They sold their soul to a reality TV star in exchange for some doomed-to-be-short-lived tax breaks. I don’t know what they were thinking.Republicans with any principles are fleeing their own party. It’s going to take a generation for them to recover from what’s happened in the last 18 months alone. White Supremacists marching down American streets. A president that no sane person wants to work for, who lies — provably lies — to the American people more than four times per day. In 18 months we went from world power to international laughing stock. That’s all on Republicans.The Democratic Party is still in a time of transition. Trump exploded the political norms we’re used to and Hillary Clinton proved that the center-right days of the Democratic Party are over. 2018 will probably give Democrats back the house, but not the Senate. That year and 2019 will be the birth of the new left-leaning Democratic party, at least in my opinion.In 2020 there will be a Democratic Party rallied behind a leader that will likely reflect the anger the majority of Americans feel towards their government right now. Maybe it will be Joe Biden thundering away at Trump in debates, or maybe it will be a new, younger leader. Maybe we’ll nominate another woman and try to make history, once again.In 2021 Republicans will likely be out of power, completely. You’ll probably see regulations put in place to curtail the destructive power of another Trump-like leader. Maybe even some rules put in place for special elections if foreign interference can be determined to have corrupted the results of an election.After that you’re probably looking at total Democratic control until 2023. Maybe the GOP takes the house back per tradition that year, maybe not. Not if they’re still the party of Trump, that’s for sure. They’re going to have to go through their own transitional period, and find out what kind of party they want to be.

There are exceptions, especially in Arizona for some reason.I think the Senate and the House are separate issues and the Federal and State divide as well. Trump has few stout defenders in the old guard Republican Party. His booster squad is very much the Post Obama component of the GOP. The people who came in from 2010 onward. This is not true of the Senate where his support is grounded in the extremists but otherwise it is little more than nominal and only then because these guys are very cagey at politics.The challenge so far is that running as a “mini-Trump” keeps backfiring. Even non politicians who make a Trumpian gaffe get ground up while he still seems to have Teflon armor on.So how long can this last? If there is in fact a “blue wave” coming up, the Republicans will turn on him. If there is no Democratic Insurgency, then the GOP that has existed since Goldwater and Reagan reshaped the party will be very much dead. The TeaPublicans will have fully wrested control and excised any vestiges of moderation.The value of that outcome is purely a personal opinion but I will find it unfortunate. This new Republican Party has no ideology beyond, “things were better before”. They are ideologically inconsistent on everything else. They pick and choose when their positions apply (Govt should stay out of people’s healthcare, unless you are a woman, everyone should have a gun except around congress members). The ideal scenario is Debt. The Republicans always complain about debt but they operate the debt causing districts and the debt driving states. They rationalize that if they could just kick all the “takers” off the government teet we would be fine. What they fail to recognize is that they have more “takers” per capita than other places and that poses risk.The Democrats on the other hand were simply bought off. Their ideology is basically, everything should be fair, which is a myth, nothing is really fair. Their policy is no less procorporatist than the Republicans, it’s just devoid of the malevolent racism but keeps most of the institutional racism in place.We let money poison politics and we ended up with a bunch of whores. Trump promised to “drain the swamp” but really, he just imported more brazen whores with lower standards.Neither party will stabilize until we clean up campaign finance. Everyone is now being bought and sold by a monied interest that might not even be American anymore. State House campaigns get campaign contributions from the far side of the country and both Presidential Candidates last go around got money and/or support from outside the county.One day we might wake up and realize we are being ruled, not governed and unless you have a couple of million, disposable and discretionary, dollars you are unlikely to be in the new hereditary nobility of the Neo-American Empire, you will just be a resource to be exploited as needed.",202,5,275,"1,377",0,0

Especially if someone manages to get it released or leaked to the public.I suspect then that a monumental effort will be undertaken to keep it from being release, ever, and to have that established well before Mueller’s team finishes. Of course, that will prove hard to manage, first because no one knows how far away “finished” is, and second because it’s apparently not that easy to establish a legally defensible premise.Nixon tried his devious best. That just didn’t work, and his failure is a matter of official court records: “Precedence”…So, like with Nixon, the GOP congressmen won’t be afraid of what Washington might say, or the DOJ might dispute. They will be very nervous about what their own compatriots and voters might do, more than anything.Just like last time, Congress has been largely waiting for someone else to give them the overriding excuse to rid themselves of what they know is an unproductive, uncooperative and very unpopular obstacle, to the one thing they have come to value most: Their own longevity in office.They must already realize that Trump is a danger to that which keeps them in office, voter decisions. They can see the “blue wave” coming in this year’s elections, and wouldn’t it be ever-so comforting to eliminate the most divisive, chronic and politically dangerous aspect of their environment right now.They’re also smart enough to realize that they could so much more easily pursue their ongoing agenda (not Trump’s agenda), if they didn’t have Trump’s flaming firestorm of controversy to wade through every single day they try to do their jobs.Do you remember who was President after Nixon?“The presidency of Gerald Ford began on August 9, 1974, when Gerald Ford became President of the United States upon the resignation of Richard Nixon from office, and ended on January 20, 1977, a period of 895 days. Ford had served as Vice President of the United States since December 6, 1973, following Spiro Agnew's resignation from that office.”“Mr. Vanilla”…By comparison, to the present GOP congress members, even Pence would be such a great relief from the “Barnum and Trump Circus”, that once credible evidence would be in the public’s hands where they couldn’t deny it, they would consider it a “gift”, not a burden.

Why did the economy improve, then and now? If you can comprehensively and consistently answer that question, you'll be a good candidate to win the Nobel Prize.The fact is, the degree to which any president can impact the economy is a topic of much debate, even among professional economists, but it's pretty clear that there's only so much a president can do to move the needle in either direction, and changes tend to happen slowly. Whoever's president when the economy improves will, to a near certainty, try to take credit for it. Whether they had anything to do with it or not is an open question.In the case of the current economy, I'm 100% certain it isn't entirely Trump's doing. Does he have anything at all to do with it? That's hard to say. If you ask his supporters what he's done to drive it, they'll generally point to the tax bill, but that doesn't really seem to have changed the trajectory of jobs growth or economic performance in any clear way. They'll talk about him being generally business friendly and coal friendly, but the actual, concrete changes that he's made are so small that it's really reaching to claim they had any substantial economic impact. The biggest argument they can make is that his mere presence in office increased business confidence, which then stimulates growth (there was a clear bump up in the stock market right after the election, despite him being months away from even taking office. That may or may not have validity, but the effect is so wildly ambiguous that it's impossible to draw a straight line between that and how the economy is currently doing. It also raises a far more interesting question: if someone's mere presence (irrespective of anything they actually do) has an effect, should they get credit for simply being there? That's a philosophical point, but it's the kind of thing that we end up in when debating the intersection between economics and politics.What is true, and undeniable, is that the economy has continued its upward trajectory under Trump. Whether or not he had any impact on it, he hasn't derailed economic growth, which is a good thing. Whether or not he's driven that, or deserves credit for it, or should be returned to the White House for it are all much more complex questions, for which there is no objective answer.I will say this. If the economy goes sour over the next two years, I absolutely and completely guarantee that neither Trump nor his supporters will claim it's his fault. I mean, Trump is trying to blame Democrats for his policy of taking children of immigrants away from their parents, is he going to say ""my bad"" if the economy crashes? And Trump's opponents will all loudly declare that it's entirely his fault, and of course this was going to happen. Because neither side is looking for an objective determination about economic cause and effect. They're both looking to shore up their own talking points.The real question is whether you think the policies that Trump is pursuing are sound, appropriate and sustainable. And that goes for all his policies, not just economic. Saying that he's a good or bad president based on what the economy is doing today is almost as dumb as saying global warming isn't real because it's cold outside.",482,13,14k,"6,948",0,0

2,Did Trump’s administration do anything directly to help lower the black unemployment rate or are the numbers just a lucky side effect of the bull economy?,CNBC,Unemployment Rate,Fox News (cable news network),1!,1!,1!,"Yes, in fact he did.What Trump did was hold out hope to the economy.This is the thing all the various Democratic commentators, professional and otherwise, seem to fail to understand. The economy is less about monetary policy and taxes than it is about trust.Just to take out the passion out of this discussion, let’s deal in historical examples, namely France, England and the United States.France was always a much naturally wealthier country than England, with a larger land mass, greater population and a fair climate. It had a well-organized state, better organized in fact than their English cousins, yet England rivaled and surpassed France militarily for most of their common history for an interesting reason.England routinely collected a far greater proportion of its national output in the form of taxes, which allowed its state to out-spend France. Various political scientists, including the estimable Francis Fukuyama, attribute this to the trust average Britons had for their government, which had, for the time, a remarkable degree of political representation across all of its classes. State projects had a high degree of support from the population, whereas the French were (and still are) hiding their income from the tax man. The French institutionalization of corruption through the sale of venal offices (government functions sold as heritable property), changed the relationship between the governors and the governed, creating a mirror image of the high-trust relationship in Britain.To make this even clearer, consider that the American revolution, sparked by issues of taxation, occurred in a circumstance where Britons paid FIVE TIMES the taxes than did Americans.Tax revenues, as expressed as a percentage of GDP, are a pretty good indicator of how much trust citizens have for their governments. Weak governments in developing countries collect much less that strong governments (i.e. the Scandinavian countries, Germany). Germany in particular has a high tax rate, but delivers public goods with an efficiency and effectiveness comparable to the private sector. In other words, they provide clear value for a given tax Euro even as they respect the legal rights of their citizens.Americans have enormous respect for their democratic institutions, but little confidence in their government(s), which are seen as corrupt, incompetent, and manipulative. Democrats believed Obamacare would guarantee political dominance for several generations, but stubbornly ignored the fact that the only people who liked it where their political clients—supporters who are NOT presented with a bill. Judging from the 4 losing election cycles (soon to be five?), Obamacare was an albatross rather than a Pegasus.Second only to the “basket of deplorables” comment, perhaps nothing hurt Hillary Clinton, and the image of the Democratic Party more than her “unfortunate” response to West Virginia coal miners. She promised an ambiguous “green energy” future (the same future Obama had promised eight years prior…) even as she declared they would be losing their mining jobs in the present.For an allegedly smart lady, she sure said a lot of incredibly stupid things. This kind of comment, and similar ones by President Obama and other elite Democrats, did nothing to improve moral, and in fact the Democratic Party message seems to be that White People need to take their medicine and quit their whining.Maybe they do, but seriously, do you think elections can be won with this type of rhetoric? Do you think people can be convinced to invest time, energy and resources when this is the attitude of the governing elites?Economies do well when people feel their investments are secure. When they don’t feel secure, for whatever reason, they hold back. President Trump may say things people don’t like to hear, but he is doing the things they like to see, which is why consumer confidence is at an historical high and why black unemployment is at a low ebb.",234,10,514,"3,198",0,2

Instead of improving opportunity, these policies are removing it.The greatest economic growth and development the US ever enjoyed was after WW II when the GI bill allowed 500,000 returning service people to attend school.

The first is Thomas Sowell’s Conflict of Visions, where he says that the primary difference is built around the idea of the perfectibility of the individual human. Not perfectibility in the sense of being ultimately perfect: not only no, but hell no. But perfectible in the sense of being improvable, to be able to learn and grow, to be and become. And to learn to see things from a higher vantage point.Liberals say that people can continue to be coached up, and should be governed in such a way as to encourage the development of higher-quality humans. Conservatives—Sowell is one—tend to view human nature as immutable. What you see is what you get, and any “improvements” are illusory, or bear the high cost of unintended consequences.For a contrary point of view, check out Moral Politics, by George Lakoff, a liberal thinker. For Lakoff, the difference is one of Nurturing Parent vs. Strict Parent. Going way over the top here, and in pursuit of grins, Lakoff sees Nurturing Parents as those who nourish and shape and form, and who have a great deal of patience for miscreants who haven’t gotten the message yet. Strict Parents, on the other hand, are more likely to yell, “Of course you can’t have the damn car Saturday night. You missed taking the trash out last week and—dammit!— you just can’t be irresponsible like that and expect to skate by. Actions have consequences!”I’m a political moderate, by the way. A Democrat, but not as far left as you might think.And as you look at what I’ve written, hopefully you can see that my politically-moderate stance is at least partly informed by believing that both sides have valid points.

We believe the United States of America is unlike any other nation on earth. We believe America is exceptional because of our historic role — first as refuge, then as defender, and now as exemplar of liberty for the world to see.”The 2016 Democratic Platform begins with more specifics about what the government should do for its citizens but eventually gets to who we are or should be on a world scale and I quote:“Democrats believe we are stronger and safer when America brings the world together and leads with principle and purpose. We believe we should strengthen our alliances, not weaken them. We believe in the power of development and diplomacy. We believe our military should be the best-trained, best-equipped fighting force in the world, and that we must do everything we can to honor and support our veterans. And we know that only the United States can mobilize common action on a truly global scale, to take on the challenges that transcend borders, from international terrorism to climate change to health pandemics.”As an American whose main objective for our country is to stop war and start peace, I find both platforms objectionable.It’s hard to think of a more isolating, insulting, false, and dangerous attitude than the Republicans express, and the Democratic position puts war as a central theme and obligation in the false guise of supporting peace.It is our government that supports and wages our wars. The people of both parties are propagandized into believing it is our duty and our right to dictate to the world but many are tired of our endless wars.

We elect politicians, again, in theory, to represent our interests in whatever position they occupy.So, it would be logical and reasonable for us to expect that the principles of the politicians we elect to represent us, would require them to act in our best interests. But with a very few notable exceptions, this is rarely what actually happens. Since US politicians have become so reliant on the financial support of the corporate/wealthy class it is their interests and agenda that is actually being promoted by the politician, not the interests of the voters who elected them.So, when a US politician extols his “resume” of “beliefs”, religion, conservatism, or liberalism, he is just pandering for the votes of the public that he needs to get elected. Those “values” or principles are most usually nothing more than an attempt to convince a voter that the politician will represent his interests, but since the interests and agenda of a small percentage of the corporate/wealthy class are really foremost in importance to the politician, the pandering to the voter is a lie.Bottom line answer therefore, is “no”. None of the politicians from either establishment party have coherent principles underlying their political positions. Their commitments and actions are entirely the result of bribery by the corporations and the wealthy who funded their campaigns.

It was a rational argument he was having in his conversation.Now this would be fine and well but carry this over to my time in Scotland when I got to listen into and even participate in discussions about Brexit.These debates shared much in common with American debates, battlelines were drawn.What was different though was the battlelines were only against the position and not the individual.Likewise, people seemed more willing to listen to the other side far more and even conclude they wanted what was best for Scotland.The other side was not the enemy and there was a rationalization that played out in arguments, some issues with argumentative fallacies but those weren’t purposefully inserted to derail the conversation.Now this isn’t politicians debating, just average people.But in the UK and Ireland in my experience the debates tend to be far less toxic between people.There is a recognition of opposing views as opposed to opposing people.A better dialogue emerges from this form of debate, there is less fear of being wrong.To me, the debates felt more like working to a goal to achieve a better nation, not to subvert the other side.",224,2,140,"2,329",0,0

Which is a really odd fact about the new Right: they talk of freedom, but would gladly give up every Right we have (except the 2nd Amendment) for illusions of safety that the Republican Party says they can provide.Why? Social and economic inequality! Because when 2% of the people in a country can get 49% to fight against the other 49%, the 2% can then get away with just about anything they want. Right now, the wealthiest Americans are having a field day. While they get the rest of us to fight over things like abortion, gay marriage, religion in schools and public buildings, illegal immigrants, etc., etc., etc.; they are literally robbing the U.S. treasury. They dupe us all into arguing over the least impactful issues while they proceed to legalize political corruption and transfer more and more government money, your and my tax money, into their own corporate accounts. Why is there growing intolerance? Because there is a growing propaganda machine that fosters intolerance in order to enrich its corporate benefactors.I was wrongly convinced, after the bombastic 2016 presidential election that had huge racist and xenophobic over tones that the majority of Americans couldn’t really be profoundly racist and sexist and intolerant, and that we needed to talk and air out our differences in a respectful fashion… And every time I tried to do so, the hatred and anger and nastiness and disdain for people going through hardships set me back on my heels. A whole lot of people have taken a cue from the current administration to let their bigot flag fly - and it seems a lot more racism and sexism and intolerance exists in America than I had ever dreamed of. I gradually came to the conclusion that it wasn’t worth trying to have a nice conversation about our differences, when that difference could be so hurtful to so many people, and no one’s mind was getting changed anyway.Meanwhile, as our society has become more “connected” and diverse, the appeal of issues close to the racist and evangelical base that makes up the current Republican Party, have become less popular with the general population. Republicans have remained in power regionally in the mid-West and South, through weakening of voting rights laws and appeals to bigots and racists - the very people who steadfastly show up at the polls to vote for Republican candidates, particularly in primaries.Now, the Republican Party has reached a point where racist and social conservative issues are the main drivers in state and Federal level races. Many socially liberal conservatives have abandoned the Republican Party and are voting independent. So, at present, we have a Republican party that is mostly driven by a desire to undo most of the Civil Rights laws, progress for women, and gay rights laws and legislation in place since the 19th century.So, over the past twenty years, successful candidates in conservative districts are leaning more to the right, voted into office by the far-right flank of the southern “big tent”. They’re so extreme, that they would have been considered the radical “fringe” of the party during the Eisenhower years. Now, they’re the Republican Party “mainstream.” It’s why the Trump/Pence appeals to white supremacists and hard-core evangelicals have been successful - it’s motivated Republican voters to the polls who felt that previous Republican candidates were simply paying them “lip service”. This trend is reflected in Congress and Republican-controlled state houses.The other trend that has deepened the divide between the right and left is a breakdown in trusted news sources. Before the Internet, most people got their news from TV networks, local radio, and newspapers that developed practices based on facts and fairness between conservative and liberal views.The hard-right views expressed today by white nationalist or ultra-conservative evangelicals were seen in mainstream media, but have representing a small minority of the larger picture of political thought. During the Kennedy administration, for example, John Birchers or white supremacists would be challenged about their hard-right positions by both left and right-leaning media outlets.Now, with the Internet and cable TV, Republicans have increasingly turned to news sources based on political spin designed to reinforce their views. Fox News, Brie Bart, Info Wars, and other outlets base news on “hype” and conspiracy theories, rather than facts.In opposition, we have a Democratic party that sees these discriminatory issues as anathema to the basic ideals of modern society. But they are supporting liberal causes I don’t agree with. Democrats need to be focused on economic issues and not on Black Lives Matter and those kneeling NFL players who disrespect our flag and National anthem. Democrats, on the other hand, still look to a range of media news coverage that ranges from the hard-left to more “middle of the road”, based on facts and interpretation of those facts.Finally, Republicans have rejected all of the basic tenants of responsible government. Republicans, in pursuit of hard-right issues, have allowed these abuses of power at the local, state, and Federal level to go unpunished in the interest of ideological “purity.”In short, the current Republican Party represents the polar-opposite of anything that Democrats can support - there is no “middle ground” here, no area for negotiation.Republican voters are distilled to a hard-right cohort that wants to see a vision of the country taken back to the early 20th century or earlier, undoing voting rights, desegregation, civil rights protections, and accountability for corruption. In addition, Republicans are wiling to base their views on rumors, conspiracy theories, or outright lies that Democrats cannot accept.

The result — both Obama and his successor have had problems making their respective policies into laws as their congresses haven’t been especially cooperative. So both have resorted to executive orders, that can be easily overturned by their successors. The camaraderie and respect that each division of government should have for one another was lacking for Obama and now for Trump, thus forcing the respective presidents to rule by fiat. Obama used the executive order for the Iran agreement, trade agreements, climate change, EPA, housing rules, etc. And whether or not one agrees with these executive orders, they are being overturned by President Trump’s executive orders. A major policy that became law was President Obama’s health program — and that, for the most part, remains intact.

He came in 3rd in pledged delegates and 4th in vote totals. Thanks to procedural maneuvers, a lot of his supporters got positions as delegates to the National Convention, but they were formally pledged to other candidates on the first ballot. I wouldn’t call that a “popular” campaign. Not a flop, but not a great success either.Secondly, Republican voters mostly aren’t libertarians. Some are, but the majority of Republicans are conservatives. There are also a fair number of moderate Republicans, and even a few liberals.It's not even clear how many of Ron Paul's voters genuinely cared about his platform, rather than his personality and style and his outsider status. Here's a wonderful bit of insight from Tom Massie, a libertarian-leaning Republican who was first elected to Congress in 2012. He explains why so many voters who had previously supported libertarians were voting for Donald Trump (who isn't remotely libertarian) in 2016:All this time, I thought they were voting for libertarian Republicans. But after some soul searching I realized when they voted for Rand and Ron and me in these primaries, they weren't voting for libertarian ideas — they were voting for the craziest son of a bitch in the race.

There is nothing stopping other parties from building such coalitions. Few people understand what is meant by coalition building before an election, or why it is inevitable, or why it is necessary for victory or how it is done… so to those people, it looks like some “system” because they are unable to fathom the actual nature of the cause and effect.

The second component is that a single issue usually doesn’t determine an election.On the other hand with a parliamentary system the more single issue parties and you usually don’t get a majority from one party so a coalition forms. Sometimes the coalitions struggle to form a government and you get gridlock.On the other hand if a coalition gets a majority they can rule without having to worry about the party in the minority blocking agendas.For example in 1980, when president Reagan won, he carried the Senate, but had a House that obstructed as much of his agenda as possible. Obama after 2010 chose not to work with the House and instead issued a lot of executive orders, which have now been mostly over turned.In summation, overall the two party system works for us, if there was a change I would make, it would be to have the Congressional seats be tied in with the presidential vote, which would give a Congressional majority to the president.",35,0,10,199,0,0

His mantra seems to be, “Down with Democrats.”He admits his wrongdoing. He agrees that he did in fact give people money to make contributions to a political candidate and pretend it was really from them. And he further agrees that he knew it was against the law when he did it.It wasn’t really that much money, and only two other people were involved. He argues that it is commonly done, and literally never prosecuted, so the only sensible reason why he was prosecuted was because of a vendetta by the Obama White House.If indeed D’Souza’s right, that it happens all the time on a far greater scale than his felony, and when these crimes come to the attention of authorities, they uniformly fail to prosecute, then I see his point. The judge sentencing him was given that argument and rejected it, though.So what was the immoral justification for the pardon? Or at least the unethical reason for it.This is just another example of Trump signaling that he will take care of his own. That he’s not afraid to pardon, and that he won’t necessarily wait until the end of his presidency to do it.D’Souza has made movies and written books. He’s a Christian apologist.

He did it for two reasons. The first reason is that Trump wished to demonstrate that in this country, he will decide who is guilty or innocent, and that he and his supporters are above the law. It’s a slap at law enforcement and the independent judiciary. The second reason is to send a message to Michael Cohen, who faces similar charges as D’Souza and who knows where all of Trumps skeletons are buried. He wants Cohen to know that he, Trump, is capable and quite willing to obstruct justice and abuse his power to assure his criminal cohort that if he, Cohen, will take the fall and cover for Trump, Trump will void rule of law in America and get him off the hook if he’s convicted. Spoiler alert: Cohen is guilty as sin based solely on what is already publicly known about the case.Here’s why Trump’s ploy won’t work: Special Prosecutor Mueller is following a strategy whereby he refers state crimes discovered in prosecution of federal crimes to the State of New York, in whose business Trump may not interfere. If Trump succeeds in getting his henchman off the federal hook, there will be a whole raft of state charges awaiting Cohen. Cohen is aware of this, and he may cooperate in the case against Trump.

This is like calling Trump a “dumb prick” except that referring to female bits by a vulgar name seems worse to us than referring to male bits that way. Oh, except that it’s okay for our President to have referred to women’s pussies, in the context of saying that he feels entitled to grab them even when they belong to women he doesn’t know who haven’t given him permission to do so. Funny how the easily-offended just look right over that one, and all the other egregiously ugly things he has said, but never apologized for.Some people, particularly Americans, see the word cunt as demeaning to women, reducing them to their sexual parts. Other people in other countries use the word cunt as a general insult and fling it about at anyone and everyone.Given Bee’s gender and her obvious position on women’s equality and rights, I think she used it in a more general sense, as just a really low insult, though no one knows except Bee and I am not sure she’ll be discussing it in detail.Barr compared Valerie Jarrett to an ape. For those of you who wonder what the big deal is, it is a classic racist trope that black people are a lower species than white people, basically just apes who learned to talk.

There’s a history here, of Ivanka publishing a book about strong women, many of whom made public statements distancing themselves from her. The policies of Ivanka’s businesses also belie her so-called family values. She is so out of touch with reality that she went off to talk to Planned Parenthood on a ‘compromise,’ got schooled, and came home with egg on her face.There’s also the creepy history, which wouldn’t exist except for Donald starting and continuing it, of his personally-confessed attraction to Ivanka. It’s one of the reasons she — with zero qualifications — ended up in his administration. She is apparently able to get his attention for up to 15 minutes. Bee wasn’t suggesting that Ivanka have sex with Donald. She was suggesting that Ivanka use his self-confessed attraction to her to get his attention long enough to influence him to stop having babies and children torn out of their mothers’ arms.I might not have used the same word, but I agree with Bee: Ivanka, STFU about caring about women and children until you get a clue.Police called as Sen.

When I evaluate someone’s behavior, I evaluate it independently of the other side. I don’t care how many sexist things that a republican might say when I’m evaluating the sexism of a democrat. Two wrongs do not make a right and I have remarkably little patience for ‘whataboutism’. Liberals consistently claim they have an issue with it as well but only seem to take issue when it’s the republicans who are engaging in it.Quite recently I got into a discussion with a man who claimed to be a liberal. He was making excuses for various examples of liberals being sexist, mainly by finger-pointing to the republicans, complaining about Donald Trump and going on about how he can’t see why republicans would think they have any room to discuss the issue.As a centrist who did not vote for Donald Trump (and also a woman if that makes any difference) I pointed out to him that sexism is unacceptable no matter what side it is coming from and he doesn’t get to be the sole decision maker on whether or not a sexist comment is harmful to women.His response? He made a ‘joke’ in which he responded “Sssssh, the men are talking”He then asked if that is how a conservative would normally respond and added that he is generally used to being respectful of other people during discussions so “this whole being a sexist thing” was new to him.I had already made it clear to him that I am not a republican so I don’t know what value he thought it added to ‘pretend’ to talk to me like a conservative but needless to say this “respectful” liberal who is used to treating women with respect had quite the odd sense of humor.I wrote about it here: It’s Not Sexist if the Democrats Do It by Lauren Campbell on The Synergism School of EqualityHere is an excerpt from my post:I have seen democrats get on republicans about this type of finger-pointing numerous times. They claim that whenever republicans are shown things that their party has done wrong, they immediately start going “well what about Hillary!” when it’s irrelevant to the discussion at hand.Now if you will please peruse the answers on this page you will notice a plethora of democrats doing exactly this, finger-pointing to republicans to deflect attention from Samantha Bee.Hypocrites.There may be a cultural difference as well. In many other countries the “c word” is used casually, to refer to friends and make jokes and is rather inoffensive. It’s kind of the the same way the word ‘bitch’ is oftentimes used here in the US. It’s far removed from its original meaning, it is used to refer to both men and women and it isn’t much of an insult anymore.In the US on the other hand, people can live their entire lives without having the amount of hatred necessary for someone to hurl the “c word” at them. It is pretty much the last slur outside of the “n word” that still contains enough venom that many people can go their whole lives without wielding it against someone else.Unlike other slang terms such as ‘bitch’ it also hasn’t lost much of its gendered meaning. It’s not used for men and women fairly interchangeably, it is still used to specifically degrade women.Using the word has less to do with its meaning and more of the expression of intent behind it. It is an intention to hurt, an intention to degrade. Using it says “this is the worst thing I can say to hurt you” and that is why it is particularly shocking to Americans when it is used as a genuine insult.Because it is so rarely used, invoking it demonstrates the full amount of contempt behind it.That however was not the most offensive part of what Samantha Bee said in my opinion. What we have repeatedly observed is that Donald Trump has behaved in strange ways towards his daughter Ivanka. While no reasonable person could use it to claim that he has surely sexually abused her there is an uncomfortable dynamic in the way he treats her. To make a joke about the situation, to act like sexual abuse is funny, or something that can be trivialized, is in my opinion, terrible.Sexually abusing one’s daughter is not funny, it’s not a laughing matter and Samantha Bee goes the extra mile of making it out like Ivanka is a willing participant in this, that she is to be held responsible for her father’s feelings, that she’s a tease who uses her sexuality to manipulate him.It is disgusting in my opinion.Here is the full quote:""You know, Ivanka, that's a beautiful photo of you and your child, but let me just say, one mother to another, do something about your dad's immigration practices, you feckless c***!""""He listens to you,"" she added. ""Put on something tight and low-cut and tell your father to f***ing stop it. Tell him it was an Obama thing and see how it goes, OK?""Imagine if a conservative had said something like that about a liberal woman. There would have been outrage all around. But because it was directed at Ivanka Trump it was fine.I grow tired of the expectations liberals have that Ivanka should simply denounce or disown her own father, or somehow force him to agree with her own politics or convince him to go back on promises he made to his own constituents. I wrote about the subject here: Lauren Campbell's answer to How can Ivanka Trump call her dad a ‘feminist’?What did Ivanka do that inspired so much venom?Ivanka Trump’s 'Tone Deaf’ Photo With Son Sparks Backlash Over Border SeparationsShe posted a picture on social media of her and her child. That’s it. People started claiming that this was ‘tone deaf’ because of recent discussions of immigrant families being separated at the border. To me, it looks like she had some professional photography done and shared it. I don’t know anyone who would consider posting a family photo ‘tone deaf’ but boy apparently she deserves to be called derogatory names now and be instructed to go and commit incest with her father.It’s just despicable, it’s grasping at straws to express hate and rage towards anyone close to Donald Trump. Ivanka has done nothing wrong, she does not agree with his politics, she has used her business to do good, she joined his campaign and speaks of being very honest with her father about her views. People are simply blaming her for not being able to change her father’s mind on everything they don’t agree with him on and it has inspired vicious attacks towards her. I’m sick of it.Does Samantha deserve to be fired? I wouldn’t weep if she was. Some of her sponsors have pulled support from her show and I think that should be message enough.What I am more sick of is the constant hypocrisy and sexism from the left, which they refuse to acknowledge and constantly make up excuses for.",20.1k,846,4.9k,"4,715",1,1
9,Should Samantha Bee be fired for her inappropriate and derogatory comments?,Samantha Bee (comedian),1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"As an outsider, I am not a big fan of the first daughter Ivanka, and only till this incident made public did I know the host Samantha Bee, as I seldom watch TV, anyway, as blasted by many Western medias, most TV channels are blocked here in China, so even if I want to watch, there is no chance for me to do so.So, here I am not going to be for or against neither of the two ladies.First, as a TV host, a public figure, someone who can lead or destroy, minding his/her words and behaviors should be the basic professional requirements. From this perspective, Bee indeed shouldn’t have said that disgraceful word. But as we can see, she has apologized for it publicly.But if Bee was not cursing the first daughter, instead a “nobody,” will this incident turn into an “international hot topic?” Possibly not. Not many people would notice it, and it would never be an issue of the White House, and Bee has her “freedom of speech” in her future shows.So, from this angel, can we say, even in the States, where some people claim “freedom is above all the other rights,” there are still boundaries for “freedom of speech,” and “freedom of speech” itself can be double-standard?And as to whether Bee should be fired, I don’t think so. No one can guarantee that he/she would never make any mistakes in his/her whole life. Mistakes or errors should not be obstacles of growing, instead, they are lessons for self-improving.A hypothesis: If a Bee like Chinese TV host got fired because she cursed Chinese President Xi Jinping’s daughter Xi Mingze in her TV show, how would the Western medias report this? “Famous TV host persecuted for cursing Chinese first daughter” “Xi punished famous TV host severely to protect his daughter” “Xi tightens control on media after daughter cursed” “Human rights again violated in China by banning TV host” ......That’s for sure something we can expect.So, next time, when all those Western fighters and those Western medias slam over China’s lack of “freedom”, China’s censorship......blabla.....Keep this Ivanka-Bee case in your mind.There is no absolute “freedom” in the world.

Non-political studies of kindergarteners’ personalities match surprisingly well with political studies of the same people once they’ve reached voting age. We tend to say that “liberals are like this…” and “conservatives are like that …” but what we really see are missing words: there are personality types that tend to become liberal or conservative: how humans relate to authority, risk and change seems to come in a big pattern that overlays our politics.There are also things we think of as conservative values, appreciating past traditions, attempting to hold the nation together against pressures that would splinter it, being willing to serve (especially in the armed forces) if called on, integrity, working hard and taking responsibility for your failures … until recently, being rooted in family, church or community instead of materialism.I would split my answer:Today’s Republican Party is still composed predominately of people with the psychological characteristics we label conservative. A bit more stoic (to use a positive term) or rigid (to use a negative); a bit more fearful, or cautious, or aware of and prepared to deal with threats (to choose inherently-biased terms to label more objective research); more concerned about in-groups and purity and traditional taboos (eg immigration, same sex marriage, etc.)I do, strongly, believe that there is such a thing as useful conservative values even if I’m more the liberal psychological type — and America desperately needs those values. When people imagine a small town where people look out for their neighbors, work hard to build businesses that can hire others and would never cheat, serve in the military, on juries and wherever they are needed, balance their budgets. But today’s Republican Party, on the national stage, has very few of “conservative values” in the positive sense. Anyone who didn’t stand up against, for just one example, Birtherism, and draw a very public line in the sand there, is not a conservative with integrity. The same with veterans being thrown out of the US over immigrant status, or the pattern since Reagan of Republicans accelerating the deficit.America probably will have a cognitively-conservative party, because homo sapiens do seem to split this way, so those votes are out there.

2,Why don't Republicans believe in universal healthcare?,Universal Healthcare,Health Insurance,1!,1!,1!,1!,"From the way the question is worded it appears to be little more than a plant to have a forum to rant but, on the off chance that it is genuine, I will attempt a response.First of all, it is not a question of belief or non-belief. It is simply a reality that universal healthcare is not economically viable and places enormous strains on national budgets and actually creates inefficiencies in delivery of services and tends to reduce the quality of care.There is not one example of an economically viable universal healthcare model or national healthcare system that demonstrates viability.Every major nation with a national healthcare or universal healthcare system has incredible deficits in their programs and is the single highest budget expenditure of government after defense spending and government itself. Virtually every one runs tremendous budget deficits and very substantial percentages of GDP that has to be expended to cover the costs of the systems in order to maintain them.And, every nation with those national health and universal healthcare programs have very long wait times for needed diagnostic and surgical procedures, some that run into years of wait time for patients to be seen.There are other factors that impact the viability of any healthcare plan and the primary one is the ability of government to control the cost factors of healthcare, something that does not exist within a capitalistic society/economy.Most of the existing universal healthcare systems are in socialistic nations and there is not one that does not have serious issues in sustaining their programs.And, if that is not sufficient evidence, just look at the disaster Obamacare has been and you will have more than enough explanations as to the reality of what I have provided in this response.And, one last point, can you name one program that the government has installed and administers that has not expanded in costs and inefficiencies and produced the need to increase taxes?",114,5,19,281,0,0
2,Why don't Republicans believe in universal healthcare?,Universal Healthcare,Health Insurance,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Universal healthcare would require the government to provide health services to every person in the country, exactly as is already done in every other established democracy in the world.

Thus, the group of wealthy Republican supporters who own and/or make money from these companies would find themselves out of business and unable to reap the huge profits they are used to making. For Republicans, that would result in less money coming into their party in the form of political contributions, and no good Republican would let providing much-needed help to average Americans stand in the way of allowing their party to make a few extra bucks.The same would be true of drug manufacturers, who would no longer be free to raise the prices of drugs at will and without regard for what that would mean for the average person whose life might depend on whether or not they could afford to pay for those drugs.

You can review what Insurers actually do, by loking at SEC filings, P&L or by going onto the insurer home page and seeing what businesses they operate.

2,Why don't Republicans believe in universal healthcare?,Universal Healthcare,Health Insurance,1!,1!,1!,1!,"I think it would be presumptuous to assume that Republicans as a whole do not “believe in universal healthcare.” Having talked with many Republicans, the issues with the Affordable Care Act are driven by the belief that it is unsustainable and overly expensive and regulated way to broaden health insurance access, and that it does not achieve “universal health care.”As I have said many times in responses to questions like this, having a health insurance policy, even one that costs nothing, like Medicaid, is meaningless unless doctors participate in the system, and patients have access to doctors. If doctors withdraw from a single-payer system because it does not pay them enough, we can have the perverse and counterintuitive result that more insurance coverage yields less healthcare availability. That happened for many Medicaid patients in Massachusetts after RomneyCare, a model for ObamaCare, was enacted.Moreover, if we increase the number of people with free access to healthcare by 20 million people (the increase in Medicaid patients), but do not increase the number of doctors, the quality of care deteriorates for everyone, because of strained demand on an already inefficient healthcare delivery system.Think of the analogy of airline miles rewards systems that increase the number of weeks of “blackouts.” We get more miles and more rewards potential, but fewer flights on which to use them, which means that we are worse off.",134,3,152,673,0,0

Furthermore, we understand that everyone in the United States has access to some form of healthcare if he chooses to avail himself to it. It's illegal for an emergency department or hospital to turn away someone in need of care.Something else we (at least us Libertarians) understand is that there's no such thing as a free lunch and someone will pay for that care. We also realize that the care can be best tailored if the consumer is financing the care. More government intervention actually makes the care more expensive, less efficient, and scarcer.People talk about how expensive healthcare is in the United States, but what they fail to realize is that many medical procedures have dropped in price. About fifteen years ago I had LASIK surgery in both eyes and I still believe it was the best surgery I've ever had. It also wasn't covered by my insurance. Or in other words, the consumer of the service was also financing it. LASIK surgery is a booming business and every ophthalmologist seems to be doing it now. I just googled the price and since I have it, it's dropped by 90%. That's a massive reduction in price that can be attributed to the law of supply and demand.Republicans and Libertarians aren't opposed to everyone being able to receive care when they need it, but we are rightfully concerned about any heavy-handed, top-down, one-size-fits-none model the is all the other side of the aisle Haas proposed.",61,0,323,"1,422",0,0

Since it has proven more useful in lowering teen pregnancies than the alternatives.Non-profit available birth control and prenatal services and maternal facilities in areas of poverty, since it has proven more useful in lowering/managing women’s health issues, including when they are pregnant and poorer women have less options of travelling far for healthcare.Child poverty rate ~ lower the income disparity. Poverty stricken children is not living a good or even decent life.Adoption process reform. If you want more to give birth and give away their child, please do something about the adoption process, so the kids childhoods are not put on systemic institutionalized hold.Universal healthcare. Because no matter who in the family get chronic sick, the child suffers too.Add to these pointers that legal abortions means safer abortions, illegal abortions means not safe abortions.

2,What are the ideals of Republicans and Democrats nowadays?,Democratic Party vs. Republican Party,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Republicans trend Authoritarian and Comservative, while Democrats trend less Authoritarian and moderately Conservative. On the political scale, there are two factors: Social issues, and Economics. Authoritarian extremes include Stalin, Mussolini, Hitler or the “Iron Curtain”—with Libertarianism being the polar opposite, or “absolute freedom without authority”. On the economic scale, Socialism is on the true-left and Conservatism is at the true-right. American and western politics operate almost exclusively in the Authoritarian Right.RepublicansThe GOP is on the Authoritarian Right. Trump, for example, believes strongly that the public should obey his government and his decisions. His views on his government’s authority are outside of the norm of American politics, and is at the extreme on social issues—but fiscally, his views aren’t unusual.Social issues trend very Authoritarian, where the government can or should intervene to enforce a level of morality to be obeyed.Whereas fiscally conservative ideology favors independence, the Republican Party prefers the government being an authority on behavior and community, or issues effecting only some of our population. There are policies strongly supported that are religious or ethnic in origin, that favor their party’s demographic over others.Republicans are typically against federal laws that require safety, environmental or health regulations that could cost businesses or individuals money or hassle.The current GOP has become more Nationalist, favoring isolation over alliance with other nations globally. There is a defensive, self-centric ideology on foreign policy and immigration.Drugs are seen as an epidemic that should be stopped by enforcing harsher punishments and stronger laws that put drug addicts in prison and deter drug use by fear of consequence. Punishment typically takes priority over rehabilitation, and mandatory minimum sentences are favored as deterants. For-profit private prisons are supported as our public prisons are overpopulated.Republicans are top-down on economics. Conservative economics revolve around the belief that greed is good; that greed can be made useful. Top-down economics, or “trickle down”, subscribed to the belief that if big businesses and the wealthy are thriving, there will be plenty of jobs for everyone else.This economic ideology prefers an individual approach, where there are few government services and less collective contribution (like taxes). Tax cuts and benefits are slanted toward the super-rich and the wealthy, with the average American asked to contribute more.Public services like schools, national parks and environmental protection, NASA, and civil services like work programs or crisis safety nets like welfare or food stamps are generally seen as burdens that weigh down successful Americans.This is a “sink or swim” ideology, where the weak (or lazy) have the fear of failure or devastation to drive productivity, often accompanying the belief that the poor are so of their own making and must try harder—else they weigh down everyone else.Republicans typically are against regulation of big business and for-profit industry. Where for-profit industries are always seeking to make bigger margins, regulations that would attempt to help disadvantaged Americans are typically discouraged as dragging down business and profit.DemocratsDemocrats are toward the true meridian, moderately fiscally conservative and less Authoritarian on social issues. Occasionally, although rare, an American politician will land outside of Western norms. Bernie Sanders, for instance, trends toward fiscal socialism. He is near the true equator between Authoritarian and Libertarian, but it’s on the “far-left” of American norms on economics.Democrats strongly support equality in the eyes of the law, and staunchly support the separation of church and state.The Democrats social ideologies focus on liberty and freedom as one people—working toward equality between women and men, all races and religions, and against having a government that dictates morality.Democrats typically do support federal laws enforcing quality of life for the people, ranging from public safety to environmental protection.This ideology tends to rely on alliances and diplomacy on foreign policy. Sanctions and economics are used to apply pressure, with joint military actions preferred with allied nations (like NATO) and close cooperation with the UN.Democrats trend to favor rehabilitation over punishment for non-violent crime, and lighter sentencing. With a large percentage of our population in prisons for non-violent crime, Democrats are typically against for-profit prisons and excessive punishment for trivial infractions.Drugs are seen as an epidemic that requires a collective effort toward more education, more drug programs and better resources for rehabilitation and resolution.Democrats are bottom-up on economics, or middle-out, depending on the economic plan. Most Democrats are at least partially influenced by Keynesian economics. This approach focuses on the common American, generally most of us. The people’s party, that gave us unions and historically fights for wages and rallies for workers. Democrats subscribe to the idea that when American workers are doing well, bills are paid, credit is good, and the economy is fueled as common Americans are able to thrive, pay and spend.This economic ideology focuses on the middle class and working class, applying tax cuts and economic policies that help the average American. Taxes are slanted toward the super-rich and the wealthy, with most benefits going to common Americans.Democrats typically favor more public services, like National Parks, NASA, our public schools, environmental services, healthcare, and civil services like job training, welfare and food stamps.This ideology favors working together as a collective group. Taxes from the most wealthy are used to pull the least successful up and provide services like job training and education.Most recently, Democrats have made efforts toward public healthcare. The concept being that a cheap public healthcare plan can eliminate the billions of dollars of unpaid emergency room and medical costs the poor are unable to pay, thus lowering the cost of healthcare for everyone.Democrats typically favor oversight and regulation of big business. Where it affects people and our citizens, Democrats tend to want at least some regulation that prevents our for-profit system from exploiting the disadvantaged to a point where it’s impossible for the working class or poor to get ahead.In summary, Republicans are seen as the party of business and de-regulation. Democrats are the people’s party, for public services and wages. On social issues, Republicans trend more Authoritarian, with laws and policies the public should obey. Democrats trend toward a government that works for the people. In a healthy democracy, we would alternate between these approaches regularly—sometimes focusing on industry and business, and then subsequently focusing on workers and people. Democracy suffers when we follow one of these approaches for too long, neglecting the other.",759,4,42,225,1,0

Further, Republicans believe they are the only people who should be allowed to make any laws but they will also ignore any laws that are inconvenient for them, even if they are the ones who made those laws in the first place. Republicans will rail against “the elite” while ignoring the fact that their policies are first and foremost designed to transfer more and more of the wealth of this country into the pockets of their already-wealthy supporters, who are, by any definition, “elite”.Democrats, on the other hand, actually acknowledge the fact that the vast majority of the people in this country are not wealthy, and therefore do not benefit in any way from most of the laws and regulations passed by Republicans. The Democrat Party’s ideals then are to advocate and legislate on behalf of all the people in this country, not just the wealthy ones. Of course, in today’s political system, they have the same need to raise a lot of money that the Republicans do, but they do that, for the most part, without ignoring the needs of the non-wealthy people in this country.In other words, Democrats in government, for the most part, do the jobs that they were elected to do, which is to pass laws that benefit the majority of the people in this country, even the ones who may not have voted for them.

Evangelical Christian: Yes. I’ve been a fan of The Handmaid’s Tale since I first saw the 1990 film, after which I read the Margaret Atwood novel, and am now following the Hulu series. And, contrary to whatever stereotypes the OP has in mind about evangelicals, I do not watch the show because I think it is some sort of utopia.I think it’s really something of an oversimplification to regard The Handmaid’s Tale as only some sort of commentary about evangelicals and the kind of future they supposedly want to live in. Religious conservatism is not the only moving part in what established Gilead in place of the United States. Environmental issues, for instance, are addressed by the revelation that the world suffered a drastic reduction in fertility owing to some man-made contamination of the planet. In addition to this, I can see aspects of the general alt-right, and specifically the Men’s Rights Movement and Incel adherents all allying with whatever radical religious elements were afoot, and Gilead is the end result.Sometimes when I watch The Handmaid’s Tale I can almost imagine it as a spiritual sequel to Fight Club, if Tyler Durden’s movement gained real traction, evolved into something far more oppressive, and eventually brought the U.S to this point.One of the funnier criticisms I’ve heard of the current series is how, in comparison to the original novel and movie, the racist elements of Gilead’s social structure had been removed in favor of a more racially balanced dystopia (The Biggest Problem With The Handmaid's Tale Is How It Ignores Race). People are upset about this because they feel it’s not doing enough, therefore, to be critical of conservative religious culture (or what many perceive it to be).

1,What is blackface?,Blackface,Jim Crow Laws,Racism in the United States of America,1!,1!,1!,"Short answer…”Black face” refers to the makeup used by a nonblack performer playing a black role.Long answer…Blackface is much more than just dark makeup used to enhance a costume.Its American origins can be traced to minstrel shows. In the mid to late nineteenth century, white actors would routinely use black grease paint on their faces when depicting plantation slaves and free blacks on stage.To be clear, these weren't flattering representations. At all. Taking place against the backdrop of a society that systematically mistreated and dehumanized black people, they were mocking portrayals that reinforced the idea that African-Americans were inferior in every way.The blackface caricatures that were staples of Minstrelsy (think: Mammy, Uncle Tom, Buck, and Jezebel) took a firm hold in the American imagination, and carried over into other mediums of entertainment.Blackface has also been seen in Vaudeville Shows and on Broadway. Yes, black actors sometimes wore blackface, too, because white audiences didn't want to see them on the stage without it.We have blackface performances to thank for some of the cartoonish, dehumanizing tropes that still manage to make their way into American culture.Beyond that, blackface and systematic social and political repression are so inextricably linked that, according to C. Vann Woodward's history The Strange Career of Jim Crow, the very term ""Jim Crow"" — usually used as shorthand for rigid anti-black segregation laws in force between the end of Reconstruction and the Civil Rights Movement — derives from an 1832 blackface minstrel number by Thomas D. Rice.",69,4,306,15,0,0

3,What is your opinion about/reaction to the recent Gallup poll showing that presidential moral leadership is less important to Republicans?,Gallup (research organization),1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"To me it makes a whole lot of sense. I think that republicans as a whole are being frustrated by how high “morality” is valued by democrats. I’m going to provide two examples to try and highlight why Republicans are frustrated with it.When I go to debate events for TFA (Texas Forensic League) a lot of kids choose to value morality. They more or less say that the most moral course of action is the best. So, if the question was “should NCAA athletes get paid?” a lot of kids would say “yes, it’s morally correct.” By doing this they manage to avoid having to look at whether or not it would be practical or doable. A kid who didn’t value morality might say, “while paying them is the morally right thing to do it would bankrupt college institutions. We should merely give them the right to make their own licensing deals.” This strategy of valuing morality has become popular with high school debaters because it is used by a lot of democrat politicians today, it’s a pretty good strat. Usually the kid who values morality whens the debate in my local tournaments against someone who doesn’t. But when republicans see it they become frustrated because they don’t think that we should just do what is right regardless of the consequences. Republicans don’t value morality over everything else.To provide a specific example of where democrats value morality over anything else I want to talk about the American gun control movement. The Democrats really use an ethics appeal when talking about it, they bring up kids who are pro-gun control and have them speak so as to why guns are evil and morally wrong. They try to portray gun control in general as “common sense.” It’s not like Republicans disagree with them, they just have a more logical appeal. Republicans really want to fix the background check system so that dangerous people can’t buy guns legally (Analysis | Why Senate Democrats are considering holding up a gun-control bill from one of their own). So it frustrates Republicans when democrats want to portray issues as “moral” or as a matter of right and wrong. Because what the democrats are effectively doing is trying to portray Republicans as evil for not agreeing with them.Republicans today care about morality less and less because they’re sick of democrats valuing morality so highly. And Republicans are sick of Democrats using morality as a tool to portray them as “evil” just because they disagree on how to fix the problem.",97,0,17,31,0,1

Every specific characteristic is a tool to use for winning. Any specific characteristic, including personal morality and moral leadership, is a “vitally necessary” if their candidate has it, a “not necessary” if their candidate doesn’t have it, a “smokescreen” if the other candidate has it, and a “deal breaker” if the other party’s candidate doesn’t have it.When Hillary was the Democratic candidate, Republicans smeared her personal morality at every turn and insisted that personal morality was absolutely vital in a president. With Trump as their candidate, “moral leadership” was reduced to “will nominate a Supreme Court Justice who might someday vote to make abortion illegal again”. Their candidate’s personal morality was a “not necessary”.My reaction? Not surprised by the way the core voted. But pleasantly surprised that many established GOP leaders, including both former presidents Bush, cared enough to not endorse Trump.

Small states are over-represented in the US Senate. More of the small states are red than blue. In the House of Representatives Democrats have to get 53% of the national vote in order to have a majority. Democratic voters are concentrated in big cities, so if you draw lines without regard to politics, you will probably end up with Democrats being under-represented. Of course, the party in power in the legislature tries to skew the districts in their favor. This is most often the Republicans. The electoral college favors small states because states get an elector for every representative, and an elector for each senator. In 2000 Gore got a majority of the popular vote, but only won 20 states. That meant 40 extra electoral votes for his opponent, votes awarded because of the placement of state lines over 100 years ago, not because the people expressed a preference for Bush. The Supreme Court is turning more conservative because presidents and senators who don’t represent the will of the majority choose the justices.(2) Voting based on emotion and culture, rather than economic reality. Republicans divide and conquer, because a lot of white working class people vote against Democrats who support rights and opportunities for ethnic minorities. In my home state of SC, GOP candidates for governor are claiming to be against illegal immigration while cutting funding for inspectors to check businesses for compliance with the law.(3) Money.

I am deeply, deeply well-read on political movements of the 20th century to the point I've researched primafacie documents right down to things like the actual NDSAP (Nazi Party) platform of Munich 1920, I do not have a degree in this area, however I have read more on this topic than I ever read in what my degree is in. I would describe my politics as neo-liberal, anti alt-right, anti alt-left, no party affiliation. That's my bias.Well, let's get this straight: most people who label themselves ""liberal"" in 2018 are leftist, NOT liberal. The modern left shares almost nothing with the liberal ideological pedigree. Because of this I think older, wiser, more knowledgeable generations understand the dangers of leftism and don't necessarily vote FOR Republicans, they vote against leftism. Because academia is so wildly left leaning it has exponged all of the damning evidence of the fascisms and totalitarian regimes of the 20th century being rooted mostly in leftism, and yes that DOES include the Nazi's, a socialist workers movement, rooted in activating youth activism, anti-Capitalist, huge proponents of a public education emphasis, nationalized health care, class warfare, obsessed with pointing out unfairness, strict gun control… and so on… it was eerily similar to this generation who values ""activism"" over ""acting better"". Those of us who are deeply knowledgeable and well-read on the topic know there is a danger from the alt-right but it is dwarfed by a very real and present danger from the left because most of the modern left IS alt-left and they can't even see it. From their very root axioms they are definitionally Neo-Social-Marxist, and the fact they are blind to it is very dangerous.I also think that to call ones self ""liberal"" carries some air of ""see, I'm morally superior to you"" and you don't even have to be a better person. It's the easiest path of least resistance, you don't even have to think, you just repeat cliche's and move along ""feeling better"" about yourself with no effort to be an actual better person. After all, your professors will give you better grades, beautiful rich actors and musicians will laud you, and most mainstream media sources will filter the news to tell you everything you hoped you would hear. It's easy to simply emote, repeat, and feel good about yourself and be convinced the ""other guy"" must disagree with me because he is a ""bad person"", it's getting to remain in childish bliss forever.It's also that liberals like to air their opinions on social media more where younger people tend to be, and because leftism survives by duping the ignorant younger people tend to be more liberal, and as one grows up, learns more, reads more, and sees how the world actually works, and also discovers that all the horrible accusations the left throws at conservatives are mostly hogwash one tends to be more conservative. My entire life there was always some supposed ""liberal revolution"" brewing with youth, but when people grow up they become more conservative. So, Republicans get elected because there is a silent majority rolling their eyes at the left and being sick and tired of being called nasty names or accused of awful things and go vote in secret. The illustration I like to use is liberals are the guy on the track who sees the conservative 10 steps behind him and smarmily laughs his smarmy laugh mocking him… not realizing he is NOT actually 10 steps ahead of him he IS merely 10 steps away from being entirely lapped.I also think leftists are more ""into"" politics, since they think the government's job is to fix all problems it tends to be more Utopian, whereas Republicans, since they believe things are best fixed by themselves are busy pursuing innovating, making the world better personally (btw, this is empirical that Republicans give more charitable $$'s and volunteer more) they aren't as ""into"" politics, so they DO more good and shoot their mouths of less about politics.Also, if you are referring to Quora, it has a reputation of using the BNBK policy in a biased way, if you are a partisan you just define ""nice"" and ""kind"" as ""anyone who agrees with my politics"" and you get fewer conservatives because we are used to that sort of thing.

The political parties began spending hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising in the media who was freed to serve these big spenders any way they wanted. This ruling also allowed media companies to take sides and even politicize their brand as Roger Ailes did with Fox News.Because the political parties are such big customers of media advertising and so much money is involved the media are not willing to report news that is highly critical of their biggest customers. The media has a huge conflict of interest. So for example when the DNC did not want the Sanders campaign given media attention the media complied.The two parties use the media to force a binary choice between two brands.

That played out well enough in Massachusetts, where we like our politicians to be at least a bit patrician, and our Republicans to be financially responsible technocrats, rather than Bible-thumping culture warriors.Romney tacked over to the right for his Presidential campaigns, becoming “severely conservative” in the name of appealing to the national Republican base.

If 2/3 of the senate finds the crime has been committed, they can remove the president from office.That’s the political part. And with this GOP, it’s pretty clear they will do nothing. That basically only means he gets to stay in office, that doesn’t clear him of actual criminal liability.But unless someone has a paper trail of Putin paying Trump directly with cash taken from orphans, and supplying him with policy directions, they’ll stick to their guns and claim ‘witch hunt’ because it doesn’t have to be correct, they just need to convince enough voters to stay in power.

Telling people with whom you disagree that they are evil is going to seriously bring down political and social discourse because I mean…why would you even talk to this guy if you think he’s a Nazi? Personally I’m a big fan of watching debates, from the brothers Hitchens’ face off, Bill Nye vs Ken Ham, Sam Harris’ ‘talk’ with Cenk Uygur, Ann Coulter (all her debates are great), Ben Shapiro’s debates, Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, Dinesh D’Souza, I’ve retroactively gone back and watched every presidential debate from Bush Sr onwards (and clips going back to Nixon vs JFK), a lot of Buckley’s Firing Line, Fry and Peterson vs Goldberg and Dyson, etc. I have noticed and increasing level of hostility (usually coming from the left of the aisle but not always) towards opponents. Recently when Peterson and Fry debates Dyson and Goldberg, we saw Michael Eric Dyson describe his opponent (Peterson) as a “mean, mad white man” and sit there while Peterson was talking making stupid noises rather loudly and obnoxiously and frankly childishly. When I was a kid and I was arguing with a friend or sibling, that was what you’d expect. Not from an adult for crying out loud. Dyson didn’t see Peterson as another human being who he simply disagreed with. He saw him by his immutable characteristics. He’s a white guy. That’s what he saw.There’s always the possibility that this will be good long term. The reason I say this is like when you’ve got a romantic couple or two friends and after a while they despise each other…and then they just say everything they’ve wanted to say about why they hate each other and what they should do to change and their life story (or have a fist fight in the case of two guys)…sometimes the relationship dies and sometimes it blossoms. Maybe ten years or so down the road we start to realise that the other people in this world aren’t all that bad they just have differing views and we live with each other. Personally I’m of the view that even during those old, classy debates such as the William F. Buckley’s Firing Line, even though everyone was respectful there’s a good chance that a lot of the lefties were on there thinking “f**ling fascist” while Buckley was looking back at them thinking “f**king commie” but they maintained their civility. So there’s a chance that when we’ve all been pushed to the extremes and have gotten everything we think off of our chests that then we’ll start to miss one another and be better together than before.

They clearly achieved that. There are good examples of “far right” and “far left” “advertising” that originated from Russian sources and was designed to antagonize and foment hatred. This is a technique the Russians have used for many decades to foment chaos in smaller countries, and the US intelligence services clearly see it - although the Trump officials want to deny it.Evidence also clearly shows that Putin had a grudge against Hillary Clinton because she called him what he is and he expected that she would make life rough for him if elected. So Putin clearly had a MOTIVE (a strong one) to defeat her, and much of the aforementioned advertising was clearly designed to spread untruths about her. Also, the Russian “advertising” appearing to come from the “far left” was clearly influential in promoting Bernie Sanders over Hillary.What is not entirely clear at this point is whether the Russian campaign had as its ulterior motive to help Trump win. The evidence is not as clear as I would like to see about this. It seems more likely that its goal was to help Hillary lose. This, of course, is one of the things Mueller’s team is investigating.What is also not entirely clear is the extent to which the Trump campaign actively colluded in such a campaign vs being duped by it. There’s plenty of evidence that they violated campaign financing and other laws, but it seems that in at least some of those cases they did so inadvertently because they lacked experience running a national political campaign.It is also obvious to me that if any of this had happened as part of Obama’s election, the Republicans would be all over it, with many investigations and accusations and such.

Around 2012 a cabal formed around Robert Mercer, a hyperwealthy would-be political fixer who’d already had some notable success making predictions on market conditions based in software aggregating datum pulling from social media cross-indexed with a number of other sources. Motivated by a stripped out and retooled version of libertarianism(to wit: He believes that individual american should only be valued by their currency generating potential, and that the extremely wealthy should suffer no constraints or restrictions to conduct business in any way they see fit. He’s also been caught on the record implying that any american incapable of generating income according to his metrics should be eliminated by attrition or direct action if need be no matter what their situation may be). He’d been making donations and trying to shake things behind the curtain quietly for years with little effect. Around 2014 he threw his weight behind Cambridge Analytica, a subsidiary of SCL group whom as you may know now from recent press coverage. A company that sought via software, machine learning, and big data harvesting to apply psychological warfare tactics to so-called ‘swing’ voters. More broadly, it is also intended to push public opinion inline with preset goals in statistically and strategically meaningful ways. You don’t have to move the majority, he noted. You just have to move the minority that the majority inevitably drifts along behind. You just have to push statistically meaningful numbers of cultivated people favorable to the end goal to the vote , and discourage those who weren’t favorable from voting altogether. His group proof-of-concept tested the whole engine on the Brexit vote, and it worked. Busy little kingmaker that he is, he immediately turned his attention to the upcoming US election salivating. First deploying it to push out a candidate favorable to his personal goals out to the front of a fractured party, and then to push the election itself with the full might of that parties tactical warchest force multiplying his efforts. However anyone feels about Trump, it’s important to remember he was selected and pushed through not because of any real personal relationship he had with Bob Mercer, but because he was the most likely to be amenable to further Bob’s long term goals.Bob finally got his wish. He got his cabals entry into Washington DC power brokering, using the RNC as a disposable condom stepping stone. He had the access to start positioning people who were either favorable to his weird, twisted idea of what america should be, or already onboard with his cabal to begin with. Many members of his group, like Bob himself have a publicly documented and deep standing contempt of the RNC that is only marginally less powerful than his outright hate of the DNC, and clearly view them as little more than a means to an end of staging an internal coup d’etat inside the halls of power itself. Whether he will succeed, or even be brought to trial for usurping the democratic process, hijack the fate of a nation, and bid to place himself plus his select few as the untouchable éminence grise of DC going forward largely depends on you, the people rising up in outrage. Of not getting distracted by a reality show reject who at best is a rubber stamping perfect-storm-of-distraction stooge, and at worst a colluder. Though I consider this latter possibility remote. The evidence i’ve examined point towards Mercer being the domestic instigator ultimate source, and his son-in-law being the most likely proxy to any interested foreign powers involved. I also do not see any convincing prima facie evidence of these two disparate elements having any collusion or meaningful contact with each other…Though i’d be hard pressed to believe that either was completely unaware of the other’s reach, impact, or capabilities just from the amount of press both have generated. In particular, i’d venture a strong guess that the RNC has a very short span to burn this cancer from their midst before Mercer positions himself and his own as gatekeepers of it’s free agency. Probably a handful of years, at best. But I have no way of guessing with any accuracy. It’s just a projected timeline based on their meteoric rise thus far. I do not believe that any american would want any small collective of psychopaths, a few corrupt individuals whom via software could move a nation where they wish it to go, via programs on cold machines could steer the ship of state as they see fit and to their own ends.Thank you for taking the time to read this.

During that time I studied the professiion, and one thing I found was that the people most influenced by advertising sincerely believed—and with absolute certainty—that they weren’t affected by advertising in the slightest.Republican voters have been proven to be highly susceptible to propaganda—just as the teens of Veles, Macedonia, could tell you. They make their living from fake news websites, but found that for Americans only the sites aimed at Republicans made them money. Reputable pollsters have found the same thing. Republicans will believe anything bad about Clinton and anything good about Trump, no matter how preposterous.But at the same time, as with advertising, Republicans believe that even if Russia did wage an all-out info war on America—which it did, according to all US intelligence agencies—Republicans believe that propaganda has no influence on them, so they think it doesn’t matter. That it’s a nothingburger issue, and many of them are really angry with Democrats for continuing to pursue it.Because they correctly surmise that it’s only important if they’re chumps.As Mark Twain said, it’s far easir to fool someone than to convince them that they’ve been fooled.This was a close election. Did the Russians elect their asset? No one will ever know. Many factors were in play, of which the Russian war on America was one. But so was many Republicans’ simmering rage over having had a black man in charge of them for eight years—a level of rage most Democrats have trouble imagining.Blacks have no trouble imagining this.If you don’t instantly recognize what this photo is from and about, you don’t know American history. And this was just that black girl’s first day. It went on like this for the whole school year. The one white girl who befriended her wound up having to move to another state with her family, due to death threats from the Klan. At one point a student passing this black girl in the hallway used a squirt gun to squirt acid in her eyes. It would have blinded her permanently if a security officer hadn’t acted as quickly as he did.And these people are mostly still alive. As is the racial animus they’ve passed on to their kids, and their kids.Google “Obama” and choose “Images” and see how many invoke racist stereotypes. The one about Obama being arrogant are the most telling. They invoke the white supremacist abhorrence of their worst boogeyman—an educated, intelligent black. What they would call an “Uppity Negro.” That’s not the exact wording, but you get the point.It’s not his policies they hate. It’s him. And the Russians knew this, and exploited it. Russian propagaanda operations can sometimes be crude—America is quite a different culture. I know a bunch of Russian expats, and I’ve seen this at work. But like their weapons (the AK-47 stands out), their propaganda is effective because they’ve spent over half a century refining the techniques that are most effective at steering public opinion—especially that of the least educated and most given to believing anything scary/shocking/triggering of prejudices…of storytelling designed to make the target audience feel threatened, aggrieved, persecuted by the Other—even when the Other is relatively powerless and the aggrieved ones are in the majority.The Soviets developed this because they knew they were militarily weak compared to the West. Their huge army of conscripts wasn’t nearly as good as the West’s, but they had the doctrine that if you can persuade a man not to fight it’s a lot cheaper and less dangerous than trying to kill him in a shooting war.The Internet has made it even easier to hide the source of the propaganda. Russia will never admit that it’s waging war on the West in general and America in particular. Why should it?

It contradicts the House committee, which is now run by Trump’s cronies. The Senate Committee states that they believe the intelligence reports - reports by all 17 intelligence agencies.It also appears that foreign governments provided millions of dollars in support of Trump’s campaign.

1,Is there evidence that George Soros is anti American or is he a victim of fear mongering?,George Soros,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"George Soros is a billionaire hedge fund manager who is known for his support of numerous liberal and far left causes through various organizations. He operates largely in secret so much of the details about his activities are unknown. He deserves much criticism because he is unethical and a hypocrite. A short list of his not so nice activities follows.Convicted of Insider Trading. In 1988, George Soros profited from inside knowledge of a takeover of a French bank (Societe Generale). He was eventually convicted in 2002. Soros lost repeated appeals including those with France’s highest court and the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). The ECHR determined that Soros knew he was breaking the law, yet Soros still has not paid the fines.Hypocritical Tax Beliefs. George Soros frequently says that rich people should pay more in taxes but built most of his initial fortune by exploiting tax loopholes. Soros deferred the taxes paid on fees by his clients which he then invested allowing them to grow. Bloomberg (a company most known for business news, data, and analysis) estimates that Soros amassed $13.3 billion just from these deferrals alone. The US government closed the loophole and ordered Soros to repay $6.7 billion. If George Soros really believes that the rich should pay more in taxes, this was the perfect opportunity to pay more – just abide by the law. Instead Soros responded by moving all of the money in question to Ireland, a known tax haven.Secret Attempts to Turn the US away from Israel and to turn Israel into an international pariah which can then be destroyed. Soros’ Open Society Foundation (OSF) has spent the last 8 years funding a clandestine network of groups to achieve this. The OSF promotes transparency and yet deliberately kept the source of the funding hidden.Illegally Overspending On Political Campaigns. Through George Soro’s group America Coming Together, spent $137 million in 2004, most of which violated federal election limits, in an effort to see John Kerry elected President.Broke the Bank of England. Through currency manipulation, Soros caused the British pound to crash wiping out 3.3 billion pounds from the government’s coffers, exacerbating a recession, and destroying the livelihoods of millions of people. George Soros doesn’t care how many people got hurt. All that matters to him is that he made one billion pounds.Broke the Bank of Thailand. Along with Julian Robertson, Soros attacked Thailand’s currency wiping out more than 60% of its value. When Thai’s central bank responded poorly, they closed in for the kill. Millions of Thais were left unemployed and impoverished while 600,000 foreign workers were forced to leave due to lack of work. The damage spread to the economies of Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Brazil, Russia, and sparked a violent revolution in Indonesia that killed several thousand people. But George Soros doesn’t care about any of that. The only thing that matters to him is that he made a lot of money.Tried to Destroy the Economy of Hong Kong through currency manipulation. It was only due to Hong Kong’s financial secretary Donald Tsang Yam-kuen that this attempt was thwarted. Yam-kuen sunk $118 billion Hong Kong Dollars into the stock market to block Soros’ currency manipulations. It cost the government and severely hurt Hong Kong’s reputation among financiers but it stopped a full meltdown which would have almost certainly triggered a world-wide recession.His so called Philanthropic efforts almost always serve his own pocketbook. One common tactic is to use “philanthropic” donations to open previously closed developing countries so he can take ownership of important assets in those countries at bargain prices. E.g. he gave millions of dollars of aid to Kosovo so that he could then buy a gold and silver mine worth over $5 billion for the bargain basement price of $50 million (only 1% of its worth).A few random items.George Soros financed much of the violent anti-Trump post election demonstrations. Many protesters were hired in response to advertisements for paid anti-Trump protesters that appeared in Seattle, Portland, Chicago, Pittsburgh, Boston, Denver, Philadelphia, New York, etc. There were organized efforts involving hundreds of buses transporting thousands of protesters to these “spontaneous” demonstrations.Soros colluded with various European big wigs to incite the refugee crisis.Soros owns the voting machines in 16 U.S. states which are to be used in the upcoming election.George Soros has major personality problems. Every 20 years, trades his current wife for a 20 year younger trophy wife. He is currently on his third wife. Soros is known for his mistreatment of women and has had numerous sex scandals. George Soros has a god complex. From his memoir The Alchemy of Finance,“To put it bluntly, I fancied myself as some kind of god.” Soros really believes that he is above the rules that apply to others.But liberals give generally give George Soros a pass on everything because he contributes money to liberal causes. Even his support to some of the liberal causes are really to butter his own bread. For example, George Soros has funded much of the pro drug legalization efforts of recent years. But what these groups will not tell you is that they are funded by George Soros and the Soros has positioned himself to profit from drug legalization by buying large tracts of land in South America and by forging alliances with South American Coca Leaf producers. George Soros is not a nice guy.Edit: Someone asked for some references, so here are some for the major (numbered) items.Convicted of Insider Tradinghttps://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/...https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bil...https://dealbook.nytimes.com/201...https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/...2.

The right has no problems with the Mercers and Koch’s doing exactly the same thing for their causes but single out Soros as doing something wrong when it goes against their ideasBillionaire philanthropist George Soros is reviled in right wing circles — not, of course, because of his vast wealth, which he earned as a good, old-fashioned capitalist, but because of how it spends it, i.e. on progressive social and political causes.He has therefore found himself the target of innumerable derogatory rumors and memes, most portraying Soros as a sort of mad “puppet-master” throwing his money behind “subversive” groups and candidates to achieve his master plan of reducing America to ruin.How do they know that’s his master plan, you ask?

I'm not sure I understand what you mean by using that word in this context. A narrative is a story line, and it is not used by one party against the other here.This “story” began when the very Conservative The Beacon hired Steele to investigate Trump's ties to Russia. Or it began when the Intel communities in several European countries, while surveilling Russians known to be close to the Kremlin (Putin), started to pick up on people on Trump's campaign team contacting, or being contacted by, said Russians. They then notified the FBI.Take your pick. Those two incidents must have happened almost simultaneously, and no Democrats were involved in ordering the now famous Steele dossier at the time.At some point The Beacon must have received information from Steele that wouldn't be harmful only to Trump, but also to the GOP. They decided to shut the investigation down. By that time, the FBI was on to what went on with certain people on Trump's campaign team. By that time, Steele was worried about what he had found out about several of Trump's people, and their vulnerability to classical, Russian Kompromat, or blackmail if you will. To him the FBI seemed uninterested in what he had told them, and as far as I understand it; he contacted the DNC to hear if they were interested in taking over his investigation where the Conservatives had left off. They apparently were. We don't know what the FBI knew at that point, but we know that they have verified a lot of the things Steel had found out.The Democrats’ “narrative” consists of them being represented in the House committees investigating this, and their wish to find out what actually happened. The “narrative” of the Democrats is aligned with the part of the global population that cares about what goes on in the government of the most powerful country on earth. It is also remarkably closely aligned with the never Trump Conservatives who knew who and what Candidate Trump was, and had been, his entire adult life.The only people who are scared stiff about what will come out of this in the end, are the people who are 100% certain that Trump will be exonerated (like he says he will) when the Mueller investigation comes to an end. Or what will come out of any of the other investigations, for that matter, but the Russia investigation in particular.Robert Mueller III is a Republican, appointed by a Republican, and approved of by the Republicans in Congress.The Democrats are simply represented in the Congressional committees that are investigating this.

3,If Donald Trump can pull off the peace talks with North Korea will that make him a better president than Bush and Obama?,George W. Bush,Democratic Party (US politics),1!,1!,1!,1!,"Against all answers here my would be certainly and undoubtedly yes. There is huge difference between how Westerners look on Obama foreign policy and how the people actually been effected by it does. Well, most times.Short summary for Obama foreign policy: He received the Nobel prize for peace for absolutely nothing moment after he won his first elections. Why? the European Nobel committee want him to justify the prize. So, how well he did that?First, shortly after he became the president N.Korea returned to its nuclear program. He failed to response.Then he turned his back to Egypt and supported the protests against the government of Mubarak, leading to that the Muslim brotherhood (very good friends of Al Qaeda and ISIS) came to power, just to be overthrown by the Egyptian army (not thanks to Obama). Egypt then strengthened its relations with Russia because it understood the US is not a reliable ally.Gaddafi was a dictator who supported terror, had secret nuclear program (that no secret service outside Libya knew about, but was very close to finalization) and anti American. He decided to come clean about his nuclear program, offered compensations for terror attacks supported by Libya and asked to improve his relations with the US, unconditionally. It worked good at the beginning but then riots against his dictatorship started. Without taking advise from congress Obama along with France and UK took out Gaddafi. Giving rise to ISIS there.Russia invaded Crimea, I’m not saying whether Russia was wrong or right, just saying that Obama failed to response, again. During Bush time Russia invaded Georgia but fast and decisive action of the POTUS then led to that its forces withdrawal from there in less than two weeks. Obama, the most pro-EU president ever, enacted- along with the EU, sanctions over Russia.In Syria, Assad used chemical weapons to massacre his civilian opposition. Obama drew red line but set a record as the first president that didn’t enforce it when it was violated. By that he showed weakness and invited Russia to enter the void he left there.His policy in Libya and Syria fueled the refugee crisis which in turn led to the Brexit. Irony, the most pro-EU president was actually ruining it with his reckless and clueless policies.I will not elaborate about that he ignored the Iranians that were protesting against the Ayatollahs regime and asking for US help back in 2009. I will not elaborate about the disastrous JCPOA agreement with Iran, signed against the congress opinion and against all of the US allies in the Middle East. Sure, the EU liked it- they could return to do business with Iran and low oil prices helped the EU to return to modest positive economical growth. They don’t think too much about how nuclear arms race in the Middle East, on their door step actually, could effect them in less than a decade (and the JCPOA promise just that).So, how can Trump do better?Like Trump or not, like his style or not- he’s effective.First, if he could get to workable agreement with N.Korea - one which give more freedoms for the citizens of N.Korea (even if only relative) and establish trade relations between North and South Korea (and perhaps Japan and the US too) it would be huge achievement, on historical scale, even with only partial denuclearization.Second, by withdrawing from the JCPOA Trump restored the trust of US allies in the Middle East. The Arab league, representing 22 Arab countries in the Middle East, greeted him for this bold decision, so does Israel. If restoring the sanctions (that Bush started in 2006) would lead to regime change in Iran or at least to its withdrawal from its highly aggressive policies in the Middle East (and beyond) that would be another achievement on historical scale.Currently, Trump, Israel and Russia are in negotiations to achieve stability in Syria. It’s possible that agreeing on stability in Syria would lead also to Russian policy change in Crimea and to major improvement in US-Russia relations. That could be another great achievement.Trump is far from being the idiot media outlets in the US make him look like. He managed savvy negotiations with the Chinese and analysis of his actions showed a well planed foreign policy.I think he’s aiming at these goals. He’s also aiming at Venezuela that already released American prisoner. Unlike Obama he wouldn’t fly to Cuba or any other country without making conditions first. He’s not afraid to use the huge economical and military advantage of the US, these are not decorations but tools in his opinion. He’s speaking business, not BS.",399,10,559,625,0,0

Had he addressed the problem of issuing mortgages to unqualified borrowers immediately after taking office, we could have avoided one of the most devastating economic losses in the history of our country.I suspect that nothing anyone could have done would have prevented Obama from being elected. Even conservatives I knew voted for him because they wanted to elect a black president and bring an end to the long history of racism in this country.Little did they guess that Obama would reinvigorate the division between people of color and the rest of the country. His entire administration was a constant scold for the sins of having once been a country that participated in slavery (never mind that we fought a long, bloody war to end it!), that enacted Jim Crow Laws (although we did enact Civil Rights legislation to change them), and that still faced inequality with regard to education and employment opportunity.Not that Obama’s administration changed anything — black unemployment increased, educational parity decreased, no effort was made to address the black-on-black murder rate in the urban inner cities, and general civility between the races, social divisions, and economic classes declined.At the same time, Obama was one of the most ineffective military presidents the U.S. ever had the misfortune to elect. His foreign policy consisted of an extended apology to the rest of the world for our existence as a country, and his economic policy was an attempt to strangle the business environment entirely.Trump’s rapid successes in destroying ISIS in Iraq, rejuvenating the economy, and restoring the confidence and competitiveness of the U.S. were the result of the right policy prescriptions, but were also due to the depths the United States had fallen to.",193,8,46,804,0,0

At present, Trump is inconsistent, arrogant, in denial, and has made a lot of very poor decisions. Can he roll back on them, reinstate Obama’s, etc. policies of before and adding some positive achievements of his own? Of course he can but he does need to not only make peace with North Korea but also do a deal with Iran and build on the positivity of what went before him for him to be as good as Obama was. Judging Trump now shows he is very near the bottom of the pile regarding presidents but it is really up to him if he wants to stay there or rebrand himself and achieve a few positive breakthroughs on the world stage. Or else he may get lucky with for example a bloodless overthrow of the Islamic Republic of Iran and a replacement with a moderate Republic of Iran that had nothing to do with him.All presidents’ reputation are often determined by luck. Jimmy Carter was a decent president but the Iranian revolution, Afghanistan invasion and the Iran-Iraq war all conspired to bring him down. JFK certainly had more to achieve but was killed in his prime. Richard Nixon achieved a lot of diplomatic breakthroughs and may well be one of the best modern presidents until Watergate overshadowed his many moderate policy achievements like opening up relations with China and improving relations with the USSR. Ronald Reagan was helped by the historic events of his time when a moderate USSR came into being and a lot of the cold war conflicts could be toned down for good.

I had a discussion the other day with an elderly woman who was certain Trump was ending social security and Medicare….and she received this information from the Trump campaign. I told her I was a news junkie and never heard anything remotely about this topic…in fact although I believe these programs need to be reformed to insure their survivability, Trump has not signaled that he had any intention of doing so.What I didn’t do was lecture her that the president does not have the Constitutional authority to change a law passed by comgress…despite the fact that Obama did it a lot. Executive actions and presidential memoranda are sesigned to help facilitate laws by congress to reduce the negative impact on citizens with regard to the new laws.What Obama did was use his authority as president to bypass Congress…which is not allowed. So why didn’t they fight him in court. Because the judicial process works very slowly and has many levels. At the lower levels, these were Obama appointees and so they would rule on his behalf.

Yep, there are plenty of cases of unescorted minors who show up at the US border seeking asylum.Second, what a number of people (and the OP is wrong to say “liberals” b/c it includes a wide range of people on the political spectrum) are upset with the Trump administration for their deliberate and intentional change in policy to separate children (including infants) from parents when they show up seeking asylum. This is from Slate: “Earlier this month, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced plans to criminally prosecute “100 percent” of migrants illegally crossing the border with Mexico. That essentially meant it suddenly became official U.S. policy to separate children from their parents whereas before families would usually be kept together in shelters while they underwent asylum or deportation proceedings. But when he announced his new policy Sessions outright said the separation of children and their parents would be inevitable and brushed off concerns by saying that it would send a clear message to potential migrants.” And this is from Vanity Fair: “As the Associated Press notes, the previous “catch and release” policy Trump and his administration cite as the reason for increased border crossings was put into place in 2008 by then-president George W. Bush, and was primarily created to combat the influx of children fleeing to the U.S. from Central American countries due to a surge of child-trafficking. Under Trump, however, that policy has changed. In the past, the Office of Refugee Resettlement traditionally placed unaccompanied minors—that is, children who cross the border withouta parent—in government-run detention centers. If a parent and a child came together, they would be processed together. In recent months, however, the Trump administration has begun forcibly taking children from their parents—some as young as one year old—and warehousing them in facilities far away from their parents, as if they had crossed the border alone.”Again, I’ll assume that the photo is indeed from 2014. If it’s a photo of a facility that is in compliance, then it’s a situation where two unaccompanied minors showed up at the border without parents. However, consistent with the new policy under the Trump Administration, if that picture had been taken in 2017 or 2018, it could be of children who arrived with parents and then were forcibly separated, even if their application for asylum was granted.As for the argument of “what were liberals thinking?”…it’s more than just liberals who are appalled at this Trump policy of deliberately separating children (even infants) from their parents: The Act Of Ripping Children From Their Families Is Un-Conservative",698,22,697,"2,068",0,4

4,What do you dislike about the Republican party and its followers?,Republican Party (US politics),Hate,1!,1!,1!,1!,"To start with, I don’t ‘hate’ Republicans any more than I ‘hate’ Democrats. Eli Wiesel wisely pointed out that the opposite of love is not hate, but rather indifference.Anywho, I remember the 90s.In the late 80s and early 90s, Tipper Gore and Hillary Clinton, along with a handful of other politically connected goons, were pushing for censorship of music.They even managed to convince congress to get a freaking committee together on the issue, and that committee requested testimony from Frank Zappa, Dee Snider (who is a genuinely decent man and the lead singer for Twisted Sister), and even JOHN FREAKING DENVER.That committee of politicians who were there to ‘protect the children’ from harmful music? Loooooooot of Republicans.By the way, they brought John Denver because they figured he would side with them against Zappa and Snider. After all, at worst they figured Denver wrote a song about liking weed, and Snider and Zappa had written much more horrific songs.Nope. Fuck that. John Denver turned out to be a hardcore free speech advocate, stunning stuffy Republicans who thought he’d back them. Plus, he had a great selection of Guild guitars, so I like him for that too I suppose.Zappa, for all the imagery, delivered a brilliant speech about tyranny and censorship.Dee Snider delivered a few famous lines when a politician asked him about ‘Sadomasochistic’ themes in his music, suggesting that there were no such themes in his music and that the politician had a filthy mind.It seems like around the early 90s, the Republicans picked up this nanny-state censorious bullshit and ran with it.Sure, two politically connected Democrat wives had a hand (Clinton and Gore) in pushing for the investigation, but it was mostly Republicans who seemed to threaten music producers that either they had to to do something, or politicians would legislate a solution.So, they created the ‘warning’ sticker that a ton of CD’s featured for years. Honestly, I haven’t seen it in a while, so maybe that died.Anyhow, Republicans didn’t stop there, though. Along with prompting from Hillary Clinton, Jack Thompson, and a few other idiots, they continuously tried to take on video games and their contents, claiming it was not a form of protected expression.Thankfully, they seem to have grown out of that phase, and now it’s Democrats who constantly want to censor things, but it’s still shameful that they allowed themselves to fall so deeply into the rabbit hole when it was convenient.Censorship, especially of music, is a chilling subject to discuss.Sure, it starts innocently. Oh, we’ll have no more talk of violence.Okay, so that just screwed metal, rap, and a lot of rock.Oh, and no more advocacy of terrorism. Alright, there goes a lot of punk and Irish folk music.Oh, no more singing about social issues, that’s too triggering. Goodbye the rest of punk music, and most folk music.Oh, and nothing offensive to anyone.

4,What do you dislike about the Republican party and its followers?,Republican Party (US politics),Hate,1!,1!,1!,1!,"The contradiction of their party’s core values.Many Republicans talk about small government. It came up when Kim Davis was facing trouble for refusing a gay marriage and when the controversy of the gay wedding cake was all over the internet. It also comes up as a counter to gun control, social safety nets, and pro-environment regulation. That sounds a lot like a libertarian ideology. I could respect them as wanting small government, if that’s actually what they wanted, but that doesn’t seem to be the case, as my answer will detail.For one thing, the small government solution to the war on drugs would be to legalize the drugs. Guess which party is closer to wanting that. If you said the “small government” Republican party, you’d be wrong. Neither party platform is for across-the-board legalization, but the Democrats are closer with marijuana legalization.What about intervention abroad? Are the “small government” Republicans also against unnecessary use of the biggest government program known as the US military? I’ve always found the opposite- that the party for small government wants to use the military much more than the idea of “small government” suggests.There are other points I could talk about, some as prevalent as the ones above, some mostly advocated by crazies. These include, but are not limited to:Being tough on crime/criminals, sometimes to the point of wanting to go against the Bill of Rights (looking at you, Scalia).Advocating Christian prayer in schools.Wanting immigration to be difficult.Advocating laws telling people where to shit.Voter ID laws.The sheer quantity of people wanting to legislate behavior based on what they believe to be moral (usually sexually).Not everything on that list is intrinsically bad as an ideology.

So increasing big government and their ability to interfere in its citizens lives is now ok?Again, small government: so Republicans day they are against government telling people how to live their lives… except when it’s telling women what they can or can’t do with their own bodies? Hmm…The supposed party of Fiscal Responsibility: You know where I am going with this one. They just blew up the deficit by 1.7 Trillion dollars in tax cuts and giveaways to the rich with absolutely no sound economic justification. Now they are desperately trying to find ways to find money to cover this hole by cutting… you guessed it, Medicare and programs that mostly benefit the working class and poor. Incredible! It seems they believe in “fiscal responsibility” only when Democrats are in power or to take away resources that help citizens who are poor and/ or minorities.Party of Christian Family values? Yes, that is why they stand behind a man who has married three times, a serial liar, braggart, selfish man who is a womanizer and adulterer who slept with at least one porn star and then paid her off so she would talk. Yeah, I can see how he might represent your “family values”.When the President is a Democrat they defend the “moral sanctity” of the office of the presidency: If the current President happens to be Republican, then all of a sudden they are blind, deaf and dumb to all the morally questionable things Trump says and does on a daily basis.The party of law and order? So if there is even the faintest whiff of wrongdoing by a Democrat we must respect our law enforcement agencies and give them space and all the resources and time necessary to get to the bottom of any wrongdoing. And if during said investigation evidence of other possible misdeeds should be uncovered then they should also be investigated until the end of time. Because our law enforcement agencies can do no wrong.That is until the one being investigated happens to be Republican. Then all bets are off. Republicans use every trick in the book to undermine our law enforcement agencies and derail the investigation. All of a sudden there is a intense need to “wrap up” all investigations as soon as possible. These same Republicans now question the integrity of our FBI, intelligence agencies and anyone else who dares investigate any Republican wrongdoing. Apparently law and order only applies when Democrats are in power.Party of patriots? Who look the other way when Trump (a draft dodger and a coward) insults and attacks the integrity of Senator John McCain, an actual war hero.Parriots part 2: These are the “patriots” who pretend as if a hostile foreign power (Russia) actively tried to interfere in our presidential elections and the very real possibility that their candidate colluded with them to undermine our democracy. They are such patriots that they don’t seem to notice how strangely deferential Trump seems to be with Putin of Russia and his strange silence whenever Russia commits acts that are aggressively against the best interests of the United States. Is it me or does no one in the Republican Party worry about the very scary possibility that Russia might have compromising material on the president of the United States? Apparently their “patriotism” blinds them to this possibility.Going back to the original question, why do I hate Republicans? Because they have failed America and as they currently stand, they are actively undermining everything America stands for, including our democracy. They demand that Democrats be held to standards that they refuse to hold themselves to.I hate Republicans because they put their own interests above the interests of our country and have acted in such a way that tells me they would be willing to blow up our democratic traditions and institutions if it means staying in power.

Because it gives the person watching a reason to continue watching. They’re not interested in dry statistics or long boring factual arguments.

From your own question (which isnt a question.. its a statement with a question mark)hundreds of children are dying from school shootings while conservatives turn down legislation that could prevent itFirst - which legislation are you referencing? The ones that ban some guns but not others and do nothing to address the fact that the guns could have been swapped out with another model to the same effect? Or the laws that prohibit folks from using guns to commit murder (like how folks are prohibited from committing murder, but they do anyways)? Lets look at the San Antonio shooting.. Kid used two guns, and killed 10 people. Or maybe use the VT shooting in 2011.. yeah, its dated.. just what I can pull off the top of my head where I know for a fact the guns aren’t covered by any of the bans… 33 dead, including the shooter, so 32 losses to society. Not really that far off from the shooting in FL where the person used an AR.. but yet the laws truly ignore that it isnt the AR that is the issue.. two examples above prove its quite easy to use a different gun and get similar results.. Its the murder issue we need to be addressing.And hundreds of children are dying..Last year under 50 people died in school shootings. There were roughly 130 injuries and deaths combined last year in school shootings… If you’re looking for honest dialog, lets be honest.. there isnt hundreds per year.. There hasnt been 100 in a year since before sandy hook.. Matter of fact, you don’t hit hundreds (pulural, meaning more than 1 x 100 or multiple hundreds.. 200 or more) until you combine more than 3 years together. There have been a total of 438 injured, and still under 200 actually died in the last 6 years. We don’t even hit hundreds of deaths yet in a 6 year span.After Sandy Hook, More Than 400 People Have Been Shot in Over 200 School ShootingsNow, can there be things to protect our children? Sure.. how bout treating schools like every other place we protect. I find it funny, we have armed guards at banks at the entrance, cameras, and officers regularly patrolling around the area. We lock away what is being protected where nobody but authorized people can get to it. What do we have in schools.. 1–2 to cover 2–3 floors or buildings, with a MUCH higher density of people. How bout one where we protect important people (which our kids definitely qualify)? Armed body guards in reach, metal detectors at each door, bomb squad clears the area and background checks are ran on every person allowed entrance (they do this for the president).. They have snipers surrounding the area.. Again, we protect with guns, we harden the environment. Ok, maybe we dont want presidental level security.. lets go to congress. Armed guards (multiples at each entrance and exit). Arranged arrival and support times from the local police and pentagon protection forces. Everyone goes through a metal detector, and are wanded or patted down if the detector goes off… No vehicles allowed near buildings. Ok, still too much, we dont care about our children that much? Lets look at airports… Must walk in, armed security on premises, only allowed to the causeways after getting xrayed and felt up by tsa, random spot checks…Funny, we protect our schools by having unlocked doors, multiple egress and ingress points, very few actually have cctv or a centralized security group, and they have one or two resource officers. Not enough to even secure ONE door. Maybe we should stop treating our children as an expendable resource and start protecting it like we do our money.. Lets put 2–3 officers near EVERY door. Force a walk through a metal detector (for everyone.. not just students). How bout using a man trap (a short room or hallway where you enter it, the door closes, and then the other can be opened) with security watching it.. have it be the location for the metal detector. Cant open the door if the detector trips… You know what this will do.. it will force the school shooters outside. They won’t do the shooting indoors, they’ll do it outdoors… with weapons not covered by your bans.The gun rights advocates are all about reducing the needless firearms related deaths. Matter of fact, our goals are even more lofty.. we want to reduce ALL needless deaths.. drugs, guns, knives, baseball bats, etc. Guns, while an easily villifiable target, especially in high emotion times after a mass shooting, is one that can be looked at… but lets be honest with ourselves.. school shootings account for less than a percent of the deaths by guns every year (and I dont count suicide in those numbers)… So while you’re over there screaming “think of the children” and telling us to ban the items used in the most public shootings.. We will continue to laugh at your attempts.. because apparently the other 8000 deaths by guns that aren’t suicide that happen by ones and twos in the cities aren’t even part of your message. You want to reduce needless gun deaths.. look at the motivations, not the tool used.",35,0,101,865,0,1

And if they don’t get these things, they get so mad, feel so personally wounded, that they start to act in line with those limited emotional needs instead of in line with a broader picture.For example, conservatives oppose policies that give cops the right to distinguish gun owners from felons, even while those same conservatives pretend that they support both cops and gun owners. No rational person, let alone a conservative, would oppose the right for a cop to know whether a person they’re about to interact with is a legal gun owner; neither would any rational person, let alone a conservative, believe that legal gun owners should have no way to prove that they’re legally allowed to own guns.

In the nearly 100 years since women have been able to vote, only one woman has been a serious candidate for president, and she lost to the least qualified opponent in presidential history.So, who's voting for all of these men? Both men and women. I don't doubt that there's some role of identity politics, but given the very low representation for women over the last century, it's clearly not the main driver.",232,12,14k,"6,948",0,0

They are broad coalitions, out of electoral necessity. A party completely dominated by evangelicals would be limited to the South, and unable to win national power. A party dominated by genuine fiscal conservatives would be electorally annihilated everywhere except the districts immediately surrounding economics departments.Instead the different factions in the party get some of what they want, and give up any real chance of getting anything more, by subscribing to a broader but vaguer “conservatism” that aims to keep social structures, including but not limited to the role of government, as they believe they traditionally were or should ideally have been. Fiscal conservatives may not particularly care for the role of religion, but they don’t see it as harmful and are happy enough to go along with it on the grounds that churches might provide social services more cheaply. Evangelicals may not particularly care about government budgets, but are happy enough to see various income transfers as subsidies for immoral behavior that should be abolished. And so on.As it happens, the actual role of the religious right in the Republican Party is diminishing. While the party is still overwhelmingly supported by “evangelicals” as a demographics group, this has little to do with their religion as the fact that evangelical more or less equals southern baptist more or less equals white, working class southerner.

You want to talk about greed? Let’s get into the left wing mentality about how everyone is “entitled” to all these services - free housing, education, food stamps, healthcare, etc. They get all of that at the expense of other people. People who have worked hard to pay for what they have, and no have to pay for others who don’t work, but expect the same quality of life. Conservatives believe that people should keep what they earn. The left believes that they’re entitled to what you earn. Explain how conservatives are “greedy” now.Bigotry? Tribalism? This is seriously coming from the side of the aisle so wrapped up in identity politics that it blinds them to any sense of reality and costs them elections. Saying “illegal immigrants have no right to be here” isn’t “bigotry”, it’s basic common sense. A nation must have borders, and it is the citizens of that nation who decide to let into them. The default position is that you can’t come - but we’re very generous about who we do let in. We are not obligated to do anything for those who come without invitation.We are now at the point where “bigotry” includes an understanding of the differences between men and women, and admission with the biological realities of the two sexes. People are either male or female, this is determined at conception, and is ingrained at a basic DNA level. A man who decides to put on a dress and call himself Sally is not a woman, no matter how many birth control pills he takes, no matter how many ethically challenged doctors perform unnecessary and surgeries to maim healthy body parts.

How come liberals believe in wasting money? How come liberals want a tyrannical government which oversees everything?”Because it turns out a few minutes (and I really do mean a very few) of research shows that that’s not the liberal position.

That’s utter nonsense. Even if they wanted it, and even if Congress wanted to grant it, it is still legally impossible for it to happen that way, for two main reasons:The US Constitution only gives Congress the power to create new states, not give them up.The US Constitution guarantees that all citizens in each and every state will not be deprived of all the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States. That means they cannot either force or allow California to secede, since that would either deprive millions of US citizens of their citizenship, or force them to move to a different state, which is also an unconstitutional breach of their rights.And then of course there is the human angle. Do you honestly think for even a second that such a thing could even be attempted without triggering either a massive uprising or an outright civil war? Every state would see itself in California’s place, cut out of the herd and tossed aside on the altar of partisan politics, if not on behalf of the Republicans, than later on behalf of the Democrats.Now some people might claim there is one legal way for California to become independent without wanting to: a Constitutional amendment. That would have be to ratified by at least 38 state legislatures in order to be enacted. Right now the GOP only controls 32 state legislatures, and they may be about to lose two or three more in a matter of months.But alas, that is also unconstitutional without California’s affirmative consent.

They will leave things like farm subsidies out of budget cuts, along with things like ethanol, calling these subsidies matters of national security and defending them even while rightly denouncing government subsidies in other areas.[1]So bye bye subsidies.Second, I’m killing special corporate protections and privileges. They are a monstrosity that threaten the very foundations of the free market and create all sorts of problems in society.For example, congressionally mandated caps on liability on damages and economic losses suffered as a result of offshore drilling spills was a major cause of the Deep Horizon oil spill. These stupid and reckless government policies protect businesses from being liable for damage they cause and skew cost benefit analyses, making it more profitable to cut corners and act irresponsibly because of government protections. When businesses think that their liability is limited, and that the benefits outweigh the risk of costs incurred by causing disastrous damage to people’s property thanks to all these special privileges, companies are not going to take steps to try to ensure that they are handling things in a safe manner.[2]All the government is doing here is creating more problems. They shouldn't be subsidizing these industries, giving them selective benefits, they shouldn’t be banning offshore drilling, they shouldn’t be granting special government protections to decrease the liability of companies if things go wrong, they should keep their nasty little hands out of all of it and let things play our on their own.This sort of thing, along with other liability caps like those included in the Price-Anderson Act, are all going bye bye.I would also try to extricate the US from foreign conflicts and wars whenever possible. The role of the U.S. military should be to defend only our country and perhaps our allies from foreign invasions, to protect U.S. Citizens and ensure their safety, not interfere in the affairs of other countries.You can generally expect a much more libertarian governance from me than what you see with most Republicans in office, ending the war on drugs and legalizing them all, making it significantly easier to immigrate to the United States legally, etc, etc, etc.Footnotes[1] Republicans Are Weak on Farm Subsidies[2] How the Liability Cap Helped to Cause the Gulf Spill",1.8k,98,1.1k,276,1,2

Republicans claim to be the party of fiscal restraint, but the last Republican president to reduce spending was Dwight Eisenhower. The last Republican to actually reduce the size of government was Calvin Coolidge. 100 years ago, Republicans actually kept their promise not to grow government. If you cut the federal budget in half, you not only reduce the debt and balance the budget. You also create the biggest private sector expansion since then end of World War II.The same Coolidge also kept America out of never ending foreign wars. Republicans used to brag about being the party of non-intervention. But President Bush proved that Republicans really love blowing things up. We have soldiers firing missiles that cost more than their annual salaries killing an enemy who makes less money in their entire life than that one missile. Expand free trade, lift people out of poverty. Stop poking the hornet’s nest.End the failed war on drugs. Stop incarcerating millions of Americans for using a plant. Decriminalize all drugs. Legalize marijuana. Not only would that save billions in law enforcement, the tax revenues would allow the government to cut taxes on everyone else. Let the potheads fix the pot holes. Non drug users pay none of the taxes.Leave people alone. You should be able to do what you want, so long as you aren’t harming anyone else. I can take care of myself.

It’s too complicated. We’ve gotta figure out how to simplifying healthcare billing. We’re not going to be able to implement a system exactly like what they have in Europe, China, Canada or Japan etc, but we can learn from them and figure out a solution. I would NOT just try to repeal Obamacare like an idiot. It’s not going to involve “bipartisan” solutions - which is what they kept saying in 2017 when they were trying to repeal Obamacare. It’s going to involve logical solutions.Immigration - Take away all the rules preventing law enforcement officials from asking for legal status documents.

I would do the same thing the media does. Post about all the people who get rear ended by uninsured undocumented immigrants. I would set up deals with other countries such as Canada to take some of the refugees coming to the US.

If they don’t want more refugees than they’re already getting, and they want to give us the “life’s not fair” shtick, then we’ll put it right back on them and just start shipping the refugees there anyway with a grin.

As “shareholders”, or “stockholders” in the corporation they share in the profits but are only liable to the extent of the assets in the corporation.This form of business ownership has been enormously successful; it has been a means of creating wealth, especially in the West where it originated and has been used for centuries.Besides the “owners” or stockholders”, the average corporation hires people to manage it, to work at whatever form of business it engages in; it also has suppliers, accountants, possibly consultants, and, of course customers.

If you want to use this non-constitutional statement to control Christians in other circumstances, you have to be consistent and not allow the government to dictate anything about a Christian.[And it might be interesting for you to note that there is absolutely no law against a teacher teaching Creation in a public school.And in my Children's school, their principal always prays over the intercom after the Pledge of Allegiance every morning. And before every assembly they have, He prays then too. And He has been doing it for at least 5 years now (that's how long my kids have been in school) and no one has stopped him.]",140,3,439,"3,486",0,0

Every year my kids teachers get thank you letters and more if I can afford it, I am an American citizen, it is my obligation to encourage our societies helpers to continue their work.I will say - I hit the rough pretty hard when I read about a little girl that's family were atheists. She went to be treated by the school nurse at a public school and all children were required by her to say the pledge to the flag or they would be refused medical care. She refused (good girl, standing up for her personal beliefs!) and was sent to the VP office who STILL tried to get her to say it. She refused, I am glad her body will heal her spirituality would have a rough time of it. I sent some pretty extensive emails, physical letters, and phone calls to the school district. I read later on, they apologized to the girl (in elementary school!!!!!) and had received much input from the article from around the nation. That made me happy, I maybe a Christian, but I am a US citizen who would introduce the tenets of my faith in a private matter never secular if it was welcome. It is my duty as a military veteran and Christian not to shove my faith down a little girls throat and refuse her medical care if she doesn't want to take my faith. I hope you get my point here.

But today this has morphed into a grievance based movement which looks at Trump as a way to “win"" over those who disagree with them, or as a way to publicly part of a group that accepts their far right beliefs.

1,Why does the GOP (Republican) platform still support teaching about intelligent design.

This is to say that when you have a child, on average it takes 20 years for your child to have a child. Therefore in a human lifetime it’s difficult to see evolutionary change in typically no more than four generations.Bacteria on the other hand reproduce in 20 minutes. And unlike humans, they reproduce exponentially rather than linearly. For nearly a decade I was a practicing Microbiologist (I know; rather strange for a Physics major) and I have witnessed evolution first hand. Bacteria have several repair mechanisms and when under chemical or photo-chemical duress, the few that survive will breed a new colony that are more and more resistant to the prior chemical or photo-chemical challenge. This is how we ended up today with drug resistant bacteria.Many of those critical of evolution would argue the leap from a minuscule single-celled organism to a large and complex multi-cellular organism (humans) can’t be explained. It’s a really good challenge.Bacteria are minuscule single-celled organismsMissing Link (magic happens here)Advanced Multi-cellular Organisms Evolve.To begin, allow me first to flip the argument around – how is it that a minuscule single-celled organism upon entering a large and complex multi-cellular human body, can overwhelm the human immune system resulting in death. Think about this… It's not like a couple bacteria get in you and they start secreting some toxins -- you're enormous, that would have no effect on you. You're huge.We now know that virulence is the process whereby pathogenic bacteria get in you, they wait, they start growing, they count themselves with tiny little chemical molecules, and they recognize when they have the right cell number that if all of the bacteria launch their virulence attack together, they are going to be successful at overcoming an enormous human host. Bacteria always control pathogenicity with this process called Quorum Sensing – a chemical language that bacteria use to communicate with one another. [1]This is the invention of multi-cellularity. Bacteria have been on the Earth for billions of years; humans, couple hundred thousand. We now understand that bacteria made the rules for how multi-cellular organization works.This is exactly what happens in the human body. It's not like your heart cells and your kidney cells get all mixed up every day, and that's because there's all of this chemistry going on, these molecules that say who each of these groups of cells are, and what their tasks should be. Bacteria invented Quorum Sensing, and humans just evolved with a few more bells and whistles.So we have discovered the missing link…Bacteria are minuscule single-celled organisms…that evolved to create chemical methods to work in unison, functioning in the very first multi-cellular fashion known as Quorum Sensing…that evolved to advanced multi-cellular organisms.And we know without question that bacteria developed this multi-cellular functionality, because that’s exactly how virulence works in the human body.[1] https://www.ted.com/talks/bonnie...",135,1,20,167,0,1

One company, Harley Davidson, took the money from its tax cut, gave its shareholders a nice dividend, bought back a large chunk of its stock(about $650 million worth of stock), and announced to a plant in Missouri in which 800 people worked, that the plant would be permanently closed and operations would be moved to Pennsylvania where about 500 people would be employed. That’s a net loss of about 300 jobs. Nice!Most businesses have made it clear that the corporate tax cut was not going to change anything about future investments. Apple CEO Tim Cook announced when he approved a bonus for Apple employees which was about the same time of the corporate tax cut, stated publicly that billions in Apple investment here in the U.S. would have been done with tax cut or without tax cut. A small portion of employees are getting one time bonuses but no real increase in wages for the long term.Deregulation? You should worry. Why? Read on.The Financial Modernization Act (the legislation that voided the Depression Era Glass/Steagall Act) singed by former President Bill Clinton toward the end of his second term, 1999 I believe. It was about 9 years later, that the financial meltdown of 2008 hit the economy like a runaway Mack truck. The result was the deepest recession since the Great Depression of late 20’s/early 30’s. The recovery took a great deal of time to rebuild economic momentum. Although congress passed the Frank/Dodd Act, the legislation was not nearly as strong as the earlier Glass-Steagall. To add insult to injury, Wall Street just got nice big wet kiss from Congress, in that Frank-Dodd is essentially void. Setting the stage, yet again, for another financial crisis that the taxpayers will be on the hook for.A great many like to talk about Ronald Reagan and the economic boom that took place in his second term. Reagan’s tax cuts did not give the U.S. that economic boost, it was the defense build up and the deficit spending that moved the economy. Tax cuts DO NOT drive economic growth. It is a lie that the republican party will only cease when the earth is swallowed by the sun when it reaches red giant phase. DEMAND for products and services drives economic growth. Most companies are not investing in new facilities or capacity.If you want another look at tax cuts and how well they drive economic growth. Just look at Kansas Gov.

The current propaganda that is being thrown about that California is “all liberal” and “welcoming to subversive elements”, “is ALWAYS majority liberal”, etc — has nothing to do with Party, but much to do with portraying California as something it is not.California has had, and will continue to have Republican Governors —and all it will take is for them to be on the level of previous ones elected - be elected, or win in a recall. That’s democracy. It was only 2011 that the last Governor WAS a Republican, and that was Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.

Lies.I’ve lived in California for several decades and my next line will blow a lot of minds out there..but the big secret is..California is a ‘moderate’ State. Not quite Republican (Conservative) and not quite Democratic (liberal). It does gauge in the middle of both. The problem comes in when the Candidates are EXTREME one way or another. The Republicans that were Governors had moderate views more than completely extreme — Schwarzenegger being the “most” moderate Republican, where as Pete Wilson being the most conservative. And if one just takes a minute out to CONSIDER a bit of History, they will find that California majority of Governors..have been…Republican!!

One thing democrats often forget about the growing Hispanic + black population of California is that despite party affiliation, both groups hold highly Christian and highly conservative values. Black Californians famously led the electoral opposition against gay marriage when it was first on the ballot in California. Had it been a whites only vote, the bill likely would have passed. Minorities tend to be more pro life, less open to mass immigration, more anti gay marriage and support more traditional gender roles than do white liberals. Eventually California liberals will have just pissed off too many Californians and just have no excuse to blame republicans given their lack of power in California.I think both parties are very flexible and malleable. In other words, I could quite easily see Republicans making their party seem more diverse and pushing more black and Hispanics into higher positions to try and get over the fake claim that it’s a racist party. I think there will come a time very soon in which not only are whites a minority there, but they’re a small minority. By this time it’s likely that the GOP will have many Hispanics in prominent positions and after immigration finds some sort of balance and consistency, the democrats lose the ability to use immigrants as pawns for their schemes and rather than vote to stay in the country or to get special privileges we actually see all of those conservative blacks and Hispanics shift to the GOP…combined with the already significant number of white Republicans in California, they could get a Republican Governor.

Visitation or return of the children is contingent. This is done with US citizens. It isn’t ideal for the child either, but the US cannot automatically or magically fix the parents.Smuggling a child into a country or, sending them unaccompanied (to meet a contact or relative, a more and more common occurrence) from a legalistic perspective, demonstrates the parents willingness to put their children at risk.Maybe the solution is a very fast turnabout, allowing the parents to admit their guilt, be fingerprinted and documented, and then sent back across the border with their children?

4,What are Republicans most afraid of?,Republican Party (US politics),Fear,1!,1!,1!,1!,"SpidersJust the other day, I was sound asleep like many other republicans, when my brother knocked on my door at four o’clock in the morning. “Bryce” my brother said, “help me kill this big ass spider”. Now, a lot of things are running through my mind. First and foremost, is that I want to see this so-called, “big ass spider”, beyond that, I also ask myself why my brother is waking me up at four in the morning, and why he needs help killing a spider; He’s twenty one years old, why would he need my help?I don’t blame him.Now, for those of you in other parts of the world, you might laugh at what we here in Arizona consider to be a big spider. We’re used to daddy long legs spiders, those tiny ones with the super long spindly legs, like the web they spin. However, this was a new beast entirely, one that neither my brother nor I had ever seen before. One that had found its way firmly on our bathroom towels.This fucking monster.So we’re sat in our bathroom looking at a spider the size of a quarter, with our only fear being that it moves. So we start brainstorming on how to get rid of it. Now my brother first reached for the tried and tested method of the bucket and paper, as many of you know, where you place the bucket over whatever you want to get ride of, and slide the paper under it. A common method for removing geckos from our house, but a spider? I wouldn't dare try.And so, chemical warfare it is.A jug of this stuff, to be precise,That spider faced a biblical flood of poison that not even Noah’s ark could withstand, and with that, he flipped over, and curled up. Now what? We couldn’t risk sweeping him up, he might still be alive after all, playing dead as he liquefied in the toxic sludge we coated our bathroom in. Ah, the bucket and paper, that will be our solution.With the speed of a formula one pit crew, my brother got the bucket over the most likely deceased quarter sized bathroom spider, and slid the paper under it. While most people were preparing to wake up and begin their morning, we were in the middle of the street, with a bucket and a piece of paper, inside of which is a spider. Gently, we placed the bucket onto the asphalt, and backed away.Now what? we have to get our bucket back, and we can’t just leave it in the middle of the street. But what if the spider is still alive? What if it moves again?The solution was obvious at the time.Punt that bucket into the fourth dimension.At the end of the day, the spider was indeed dead under that bucket, very much so. We got our bucket back, and I went back to bed, all is well that ends well. Didn’t sleep to well after that though, because if a spider was hiding on the towels, a spider could be hiding in a million other places on my bed, and thus, I, a republican, am most afraid of spiders.",157,1,234,169,3,0

He was genius within himself, but most of experts credit him for his ability to not only bend the reality, but also be flexible to work with anyone and adopt their ideas as ‘his own’.Why is Steve Jobs case important here — because in most of the political situations we forget that we are all deficient with our ideological alliances to Brands, Religions, and Political banners. If we treat each other as individuals and focus on results, the differences really don’t count.

People don't remain in the GOP despite…The one most significant flaw in the U.S. system is that we essentially devolve politics into us or them. Two parties. The system is designed to funnel money and alliances into one or the other organizations. Yes, others can (and do) exist but because of how it all works, we naturally end up with this party or that party: pick your poison.Seriously, when almost everyone in the country is pointing out that in the last Presential election, the least worst ended up winning, we can't at least come together as people and agree that something is amiss? People didn't vote Republican because Trump. Trump won because no one wanted either but one of the parties was going to win no matter what and most States felt he was the least objectionable.And that's what the public has to do because though we can effectively vote for whomever, at the end of the day, our party affiliation is all but required so that we can vote in primaries. Sticking with the Democrat Party is the only way anyone can even have a chance of preventing another Clinton from railroading a very popular Sanders. Sticking with the GOP is the only want the public might even have a chance of preventing (or favoring) another Trump.If we don't stick with the parties, we can change the outcomes because even if a great many of us move to a completely different party, the entire system is institutionalized such that those primary two parties are ingrained. A massive percentage of the population needs to shift, and agree on the shift, to a third party for any such thing to really work.And we often stick in those parties for that reason not because we even necessarily like that candidate but because between the two parties, we tend to agree with respective party's views.I find, for example, that my political views tend to be much more Libertarian but I don't register as part of the Libertarian Party because I want my primary opinions to influence the outcome of the more likely party winners. That's not a good thing, but it is the reality. I stay in a given party so that I can ensure my voice matters in the more likely outcome. Unfortunately.That's broken.

What is a ‘liberal’? What is a ‘conservative’? You get the picture. But for the sake of this debate, let’s assume we are all agreed on those two terms - broadly that ‘conservatives’ are more those who are inclined to stick with the status quo and if they agree to change, are keen to do so slowly and cautiously.‘Liberals’, on the other hand (and I shall now drop the irritating quote marks) as a rule regard themselves as progressives, keen to bring in changes which they feel are in some way necessary - socially, economically, morally etc.(NB We should be cautious to regard as intellectually liberal all parties which choose to include the word ‘liberal’ in their name. Many such parties, especially in the less democratic countries, are anything but and include the word in a cynical attempt to gain a little respectability.)I suggest that my definitions above pretty much answer you question without going into specific issues on which the two might disagree.Naturally, there are all kinds of folk who regard themselves or are regarded by others as either conservative or liberal. For many conservatives ‘liberal’ is almost a term of abuse - I was once, as a far younger man, described by my father (who described himself as a ‘right-wing radical, whatever that means) as ‘dangerously liberal’. Conversely, calling someone a ‘conservative’ is for many liberals, especially the more stupid among them, damning a man or women to hell.That is not to say I regard liberals (or conservatives) as stupid per se, just that both groups have a fair share of stupid people in their ranks, and usually the more stupid they are, the more doctrinaire they are, insisting that they are right and there can be no other view.

In 2012, the Obama/Romney race cost almost $2bn. Two billion dollars! What does that buy? Well, I ran some numbers through my calculator. It would completely pay off the approximate student loans of 67,000 people (assuming, like me, an approximate $30k debt). Now, are you ready for this? I'm a single woman with a cat, and our food for a month runs about $250. The money spent on the 2012 Presidential campaign would pay for groceries for a month for EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE like me. How many people is that? It's the entire population of New York City. Why on earth are we spending this much???? Well, the answer is…..…..we don't learn about the ins and outs of our government anymore, and I have the PERFECT example of this. When I was in tenth grade, my US Government teacher had us all take the US Citizenship test, and he graded it to the same standard it's graded in real life. Three people out of a class of 27 actually passed it: a boy helping his Cuban father study for the real test, a Chinese girl studying for the real test, and me. Why did I pass it? Because I was homeschooled for two years, and my mother made me read all of our founding documents, including selected parts of the Articles of Confederation (the precursor to the Constitution). Now you would think this would demonstrate “ah, yes, we aren’t teaching our kids important stuff about the foundation of our government,” right? NO—my teacher said it only went to show how irrelevant the stuff on the test is. And he’s right about some of it (quick, Quorans from countries that aren’t the US: can you name the author of your national anthem?), but really? The bits off the actual Constitution are “irrelevant”????We never did read the Constitution in that class. Or any other. And there’s some important shit in there! For example—did you know that in the United States slavery actually isn’t illegal, and is allowed for by the Constitution in an amendment that has never been repealed? It’s true. The 13th Amendment says slavery is illegal except as punishment for a crime. Now, stop and consider some of what goes on in our prisons, and how disproportionately the school-to-prison pipeline affects black boys . . . hmm. Interesting. Or how about this? You know the whole argument about how we “can’t” move Election Day to a weekend to make it easier for people to vote? That’s a straight-up lie. Article II of the United States Constitution explicitly says Congress can vote on the day elections take place. It’s not that they “can’t”—it’s that they choose not to. Why aren’t we beating down our legislators’ doors with this? Because a lot of people don’t know it’s there!Or how about this gem, also from Article II: “The President shall, at stated Times, receive for his Services, a Compensation, which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the Period for which he shall have been elected, and he shall not receive within that Period any other Emolument from the United States, or any of them.”Translation into modernese: “The President’s salary must stay the same the whole time he’s in office, and he can’t receive any other payment from the government, whether it’s federal or state government, while in office.” Donald Trump is charging the Secret Service to rent space in Trump Tower for the protection of his family. That’s “any other payment,” from the federal government! But do people care? I mean, they’re pissed, but do they know that’s actually cause for impeachment? I bet not. Because most people’s knowledge of the Constitution begins and ends at the Preamble and the fact that the Bill of Rights exists—and most of them can’t name more than three of those ten amendments.So how does this play back into #1? Because, well, I’ll let one of my favorite Broadway songs do the talking for me, because it says it so well:“Give ’em the old flim-flam flummox/fool and fracture ‘em/how can they hear the truth above the roar?/Throw ’em a fake and a finagle/they’ll never know you’re just a bagel/razzle-dazzle ‘em, and they’ll beg you for more.”It doesn’t matter if you’re qualified to hold a major office, whether or not your voting record matches up with your promise, absolutely nothing matters except “be loud.” And then, once you’re in, fuck whoever put you there—because it costs so much to get in office in the first place, pretty much nobody will ever be able to unseat you.But we have a free vote, right?",750,32,652,372,0,0

That's not just my opinion, that's what the politicians are telling me privately. The ultimate cause is voter apathy and ignorance. Listen, the US would be better off ditching elections entirely and directly selling the congress seats or filling them with draftees who are more insulated from legal big money coercion and pressure. While I think a voter based republic is the best form of government, I argue this to show how broken our system is because such a change would actually make our system better and that is super sad. That is based on my experience with appointed federal judges who worked for adverse parties their entire careers but who are wonderfully fair and competent for my bankrupt clients even against the banks. I have never gotten that feeling about more than 2% of politicians. The mechanism of defeat on our system is the big money donor short circuit of policy and planning. No policy and no theory and no human logic matters when the result is merely bought. It doesn't even help the donor class as much as they would like because companies find that the towering inefficiencies gimp them in many ways-just witness the recent Reuters story that indicated that companies are beginning to take radical actions to reduce healthcare costs but are only able to achieve fractions of reductions on the world's least efficient and most deliberately expensive system. We have a dozen more major systems like it. The entire government must be remade, it cannot succeed in the long-term without massive changes.Our constitution was inadequate by the early 20th century, and was irrevocably broken by campaign finance power since the 1970s. Time has marched on past this type of system. In other words, if citizens don't engage with hyperactive vigilance to stamp out the role of big money campaign finance using any tool available-which will require a massive retool of the entire political and rights systems, or they will have to fight a bloody revolution to return to sane government. Every time smaller and smaller and less and less accountable elites are allowed to run a nation, that nation fails relative to functional republics and even can be beaten silly by an inefficient and brutal oligarchy like China. Unacceptable. Both parties must be threatened using loss of congress seats to effect a thorough purge of the bought platforms and separate the donors from the candidates. There is no imaginable universe where our present major parties can make the US an adequately functional republic while held at the financial equivalent of gunpoint by narrow lobby powers. That hope is as realistic as expecting gas station attendants to ignore having guns pointed at their heads during robberies and just go about their business. And be invulnerable to bullets. Really?We don't necessarily need to have voter control over everything, but nothing good overall can be accomplished that is worth the price with the US system of gimping congress and allowing the coercion that happens which keeps them largely unable to use any aspect of their independent judgment on policies. People actually think that is good and say that will keep the congress from intruding on their rights or otherwise making up mischief. Hunh? Hey, you don't get to say your government system is good or even adequate anymore when the people making the decisions are forbidden to do anything but sell the decisions for re-election money and party advancement.

Policians and government Leaders and officials are insufficiently called to account for themselves and their actions!Therefore — I think that an institutional mechanism for questions and answers should be instituted, both within Congress, but also, especially, between the Congress and the Executive.The natural and logical example here is what is called, in the Westminster style of government, “Question Period” — the Government, Ministers, and even bureaucrats through Committees, are made to publically answer questions from the People’s representatives.It is difficult to overstate the subtle, but profound, pressure and implications this institutional mechanism puts on governing elites — they have to know what’s going on; how things work; explain themselves and their actions; respond to public pressure; have their actions scrutinized, etc, etc. Knowing that you could be called to account is a profound knowledge, and power.….. Imagine a situation whereby the President of the United States had to go to Congress, say once a month, for say 3 hours, and publically answer questions from the Members! Imagine further, that the Congressional Leadership was likewise questioned in a similar fashion!There’s so much ‘smoke and mirrors’ in American politics because the players involved are never really compelled to answer questions on a regular basis.Instead, there’s reporters shouting questions above the whirl of the helicopter blades, and the President doing official Press conferences whenever he wants (ie seldomly), and most media events being extremely ‘managed’ about who even gets into the room, and who gets to ask questions, and controlled/planted questions, and reporters living in fear of having their media credentials revoked.The President, and his Cabinet Secretaries, and senior bureaucrats, and the Congressional Leaders wield huge powers within the government —- They should be made to answer to the People’s Representatives for the decisions they make, and the views they hold.And what is more is: that there is nothing ‘unconstitutional’ or abnormal about my proposed changes … all it would require is the establishment of an institutional mechanism to have regularized questions. The Constitution indirectly implies that the President shall communicate with the Congress — the President should be ‘invited’ to do so!Further, the ‘immunities clause for Congressional speech’ (Art. 1, Sec. 6) (“… for any Speech or Debate in either House, they [Members] shall not be questioned in any other Place.”) gives Members Constitutional protection for their Congressional speech — but, for my taste, it also directly implies that they WILL be questioned for their Congressional speech by their fellow members in the Congress —- So you want to be the Speaker of the House, or the Senate Majority Leader, etc, etc … I think you should be answering the other Members questions, on the floor of the Congress, at length, regularly.Ditto bureaucrats! They are public servants; they are paid by the public's monies, and supposedly serve the public interest —- they need to be hauled out into the open, and made to explain themselves, and their department’s actions, and policies, under Oath if needed, as often as the Congress requires. (All this bureaucrats ‘lawyering up’, and ‘avoiding appearing’, and ‘stonewalling questions’, and ‘claiming privilege’, or ‘hiding behind secrecy laws’, etc, etc is an absolute disgrace! When the public’s servants fight having to answer to the public’s elected representatives you know your democracy is imperiled!Want to change American government for the better?

That takes a bigger, more complex government, which requires higher rates of taxation, and this is also a legitimate claim.So, it’s bigger government and higher taxes vs. smaller government and lower taxes. Which works best? Obviously, that depends on where you live. Both sides have valid points. But here’s the key point: If you live in a big city, you will need a farmer to grow your wheat, or a dairy farmer to provide your milk and cheese, and if you live in the country, you will need people working in a city factory to build your truck, or you might need a heart specialist at a city hospital to put in your stents.In short, there are two Americas, one urban, one rural, which are intertwined and depend on one another.

He had a 76% approval rating among Republicans going into the Senate Watergate hearings, and maintained an above 50% approval rating with them well into 1974. It wasn’t until after Nixon released transcripts of his Oval Office conversations that his approval rating among Republicans started to swing within a few points of 50%.The other thing to keep in mind is that there aren’t very many moderates left in Congress on either side of the partisan divide[3], just as there are fewer moderates in the electorate[4].Above: Members of the House and Senate, respectively, plotted by their DW-NOMINATE scores for the 115th Congress.

Among “moderate conservatives,” it’s swung between 60 and 70%, but have recently come off their lows to be at the higher end of that range.So until Trump does something so egregious that it breaks through partisan media bubbles[7][8] and is recognized by Republicans generally as criminal misconduct, or unless he starts actively working against Republicans’ core legislative agenda[9], which so far has not manifested, there’s no reason to expect Republicans’ support to soften.Related reading: Carter Moore's answer to Trump's job approval rating is now 35%.

On this issue they’re wrong if they tell you there isn’t a stronger anti-American mentality on the left generally speaking, and leftist are more commonly within the Democratic party, the Dems have taken a sharp turn recently.Some of the members here are trying to make this about policy, or saying that the definition of patriotism is subjective. While those things are worth a mention, let’s be realistic here, the Democrats are doing things that Republicans aren’t. One of the most important factors to whether or not a person is a patriot is whether or not they’re proud of their country and the left is proud of this country FAR less often. How do I know this?Nobody should have blind patriotism but leftist take things to such an extreme, they more commonly do things like burn the American flag, kneel during the National Anthem, voice outright hate for our country, and violently protest when an election doesn’t go their way. That’s hard not to see so I’m surprised at some of the answers here.I’ve spoken with leftist who have tried to equate soldiers (who aren’t committing war crimes) with terrorist, suggested that our nation is founded in racism when it’s more complicated than that, it was founded on a lot of things including ingenuity, compassion, and cooperation.

1,Are Republicans more patriotic than Democrats?,Political Liberalism Vs. Political Conservatism,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Some Republicans definitely believe that they are more patriotic than Democrats. As to whether they are, that depends on how one defines patriotism. Conservatives claim to value liberty, but for some of them liberty means the right to choose to conform to their standards. For other conservatives, liberty means the right not to conform if that’s your choice. The GOP includes both attitudes.The debate over whether NFL players ought to be obliged to stand for the anthem is a snapshot of the issue. For a segment of the GOP, outward displays of patriotism matter a very great deal. It’s never okay to this group of Republicans for other Americans to show their dissent in ways that make this group of Republicans unhappy. For them, freedom of expression is subordinate to loyalty to the nation. Another group of Republicans see protest as a fundamental part of good citizenship. Authoritarian regimes demand full participation in ritual displays of patriotism, and the Republicans who value protest want no part of coerced patriotism.So whether Republicans are more patriotic or not depends on how your values are prioritized.

Now, the opposite is becoming true. I’m a law-and-order, by-the-book conservative, not a tear-down-society-and-overthrow-the-government “conservative.” I’m conservative about being conservative. Remember how Richard Nixon created the EPA, signed the Endangered Species Act and signed the Family Planning Act (Title X - Wikipedia)? Yeah, most people don’t remember that either, but I’m glad he did. And check out the Republican Party Platform of 1956. Awesomeness.Once Tea Party nutcases started taking control of the GOP in the early aughts, it was downhill from there. For a while, the GOP was increasingly under the control of ideologues dedicated to tearing down traditional institutions (public education, the Constitutional right to an abortion, the social safety net. etc.). But the Tea Party turned a lot of people off - people just wanted to hate and be bigoted and the Tea Party gave them that - but the Tea Party also wanted them to listen to an hour lecture about obscure Constitutional theory.Then Trump came along and let people have all the hate with none of the egghead homework. He goes straight to the dessert without the vegetables, so to speak, and people love it. Even though Trump was a lifelong Democrat and donated to the Clinton Foundation, all was forgiven. Many Tea Partiers opposed Trump, because he took advantage of many of the big-government programs the Tea Party opposes and he lacks the ideological and intellectual foundation of the Tea Party. Hell, Trump lacks any ideological or intellectual foundation.Mainstream Republicans are becoming fewer in number, as ideologues and nihilists take over the party.

2,Why do Republican Judges give Blacks harsher sentences than other races?,Sentencing (law),Judges,Judgment,Black People,1!,1!,"You have to be very careful with questions like this. Most people seize on studies that support their views and emphasize the shortcomings of studies that undercut them (or ignore those studies). Questions of this sort involving race and justice are very complex. Studies like the one cited by the article you cite help guide us to a better understanding, but only if you consider the data and analysis and put it in context of other things we know.Let’s start by being precise about the main finding of the study—federal judges give black defendants somewhat longer sentences than white defendants with similar characteristics on paper, and the disparity is greater for judges appointed by Republican presidents than judges appointed by Democratic presidents. There are many other findings of interest, but let’s limit ourselves to that.One simple explanation is that all judges are racist, and Republican judges are more racist than Democratic judges. But then you might expect the difference to be found for all crimes—when in fact it is mainly in crimes involving drugs or violence. Another detail hard to reconcile with this finding is that when judges are given more discretion the disparity increases—but because Democratic judges use the discretion to give lighter sentences to white criminals, not because Republican judges give harsher sentences to black criminals. This suggests Republican judges are going by the book, because they don’t change much when given more discretion, while Democratic judges use as much discretion as they have to be lenient to white criminals but not black.We know that most criminals share the race of their victims, so it could be that judges are more severe on criminals with black victims (the authors have no data on victim). That seems less plausible than the racist hypothesis given what we know about society, but how about this? Police identify the criminal much less often if the victim is black than if the victim is white. If 60% of white murderers are apprehended versus 30% of black murderers, it could be that the black murderers commit more egregious versions of the same crime. On paper they’re both murderers with the same criminal background, but we’re looking at the worst 60% of white murderers versus the worst 30% of black murderers.I’m not seriously arguing that these sorts of things explain the data, merely pointing out that there are a lot of possible explanations, given that the authors’ data omits a lot of variables that might be important. While it’s clear there’s a lot of racism in society, it’s hard to pin down what’s cause and what’s effect. Is the racism in police devoting less effort to black victims than white victims? Is it in the educational system that serves blacks less well than whites? Is it in economic discrimination that causes blacks with higher ability to choose crime over legal work? Is it some more complex dynamic?Next we get to the data. The authors used two huge databases, and had to throw out half the data because it didn’t match. They did some credible work to defend the idea that the resulting data was reasonably representative of the total, but that’s still very troublesome to a statistician. On top of that, we know large databases of this type are filled with errors, as is the matching process (one gigantic issue is that race is defined socially, not by any objective characteristic).The authors mention dozens of variables in complex specifications, and only report significance levels as if they did one test. The findings are not so significant that they couldn’t be explained by trying thousands of models and picking the ones that the authors liked. I’m not accusing them of doing that, but it is very difficult to avoid the tendency of data mining in studies like this, and the authors make no adjustment for it.The last complexity I will mention is that the authors only ask whether of two criminals who look similar on paper, the black criminal receives the longer sentence. They fail to ask whether of two criminals who receive the same sentence, the black criminal’s offense looks less serious on paper. If racism is the explanation, both those things should be true. But in these kinds of studies, it’s more common that only one is true.For example, at the same level of education, blacks earn less than whites. But at the same level of income blacks are less educated than whites. So who is being discriminated against?In this case, my guess (just a 60% guess, I haven’t checked the data) is that black criminals with the same sentence have more severe offenses on paper than white criminals. The fact that the authors don’t bother to report this obvious and essential check makes me suspicious of either their reasons for publishing or their statistical sophistication.I don’t mean these questions to undermine the apparent simple explanation of the results. The authors did gather a lot of data, and subjected it to sophisticated statistical analysis. They did look at a lot of competing explanations. The paper is nothing like conclusive proof that Republicans are more racist than Democrats, but it should make any non-racist Republican look hard at procedures for federal judge selection (and any non-racist Democrat as well, although their problem is quantitatively smaller).",1.1k,29,5k,"5,788",0,0
2,Why do Republican Judges give Blacks harsher sentences than other races?,Sentencing (law),Judges,Judgment,Black People,1!,1!,"You have a white man and a black man standing before the same Judge. Both of them have committed the same crime, have the same criminal background, and have the same level of legal representation. If THAT judge gives the white man a lesser sentence THEN you can start making it a racial issue.If you ever have the above situation happen then it is much more rare than is being claimed. People are quick to think with the wrong end of their body rather than use their head to ask the right questions. Did 1 of those individuals have priors? Did they resist arrest? Did they do anything to warrant the stronger sentence?These are questions to ask in all of these cases. Something that is very important to note here is that I stated “the same judge” because some of these misleading news articles leave out key details when preaching about these issues. One that is often forgot is location, location, location. There are a few counties here in Texas that will nail you on the tiniest amount of drugs and they will do it in a very hard way. A black man getting busted in those counties is most definitely going to have a much heavier sentence than in other places. The same is very true for white people.Another common misleading and divisive trick of the tabloids is to conveniently forget demographics. If I have a city with a very high black population and that unfortunately happens to be where there’s a very high crime rate then it’s only logical that you will find more of a police presence there. The higher the crime rate, the population of the people, and the greater the odds of having negative interactions with the police department. What many of these “publications” like to do is compare police interaction in lower crime areas to higher crime areas and give the idea that there is some kind of racial issue going on. That’s not logical and there are many black police officers who’ll likely swear they aren’t racist against black people. Demographics are important for understanding how these ‘statistics” are strung together.Entities, like the WashingtonJoke, expect people to maintain a linear thread in how they process data. They do not want their readers focusing on any other variables within these issues because those variables destroy their position… which if you haven’t figured it out yet, is not news.",157,8,392,824,0,0
2,Why do Republican Judges give Blacks harsher sentences than other races?,Sentencing (law),Judges,Judgment,Black People,1!,1!,"Q: Why do Republican Judges give Blacks harsher sentences than other races?A: The article you provided a link to provides an analysis on this question, though in its effort to not come across as partisan, it fails to just come right out and explicitly say the obvious - that the sentencing disparities reflect a degree of racial bias on the part of the judges themselves.And it should be noted that the study discussed in your link found that Democratic judges (or, more accurately, judges appointed by Democrats) also give blacks harsher sentences than other races - but not to quite the same degree as judges appointed by Republicans.It should come as no surprise to anyone that Republican politicians making judicial appointments tend to appoint more conservative judges than Democratic politicians making judicial appointments. And it should also be rather obvious to anyone who has been paying attention that political conservatism tends to be more closely aligned with racial bias than political liberalism.Odds are, the vast majority of the judges revealed by the study to demonstrate racial bias in their sentencing track records do not see themselves as racist. The results uncovered by the study probably reveal implicit, unconscious racial bias much more than overt racism.Combating implicit racial bias, which almost of us carry with us to some degree, is very difficult. Studies have shown that in implicit racial bias tests, even black people show unconscious bias towards other black people. It’s a product of growing up in a culture where racist messages are rampant. Our movies, our television shows, our music, our video games, all have a tendency to over-represent black people as criminals, thugs, addicts and derelicts, and to under-represent them as educated, intelligent, honest, gainfully employed law abiding citizens making valuable contributions to our society.

Thus when Michael Brown, unarmed and hands raised, was killed by a cop in Ferguson, Mo., in 2014, the press rushed to assure us that he was “no angel” and accused him of having shoplifted something from a convenience store, something which the cop who killed him could not have known and as if the appropriate penalty for an accusation of shoplifting was summary execution in the Street.

There are very few republican judges since Chicago, Cook County, Illinois is dominated by the democrats. Judges are elected in Illinois.At sentencing, all judges must take into consideration the facts of the case, the criminal history of the defendant, whether a gun was used, the defendant’s social background, his education level and the heinousness of the crime. This is mandated by the sentencing laws. Each crime is classified into a class. Class 4 felonies receive the least harsh punishments. The punishment gets progressively harsher as the classes progress to class 1 felonies. Then there’s the class x felonies such as armed robbery, many drug crimes and attempt murder, to name a few. Those felonies carry a sentence of 6 to 30 years and the defendant is not eligible for probation. Last, but not least is Murder. That carries a sentence of 20 to life without parole. All sentences can be enhanced to double the highest number of years if the defendant has an extensive criminal history. For instance, a class x offender with an extensive criminal history could be sentenced anywhere from 6 to 60, instead of 30.All sentences must be a determinate number. A judge cannot give a spread, such as 3 to 5 years. The sentence must be a single number within the parameters set out in the sentencing statute. So, the sentence would be either 3, 4 or 5 of the example I used.If a gun is used in a crime, the sentence is enhanced by 15 years. So, in an armed robbery, for instance, the defendant could get 10 years for the armed robbery and an additional 15 years for the use of a gun, for a sentence of 25 years.There’s a lot that goes into a sentencing. Judges are constrained to the parameters set forth in the sentencing statute. Any sentence outside those parameters would be considered illegal, and reversed by the appellate court for re-sentencing.The last thing I’ll mention about sentencing is that no 2 cases are the same. Every case has different facts. Those facts are what determine the harshness of the penalty.",26,1,67,754,0,0

A country made by intellectuals and rebels who founded America based on individual rights and the idea that government exists only to protect those rights of equality, of life, of liberty, and the right to pursue happiness.Since then there has been a complete war on liberalism… And if you look at the McCarthy hearings, the witchhunt of Clinton, and the current climate in America of anti-liberalism, it becomes shocking how we have become a culture of intolerance, hatred, and hostile to freedom, individual fart, independent thinking… And return to a level of fundamentalism that could only be embraced by the farthest right wing of a fascist world. .The Christian religion in America has become the party of hatred and intolerance… Cheering on capital punishment, gun possession, intolerance and even hatred for gays and lesbians, destroying the rights of women… The most unchristian people I have ever seen in my life.

Laborers would have the right of arbitration, and the right to safe working conditions, collective bargaining, and non-arbitration – the right to sue when their civil rights and human rights are being abused.Healthcare would be considered a civil right, and all people would have access to healthcare the way they have it in so many of the civilized countries of the world.Focus and emphasis will be put on education for everyone, to allow for social mobility and for people to be able to pursue their rights given by God.Compassion would be a part of our national policy, in order to help people who are disadvantaged to live up to their potential. Yes… Maybe there would be food stamps and housing and job training to help people who are disadvantaged to achieve the American dream.Money might be put towards education and infrastructure it is now being used to prop up The US military.

It is true that they want government small enough to fit into a vagina but otherwise, no.When Republicans say they advocate “liberty” and “less government regulation,” what they really mean is giving Wall Street and corporate “persons” the liberty to mercilessly exploit consumers, employees and the environment, while at the same time keeping actual persons on a very short leash. They want government out of corporate board rooms but have no problem with regulating what people do in their bedrooms. They intrude on peoples’ private business and use the law to enforce their own religious and/or moral standards.And while the GOP prides itself on being a champion of the “free market,” in fact Republican policies promote crony capitalism, tilting the already unlevel playing field in favor of big corporations and discouraging competition by small businesses and entrepreneurs.As a left-libertarian, when I say I want smaller government, I am referring to keeping the state out of peoples’ private lives.

Every Republican since then has expanded the federal debt, often dramatically. 4 of the top 5 highest additions to the federal debt came under Republican Presidents. Some of the biggest expansions, under Reagan, W. Bush and Trump, have happened when the Republicans controlled Congress too.Republicans claim to oppose regulation, but they support pro-business regulation just fine. They've shown little interest in rolling back regulations that prevent interstate competition in health insurance, that restrict entry in banking, that limit the ways doctors and lawyers can structure their businesses. Some of the regulation they've rolled back is the kind of pro-market regulation libertarians actually like.Republicans have been strong supporters of gun rights. I'll give them that.They liked federalism and states rights right up until they were in charge.They used to support rule of law, but when Bush couldn't get his way with a Democratic Congress, they stripped out most of the limitations on the executive branch. Unsurprisingly this has been expanded further by Obama and Trump. At the same time vague and hastily written laws like the Dodd-Frank act have shifted even more power to the executive branch.Republicans also hold a number of positions that are opposed to libertarian values.

Why don't prominent Republicans criticize Trump?Thanks for the A2A, Jenni.When Ronald Reagan (aka among conservatives as St. Ronald) was ascending, during his 1966 campaign for California Governor, he stated what came to be called the 11th Commandment: “Thou shalt not speak ill of any fellow Republican.” For decades that proscription prevailed among Republicans.As nearly as I can tell, the AstroTurf growth of the Tea Party, starting in 2010, found a group of Republicans willing to ignore the commandment during primary elections, but it still holds sway generally.Probably another factor is that Republicans are afraid to offend trump supporters. (Keep in mind, there were enough of them to get trump elected, and they can be a vocal bunch—much like the Tea Partiers.) Those officeholders don’t want to fight a bloody primary fight.A few of the R’s leaving Congress, such as Jeff Flake, have been critical of trump and where they see the current Republican party. But the overall tendency seems to be to just keep quiet going out the door.",55,2,77,"1,809",0,0
1,Democrats were often quite critical of Obama. Why don't prominent Republicans criticize Trump?,Democratic Party (US politics),Barack Obama (politician),1!,1!,1!,1!,"Despite all of the scandals, missteps, and outright lies that have emanated from President Trump since Day One, he has never lost his “base” of around 35%. Assuming that the GOP gets about 1/2 of the overall vote, and that his base votes overwhelmingly Republican, it is clear that his base, while not a majority for the country as a whole, certainly constitutes a majority (or close to one) within the Republican Party.Also, his base is fanatically loyal to him. They will wait for hours to watch him pass by, sit through his interminable rallies, wave signs and, well, actually go to trouble of voting. When he boasted that he could shoot a man in the middle of 5th. Avenue and not lose any votes, it wasn’t that much of an exaggeration. Finally, for a multitude of reasons, Fox News is in the tank for him, which is what his base relies upon to get their alternative facts. So any criticism of him that actually gets through to his base is watered down and usually dismissed outright as “fake news”.As a result, Trump has a great deal of control within the GOP. Moderate Republicans are now under threat of losing GOP primary races to candidates that mirror Trump’s message, antics, or both. And even those who aren’t being challenged within their party must be careful not to upset Trump’s base, lest those Republicans stay at home on Election Day. So these “moderates” have to walk a tightrope - throw just enough red meat to keep Trump’s base happy without crossing the line and alienating non-Trump Republicans and/or incensing Democrats so much that they become super-engaged.For a Republican member of Congress, criticizing Trump is close to political suicide, which is why the vast majority of Republicans who have done so are ones who are on their way out already.Also, with Trump, the GOP have their majority. Which means that they get to pass the legislation they want, like their massive tax breaks for the wealthy constituents that paid to get them in office in the first place. So dealing with Trump for them is like eating your vegetables when you were a kid. If you don’t do it, you won’t get desert.",43,2,13,134,0,0

3,"Are Republicans less humorous than Democrats, or are audiences just less tolerant of opposing views?",Democratic Party vs. Republican Party,1!,1!,1!,1!,1!,"Tolerance of differing views is becoming a lost facet of American Society.I blame the internet since it allows people to bypass the people around them to seek out affirmative positions online.The Republicans are just as guilty as the Democrats and to a degree are worse. Moderate Republicans, in elected office, are getting scarce while moderate Democrats can still get elected.The Democrats are funnier but only sort of. The liberal comedians are funnier but only a few are vocally Democrats.The funniest guy on Capitol Hill though is probably Lindsay Graham and he’s super Conservative.Satire has become a liberal weapon but once, Rush Limbaugh was actually good at satire but his time in the echo chamber morphed that skill into meanness.The difference that matters is the lingering effect of Jon Stewart who was actually more effective at lambasting liberals than conservatives. His influence is quite strong right now with all of his disciples having matured into very public vehicles of their own. Each still almost relishes the opportunity to blister the liberal elite between harpooning the low hanging fruit that modern Conservatism occasionally provides.The heavily targeted audiences is very much a part of the problem. Demography in modern media has become heavily compartmentalized but this is really the result of the huge array of options struggling to achieve any audience at all.Alex Jones was always considered a kook but he has millions of listeners/viewers, he has a platform and it’s because he plays fast and loose with facts and was largely disregarded for years.Tomi Lahren is actually a good example. She’s young, white and Privaledgeed and is famous for her angry rants online. She has no conventional media platform but reaches millions. Millions of self selected people who like her angry rants, even when they are full of holes ideologically. She is seldom actually challenged, which is the point.Jon Stewart though liked the challenge and his willingness to accept that made him better but also attracted the most competent voices from the other side.Today’s voices don’t like the exchange of ideas and they don’t like the challenge. This is bad because it dumbs everything down.Ben Shapiro is a smart guy but his interactive skill set is tailored to end a discussion and then pronounce a victory, even though he has not moved the other person one centimeter.This happens on the Left because they have adopted the successful mechanisms of the Right.We saw this before with the Clintons who were exceptional at using Republican Campaign Tactics and organizational structures to enforce doctrine. This had a deleterious effect on the Democratic Party.That said, telling jokes is cathartic. Within reason.When Larry “the Cable Guy” told a joke that amounted to building a city full of Democrats under sea level in the path of a Cat 5 hurricane was sound planning it kinda fell flat. You don’t even hear Bill Maher argue that school shootings in Republican districts (which seems to be where they happen) are good strategic planning.Sheer meaness isn’t funny.Humor is a good way of taking the edge off of a difficult subject. It’s also a convenient way to not zone out on drawn out aggravating subjects, like Donald Trump saying that NFL anthem protestors shouldn’t be in America. Even though he has been shooting his mouth off for decades and is frequently dead wrong and hasn’t been escorted out of the country, yet.Humor is rooted most often in common sense and satire is rooted in hypocrisy. It’s hard to be funny if you have little of the former and lots of the latter. Both ends of the political spectrum have suffered a dirth of common sense and often revel in their own hypocrisy.",84,1,275,"1,377",0,0

On this list above you have people of different races, different nationalities, different sexes, different sexualities, and different beliefs, including atheists. However, that is all surface stuff, and not really important in political matters. The key information is that all these people share different views on a variety of topics, including core conservative issues such as abortion, gay marriage, fiscal spending, 2nd Amendment rights and immigration. You don’t see this diversity of opinion in today’s Democratic Party. Oh sure some of them disagree on certain minor issues, but very few go against the main line of thinking regarding guns, immigration, welfare and identify politics.If you want to know what the Democrat Party stands for, you really only have to hear one of their leaders, or listen to one speaker at their convention. Classical liberals, such as Dave Rubin, Sam Harris, Bill Mahr, etc., have all been chastised and figuratively or literally kicked out of the Democrat Party for the unforgivable sin of disagreeing with, or even questioning, a certain issue or 2. The Democrat Party is now a combination of Progressivism and Leftism(which basically means an intolerant, radical version of the left that specializes in race-baiting and unwarranted character attacks perfectly described by Antifa, academia, modern feminism, Black Lives Matter, and politicians like Maxine Watters and Nancy Pelosi).These people are obsessed with race, gender and political correctness. People who don’t “toe the line” are booted or quietly phased out.Don’t believe me that the Democratic Party is this far left? Look at the midterm primaries just completed.

Most of them I've witnessed or been part of end with the Democrat throwing insults and ending the conversation because their level iof understanding the arguments being made by the other side have gone being their ability to dig further.The republicans I talk to have some hard stances on what constitutes ethical behavior, but they will take rather deep dives into the nature of LGBT issues and religious freedom if you have an opening conversation with them - for instance, why both sides of the “gay cake Baker” court case have meetings with talking about, etc… I can talk with most of them for hours about a subject, but it's certainly less of an angry pointing of fingers than when a Democrat is part of the discussion.If you want to talk about sense of humor, they're generally far less scared and angry than the Democrats.

Of course the fun part is that he gets policies, legislation or foreign policy victories under their noses, because their attention is on mundane humorous comments.I remember the jokes on a Family TV show about 15 years ago was a father sitting down to dinner and getting the kids explaining how everything on the table was “offensive” to them to eat, or every “chore” was a blight on society.

He's a compulsive liar; he lies even when the lie is really really obvious and makes him worse off; he lies even when the truth is actually to his advantage. He lies from habit. He can't stop.And lying to the FBI is a criminal offence.The protections that keep the FBI, and other executive and judicial systems, politically neutral were put in after Watergate and Hoover. They are new. They are vulnerable. (It's not like the bill of rights, where nothing is likely to undermine it.)Trump understands that the Republicans will help him undermine the rule of law and the safeguards against political manipulation of the system, because they're scared of losing Trump voters. Nunes, for example, told flat out lies in the Nunes memo to help Trump undermine the FBI.Trump understands that the oversight committees will not do their jobs as long as the Republicans have majorities on them. (And some Democrats. His nomination of a self-confessed torturer and criminal to lead the CIA won with the support of several key Democrats.)He understands that the systems which make sure the President obeys the law are weak, vulnerable, and can be ignored if he can just create enough political fog.So yes, it's an act of classical despotism. He's making the judicial system choose political sides instead of staying neutral. He's launching political attacks against even other Republicans if they don't swear loyalty personally to the Glorious Leader Trump. He's using the judicial system for political attacks on his predecessor and opponent - the exact crime he falsely accuses Obama of. (Projection. He misuses the office of the President for personal and political gain on a daily basis; he literally can't imagine people like Obama who did the job honestly. He would misuse the police to arrest all his opponents if he dared; he can't imagine that someone else would never behave the same way.)He's trying to sabotage the rule of law in the US, before it catches up with him.It's up to Americans whether this works.

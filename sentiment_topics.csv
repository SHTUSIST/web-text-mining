1,"I am both optimistic and pessimistic.China is striving to become the world’s largest economy with initiatives like the One Belt One Road initiative and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. The reason for China doing this is because it has excess production capacity, and because many developing economies are weak in infrastructure development. On the surface, this looks like a good match.So where is the problem?The problem is that China is too rushed in making these plans come to fruition. There is a trick to infrastructure projects: Building infrastructure is good, but markets have to develop in-step with the new demand the infrastructure is supposed to support.If the markets take too long to develop, then the cost of the debt rises, and after a while, it becomes impossible to grow out of the debt trap. This leads to a Balance sheet recession - Wikipedia.The perfect example of a long-term balance sheet recession is Japan, which has excellent and very modern infrastructure, but whose domestic economy does not have sufficient demand to grow out of the recession.Balance sheet recessions are very insidious because they lead to:Lower birth rates, with birth rates often falling to below replacement levels;Political instability (just look at all the governments Japan has gone through in the past 30 years);Lost generations of workers.My fear about the Trump administration’s policies is that they will not help American workers, but they will slow global growth to such an extent that the global economy will slow, and then stagnate.This is very dangerous for China, because China is trying to build markets which will create more demand.There is a problem here: the Chinese government is good at building production capacity, but it has not been good at predicting and creating demand.This means that some countries which take out loans from China hoping for future growth will fail to meet their expectations, and will be tipped over into balance-sheet recessions with China being the main loanholder.This will not be good for China or anyone else.I believe that this is the main strategy behind Peter Navarro, Robert Lighthizer and US Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross. They want to slow global growth and trade to the point where the countries which are closest to China will be forced into long-term balance sheet recessions, and will blame China for their heavy debt loads.They are laying a trap, and current Chinese policy is walking right into it.",197,0.09194064707222602,0.41702437912964235,0.9961278794145636

5,"I think that China's GDP has actually exceeded that of the United States. it is not a joke . let's take a look at a few linked tables first:http://www.360doc.cn/article/642...China has used 10 times or 8 times of cement, steel, plastic, aluminum, stainless steel and other building materials than the United States, and has built many times of houses, roads, railways and bridges than the United States.But the GDP of the construction industry in the United States is slightly higher than that in China.China completed 1 billion square meters of housing in 2017, and the United States about 200 million square meters, Chinese houses are expensive, but the GDP of real estate in the United States is several times that of China.China's hotels, accommodation, catering business area, turnover and so on are many times as many as those of the United States. however, it should be no problem to have far more than that, but its GDP is nearly twice as large as that of China.China's cargo transportation per ton, personnel transportation per kilometer, warehouse turnover, and post delivery are many times larger than those in the United States. however, my observation in China and the United States is also much larger. looking at the ranking of world port throughput , we can also roughly observe it, but the GDP of this industry in the United States is still slightly larger than that in China.Under the premise that the statistics of China's total retail sales are far from complete, they are already at the same level as those of the United States in 2017. they are definitely surpassed this year, but the GDP of USA retail sales is twice as high as that of China.In fact, all aspects of China have already or almost immediately surpassed the United States, or have far left the United States:The sales volume of cars in China is 28 millions and is 17 millions in the United States,Dont think the cars in China is all cheap cars, the sells of luxury cars in China, such as Benz,BMW,AUDI, is also far higher than that in the United States.China's total social retail sales in 2017 was equal to that of the United States. this statistic is far from adequate for small store sales and 2018 will surpassed that of the United States.The total box office of movie in China is close to in the United States, surpassing it in the United States and expected to reach soon.......Personally, China's GDP has surpassed that of the United States.So you know my answer:China's GDP is not overestimated but underestimated,USA's GDP is overestimated.",1,0.09673054587688734,0.4748432055749128,0.003842842695238365

34,"Thanks for your A2A.If you measure GDP in terms of Purchase Power Parity (PPP), China has already exceeded US by such measure in 2014. What is PPP?To understand PPP, let’s take a commonly used example, the price of a hamburger. If a hamburger is selling in China for RMB12 and in New York for US$4, this would imply a PPP exchange rate of 3 RMB to 1 U.S. dollars. This PPP exchange rate may well be different from that prevailing financial exchange rate between 2 countries which is often used for absolute comparison when converting to US$.PPP is a more balanced approach than exchange rate as “PPP exchange rates are relatively stable over time. By contrast, market rates are more volatile, and using them could produce quite large swings in aggregate measures of growth even when growth rates in individual countries are stable.” Both OECD and IMF use PPP. For details on PPP, see here.Besides GDP measured in terms of PPP, I would like to highlight some other areas that China has surpassed the U.S. :HSR InfrastructureChina has invested heavily in HSR infrastructure and it is beginning to bear fruit. If you want to promote consumption and investment in the hinterland of a big country like China, a well-developed HSR infrastructure would facilitate such factors of growth.For e.g., most Chinese from other provinces would avoid going to Guizhou province in the West hinterland to work because it is rather undeveloped and one of the poorest provinces in China. But with HSR constructed in Guizhou, then it makes it easy for people living in Central China to work there and return to their home town regularly on weekends to see their families. For e.g., the HSR ticket from Guiyang city of Guizhou to Changsa city of Hunan province costs as low as USD46.92. It is definitely not cheap for the average Chinese but it would be affordable for those working in multinationals as they are investing in Guizhou now, especially in the field of Big Data - see The Big Data Valley of China.Actually Trump has a plan to improve the infrastructure of U.S. but unfortunately it becomes a whimper without progress as his tax cuts have bloated the budget. An HSR infrastructure would help to boost domestic consumption and investment in the U.S. as rail costs are generally cheaper than air freight/travel and now with Foxconn slated to build a factory in Wisconsin, the HSR infrastructure looks more urgent than never. Do note that some HSR lines in China do carry freight.e-Services Apps/mobile e-paymentChina has implemented a good strategy to house all essential e-service applications under one roof on the mobile phone and the Chinese use it most of the time for transactions. You can access the e-government services, e-wallet, financial services, transport services etc. Such ease of usage would spur consumption as the general customer does not have cash with him that reminds him how much physical money he has.Below is the screen-capture of the first page of the basic functions of China’s popular WeChat Pay App. It has a ride-hailing app, rail/plane ticket app, e-government services etc in an integrated interface.I have written a post on Chinese mobile e-payment here :A look at the Chinese mobile e-payment by David BK Tan on China Boleh!Renewal Fuel Research and Plans to depend less on OilEven if you don’t believe in Peak Oil theory, that fact is that our global population is growing and the developing countries are growing their economies too so more and more oil are required. Coupled with the dismal oil price that means oil exploration is reduced compared to the heyday of US$100+ oil price, the price of oil would have to adjust upwards when its global supply runs low.As the biggest oil importer of the world, China is preparing for the “oil shock” by exploring renewal fuel technology. It has made a significant breakthrough last year with regard to combustible ice. Other areas that I am aware are bioethanol fuel, power cars with waste CO2 (see link), floating nuclear power plant etc.As for plans to depend less on oil, China has announced in 2017 a plan for nationwide use of bioethanol gasoline by 2020. It also wants to make electric car the mode of transport by 2050 and Bank of America Merrill Lynch estimated that electric car would account for 90 per cent of cars sold in China by 2050. https://www.scmp.com/business/gl...SupercomputerThough the U.S. beat China recently to claim the accolade of top supercomputer after languishing at the second/third spot since 2012, China tops the US as the number one supercomputer manufacturer according to MIT Technology Review.

For the US, military might mostly means the ability to bomb countries on the other side of the world.China has no need to bomb countries on the other side of the world. For China, the military emphasis is overwhelmingly on the defense. What this means in practice is that China invests to create military superiority in its own neighborhood.The advantage of focusing on your own neighborhood is cost. China does not have to invest in a major global logistic infrastructure to fight expeditionary wars. Most of the money can go to firepower, rather than supply. For example, the combat to supply personnel ratio for the US in Iraq was 1:3. It takes 3 units of resources to supply 1 unit of firepower to fight on the other side of the world.In practice what this means is that China can surpass American military power in its neighborhood with a much smaller military budget. Globally it will not be a match for the US military, but locally it can effectively outgun the US military by having greater concentration of forces and much shorter supply lines.",8,0.11394787644787645,0.3464671814671814,0.9913779473725408

She is trying to build a country founded on economic partnerships around the globe, not by conquest.This is not to deny her ambition to international stature as an economic powerhouse. Why should she not aim so? She has to provide economic security to a huge population while moving gradually from a command economy to a free-market system, or some thing between. This is a titanic challenge not to be met by brute military power.Sure, she will build a modern military capability but with one essential goal: to protect her sovereignty from foreign aggression. She will thereby become the dominant regional military power and one not to be ignored by the US.She has chosen to engage the rest of the world using the strategy of soft power to preserve her security. She is no less aggressive in flexing her economic muscles than the US who are still locked into the antiquated strategy of hard power through military force.The US, in contrast, is now retreating from the world within its brittle carapace, like a turtle that, fearing everything, withdraws into its shell.Here is a great example of asymmetric warfare. China engages the US on a field that renders American hard power impotent. How can the US counter China's economic aggression? How does one counter an economic strategy with missiles and bullets? History demonstrates that tariffs are self-defeating. They are very much a wooden club brought to a balletic knife-fight.I have been a soldier and serious student of military history my entire life.

44,"I don’t know how correct is this comparison, but anyway…I’d say that the original difference lies in the assigned role of the economy in the nation’s life.The Chinese leadership chose to use the power of the Party to transform China’s economy from the agrarian one of the Maoist era into an industrial powerhouse: but for this the Party has changed its politics to cater to the economy, changing to accomodate its own version of capitalism.And yet, the Party is still in control, because the Party commands the corps, and the corps must never be allowed to command the Party.But unlike China’s orderly transformation, Russia post-1991 was in free fall under the tender cares of the oligarchs and their Western friends. Impoverished & tired, the People allowed Putin to take control.And he chose to put the economy at the service of his onw policies: recovering stability, growth, military might and international stature.With China increasing its consumption and with the Middle East destabilized by the US, it was the time to use Russia’s vast and barely tapped natural resources to start growing again.But this growth hasn’t been married with competitiveness & exportations, as in China: if Russia produces planes, trucks and cars, who is buying them? In Africa, Asia and Latin America, which is easier to find: FAW or Kamaz? Changan or AvtoVAZ?These companies are sustained with oil money, but have little influence beyond creating jobs: they exists to keep people employed and in support of Putin. As long as this situation doesn’t change, there is little incentive for Russia to stop its dependence on oil and use its industrial muscle to compete internationally.::Comparing the Russian and Chinese economies, the Russian economy is heavily dependent on natural resource exports, while the Chinese economy is more dependent on value-added from Chinese citizens; why have these economies developed differently::",5,0.051923076923076926,0.3384615384615385,0.9946093441390473
45,"History is Russia’s worst enemy. For reasons that are obvious the Soviets after WWII concentrated too much on their military. The state owned industries were always backward and inefficient. In a world were consumer goods were a great avenue towards growth the Soviets didn’t produce anything wanted internationally. I am familiar with Soviet made cameras and their stuff was a generation behind, in part because they were using designs and equipment created in Germany and taken back to Russia. They had a native camera industry that was building 1938 style cameras in 1955. If you look at Soviet calculators you see the same backwardness.The difficulty in exporting to the US ended up hurting even East German camera, that were often quite good, though not on par with the best of Japan.Too many people relied on social services provided by their jobs and that ended up making modernization of Soviet products an afterthought.The Japanese improved because they saw the weaknesses in their autos when they tried to sell them in the US (they were under powered for US traffic). There wasn’t any feedback process in Russia and the Russian products were good enough and easy to fix. (Just look a how Cubans have maintained US cars imported before 1963 and you will understand how adversity makes people strong.)China had may of the same problem, such as a generation long set of wars and civil wars, but they didn’t have a huge set of industries with a large internal customer.So the dependence on energy is part of the problem, but the other is an industrial plant and industrial processes that were out of date. Like Japan, China was export driven and quickly learned what could or could not be sold.So, the huge internal market during the Soviet era, meant that industries didn’t modernize.",3,0.15221674876847294,0.39322660098522166,0.9939793619671836

Since ancient times, the Chinese economy was never one focused on natural resources but rather diversification into a plethora of products and services. China does not have much natural resources in any point in history, and always relied on technology breakthroughs to sustain its population. It is miraculous that the world's most populous nation is sustained on such small amount of arable land. But it was made possible by administrative innovation, irrigation innovation, and distribution innovation. China has always been an expert at playing the long game.Russia's history has been one of invasion after invasion: Vikings, Turks, Mongols, and Western Europeans. This creates a culture of Carpe Diem but not conducive to long term planning. Natural resources is low-hanging fruit, and Russia is blessed with lots of it… well, they fought hard to acquire it all. The Russian population is also tiny compared to its physical size, so a resource export economy makes the most sense, because exploiting the land at a sustainable rate does not require a lot of people, but a production and service economy requires more people and infrastructure, both of which are challenging to Russia for now and likely forever.",19,0.10291666666666668,0.4742261904761905,0.9912896517136294
47,"China was a settled agricultural civilization with several thousands years of written history, cultural continuity and managerial traditions beneath its belt.Russia was a colonization project of a small group of state/military aristocracy. The wealth of our civilization most of the time was dependent not on the labor of peasants toiling the land, or the skills of state managers organizing their work, but on expanding territories and pumping them for pelts, honey, wax, slaves, timber and mineral resources.Which is why the primary application the Chinese found for the modern technology has been manufacturing. While we predictably prefer to use it for export-oriented extractive industries, as well as for producing weapons and other means of defending the perimeter. The strategic advantage of the Chinese is their vast pool of hard-working, still relatively inexpensive workforce. Our strategic advantage is our vast expanses with an immense wealth hidden beneath them.

48,"I believe the answer to this lies in two different mindsets about how to best manage the economy of each country by its leaders.I suggest that the CCP has come to realize that the true wealth of China lies in the productivity of its people. And I would also suggest that they had a perfect laboratory to work with to come to that conclusion in the form of Hong Kong and Singapore who built thriving economies with virtually no natural resources except the productivity of their people. Perhaps the relatively high concentration of engineers and scientists within the CCP may explain this. But China chose to trust the ingenuity and productivity of its people to lead the way, with guidance from the CCP.Russia, and the former Soviet Union, has been primarily ruled by military men, former spies, etc., who don’t trust as much in their people because, if given enough incentive and opportunity, their people would likely rise up and demand their heads on a spike just as they did the Czars before them. Natural resources are far more easily controlled centrally and by a few key people that aren’t so likely to rebel.But future technology trends are not going to be kind to natural resource based economies. Eventually, to survive, Russia is going to have to become more like China and trust that its true wealth is in the productivity of its people just as the CCP has done. And that will mean it will have to start putting a lot more trust in its people than it currently does.And that is also a lesson that all resource rich countries need to learn going forward, whether currently rich, poor, or in between.True wealth and prosperity lies with your people, not your resources.",4,0.18690104166666663,0.5354947916666668,0.9945672111193611

50,"The “China model” started out with Deng Xiaoping’s “Cat doctrine” rejection of doctrinaire Communism - “it doesn’t matter if the cat is black or white, if it catches mice, it’s a good cat” - and started following the export-driven industrialization path established by Japan, South Korea, and especially the ethnic Chinese areas of Taiwan and Hong Kong, and - a bit later - Singapore. None of these areas has much of anything in natural resources, either because they’re physically very small, or are resource-poor volcanic rocks in the sea.Also, it helped greatly that the US and China were de facto allies against the Soviets for about the last decade and a half of the Cold War. So, the US welcomed Chinese imports, which encouraged Taiwanese and Hong Kong businessmen with capital to develop factories in places like Shenzhen and Xiamen to produce goods for export to the US and elsewhere.Singaporean expertise helped greatly to develop the area around Shanghai and (especially) Suzhou.Within a generation, mainland Chinese entrepreneurs who learned business and management skills in these environments built their own factories and business empires.As for natural resources, China has some, but with a vast population and its own large manufacturing base, it makes more economic and logistical sense to use them for domestic manufacturing, and other than a few things like Rare-earth minerals, there are few unusual resources in China.Russia for reasons I’ve never quite understood, never did try anything like the “Japan route”- even after the end of Communism - and its economy looks more like a Middle Eastern country (old joke: Russia is Saudi Arabia with nukes) than anything else.

56,"Thanks for the A2A.State-controlled capitalism is a misnomer to me because if you look at Xi’s plan, he wants both privately-owned enterprises (POEs) and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to help China to develop an external wing of its economy (called 走出去 in Mandarin) as Chinese economy is slowing down because the global economy is slowing down. The emphasis is on POE because of the dominance of the SOEs in the local economy and there is a need for POE to go overseas to tap on overseas markets.The idea to develop the external wing is not the Chinese concept but it was first mooted by the Japanese via Flying Geese Model. In a nutshell, Japan was tapping on the relative low-cost countries surrounding it like Thailand, Malaysia etc during the 80s to form a supply chain between Japan and those countries as the Japanese production costs were rising then. With manufacturing costs in Shenzhen more expensive vis-à-vis the costs of its neighbouring countries and the next Shenzhen aka Chongqing is in the hinterlands which would take time to develop the transportation network via Belt-and-Road Initiative (BRI); hence the Chinese companies are venturing overseas during this juncture to develop the global Chinese supply chain.If you look at the profile of the Chinese enterprises venturing overseas, the Chinese SOEs are focusing on infrastructure, energy etc whilst POEs are from manufacturing, property, e-commerce sectors etc. Indeed, if you look at the Apr 2018 report of “Evaluation of the Influences of Chinese Enterprises on Belt-And-Road (BRI)” (一带一路” 企业影响力评价报告) published by China State Information Center, one could see a good representation of POEs amongst the Top 50 influential Chinese enterprises :The POEs in the Top 50 include the e-commerce players like Alibaba and Tencent, conglomerates like Wanda, property firm Country Garden 碧桂园, IT company Lenovo etc.So I don’t think SOEs are posing a threat since you will be seeing more and more Chinese POEs investing overseas. As for the second part of the question on whether SOE should receive the same market access as POE, I think you are referring to the unique feature of SOE-dominant economy in China but I am seeing more and more POEs emerging in China and so the current dominance of SOEs might not be sustainable in the long run.As for the countries which are worried about Chinese SOEs investing in their economies, they should not be unduly paranoid. The Chinese SOEs are there to make profits because they have the vast experiences with so many projects done in China. The issue here is that the Chinese banks are awash with cash and they want to invest in other countries by promising attractive loans to diversify their risks and it is up to individual country to have a reasonable bargain and not to overcommit so that it is a win-win solution. For a understanding of BRI, please see my answer Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) : My observations by David BK Tan on China Boleh!For e.g., Thailand went through a tough negotiation process with China to build the Sino-Thai HSR but that does not hamper itself from appealing to the Chinese to invest in its Eastern Economic Corridor Project.

57,"China's SOEs are much like the so called ""bigs"" in the oil industry (Shell, BP, etc.) Food (P&G, PepsiCo, etc.), media (Murdoch... but each country has its sets of Murdochs), soft drinks (Coke and pepsi), seeds and agro (Monsanto), Pharma (Pfizer, Merck...), Accountancy (PWC, Deloitte...).They are not a threat to privatized economies - just as these companies are not a threat either. But just like these companies, the SOEs have a large advantage (free markets anyways was always a myth as certain companies have had an unfair edge for more than a century) .They should be given the same access to markets as these ""biggies' are given. Since the biggies are given unfettered access to markets, so should these SOEs.Let me be honest. I frankly think that in any country, local companies which provide jobs for locals and taxes to the local government should be given better market access than any of these biggies in order to provide a more level playing field. For example: a family grocer or small store in the UK should be given better access to markets than Tesco and Lidl as the latter (a) have more funds at their disposal and hence ability to take large losses for more time and (b) are easily able to register themselves offshore (Lidl is registered in Bermuda where the tax they pay on profits is zero. A family grocer has to bay taxes on the profits he/she earns in the UK at a rate higher than zero!). But since there is no chance of governments wizening up to this, or till the governments start to really make the playing field fair, I think Chinese SOEs should get the required access to markets.An alternative viewpoint:Of course, markets could get smarter and tell the SOEs (or their governments) that they would prefer a quid pro quo. Give Chinese SOEs free access to markets when China gives access to its markets to your companies.But then, how many countries do we have today that have the sense or guts to protect their people?

65,"Thanks for the A2A.The short answer is I don’t think the Chinese economy will break like the Japanese economy in the 90s and here’s why :Japanese recessions in the 90s was a result of its first deflation from 1995-2005 aka “The (First) Lost Decade”. In the context of answering this question, I would define deflation as a result of a substantial decline in aggregate demand and in a nutshell, deflation is a symptom and the cause is that majority of Japanese companies/consumers had become savers because they had too much debts and so they had to repay the debts first. In so doing, they could not spend like before and hence it had impacted the overall consumption and investments. The Japanese debts were the result of the built-up of a huge asset price bubble and the bursting of it that caused so much disruption to the Japanese.Recession is usually defined as contraction in the GDP for at least two quarters consecutively and below chart from Trading Economics depicts that its GDP was in a drastic fall from 1996 to 1998. The inflation rate was low but picked up in 1997 which I think it was because Japan introduced a consumption tax hike in April 1997 which increased the prices of core item that led to the “higher” inflation.Asset Price BubblesThe asset price bubbles in the case of Japan were in the asset classes of property and stocks. The Nikkei rose to the historical high of 38,957 in 1989 and the highest after that was 24,129 in Jan 2018 which was still about 38% off its peak in 1989!Economist Richard Koo had produced the below chart (see https://slideplayer.com/slide/43...) to compare the housing bubbles in both Japan and the U.S. during their asset price bubbles:The above information clearly shows the severity of Japan’s asset price bubbles and China is not at such level because:i. Its stock markets are not as open as Nikkei as foreign hot monies are always one major culprit of any stock bubbleii. Property bubbles do exist in some first-tier cities in China but it was a nationwide problem in Japan thenLearn from OthersIn addition, there are some mitigating factors that could help China not to repeat Japan’s scenario:i. History is the Best TeacherThe Chinese have a keen interest in history and hence they have an idiom 前车之鉴 which means to learn a lesson from the mistakes of one's predecessor. I have read on the Chinese websites on how to avoid Japanese deflation as early as last decade and because of the Japanese experience, I believe the Chinese leaders are much vigilant in not repeating the Japanese mistakes.Also, China did experience deflationary pressures during 1998-2002 due to the onset of Asian Financial Crisis and the Chinese government does have some experiences in fighting deflationary pressures since it is deleveraging now.ii. Government Debt is lowAbove is the global debt situation of major economies in 2016 from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) as reported by China Power website, see link.To fight the debt problem, the Chinese government must reduce both Corporate and Household debts now and avoid incurring too much government debts in providing liquidity to avoid hard landing which was the mistake the Japanese made to fight its deflation. It could do so as the government debt is quite low at about 40% and so there is some slack to inject liquidity.So we are seeing drastic action last year such as getting big spenders like Wanda and HNA Group to dispose their overseas assets and the nationalisation of Anbang Insurance Group. Such action would auger well for China though we would see GDP growth slowing down due to its debt deleveraging.You might want to read my answers on the related topics of deflation/Chinese debt:David BK Tan's answer to Why are people so focused on the US debt, when Chinese debt is larger than the US as a percentage of GDP and is growing much more quickly (US has lessened since 2012, Chinese has grown 80%)?David BK Tan's answer to Will continuing yuan depreciation in China in July 2018 lead to Chinese domestic inflation?David BK Tan's answer to Why is the Chinese economy slowing down?

66,"Japan in the 1990s was a vast Credit Bubble economy. Some people suggest that China has a vast Credit Bubble now - but it is impossible to really know for sure (as Chinese figures are not as clear and reliable as they might be).Also there is a question of scale. Japan was trying to overtake the United States as an economic power - but Japan is a relatively small country with limited natural resources, and a population vastly smaller than of the United States. In short Japan was trying to do something that it simply did not have the ability to do - so it was bound to, eventually, fail.China is a vast country - just as big as the United States, and with a population more than three times larger than that of United States. China is NOT trying to do the impossible in trying to overtake the United States as an economic power, it is quite possible that China (with its vastly greater population - and very efficient privately owned manufacturing industry) will overtake the United States, both economically and militarily. The Chinese military is rapidly becoming a high tech force - and I have great respect for them.For every Japanese there are more than ten Chinese - and most Chinese are hardworking and intelligent (not to say that the Japanese are not hard working and intelligent - but numbers do matter). Japan had no realistic chance of overtaking the United States and broke under the strain of trying to do so - the situation of China is somewhat different.Westerners, such as myself, should look on the rise of China with alarm - but that does not mean we do not respect the Chinese.

85,"Well, I will talk about one key difference between reforms in state owned/private owned industries:China is privatizing the SoE only if said industry cannot be efficiently organized by the state. USSR privatized for the sake of privatization.There are multiple impact of this.During the privatization process, people will make mistake. It is perfectly understandable, because people make mistake, particular when trying out new things and shift into unfamiliar territory. In the Chinese model, there are still a lot of stable SoE left to ensure even if you made a mistake, you are still keeping your bottom line. Russians, not so much.In the same line of thinking, Chinese SoE also tends to occupy sectors vital for social stability. For example, you don’t want your power to go out just because your electric company made a mistake in managing their finance. Water, sewerage, food supply. This may not sound much, but if you don’t have them for even a few days, this can be very destructive on people’s lives. Russian did not have the safety net. This means if they made a mistake in their company (again, it is natural for mistake to happen), the impact is directly felt. In comparison, there are plenty of failed Chinese private companies, but at the end of the day, when they come home, they’d still have water, electricity and heat.SoE are MAJOR contributors to the taxation. Unlike private industries, SoE contributes significantly larger portion of its revenue to the state. For example, about 56% of the Chinese tax income today (which means money towards science, infrastructure, military, education, healthcare, etc) comes from SoE despite it is much smaller than the private sector. Which also contribute to the next issueThe rapid privatization of the economy created oligarchs who are significant political and economic factions which already destabilize the country. In addition, losing SoE from point 3 also means the government has even less funding to work with, which further compound the issue.Basically, people are forgetting the purpose of privatization in the first place. Privatization is meant to happen if the situation is too complex for the state to directly manage. This is because the state, like all real world organizations, have limited administrative power and limited information input. This means the state can’t effective cover all the minor details. In this case, a more on site management may provide better efficiency. This is why in modern companies you have project management and then you have on site management.The on-site management (private owner) may be less skilled and experienced in managing the business and their available trade connections with the greater economy is more limited, but since they have more direct contact with the actual details, so it may overall improve the performance. This, however, is NOT guaranteed.What USSR did is effectively disband the project management and let the on site manager run free with the money (resources). What China did is effectively delegate certain tasks to the on site management and let them make their own decision, but the key decisions (project spending, overall scope, etc) still rests with the company. Guess which one is actually closer to the real world business model.When talking about economic reform, it is also remember that privatization is NOT the objective. Privatization does not generate wealth and privatization do not improve the economy and lives of people. The objective is always better economic performance through higher efficiency. If said privatization process cannot provide better efficiency (especially when taking into account of impacts on other aspects of social stability), then it is not going to improve anything.Blind privatization may enrich a small group of individuals (said group though, may hire a lot of voices in social media), but it is detrimental to the overall economy.",3,0.116076505798728,0.36061167227833896,0.9974770924902729

89,"Thanks for your A2A.Great Depression is a term that refers to the prolonged American recession during the 1930s and the common scenarios that epitomise such situation are :i. Substantial bank and company failuresii. Persistent high unemployment rateThe main culprit of the Great Depression was the massive bank failures as it means that people lost their deposits and the companies could not borrow from the banks as they went under. For some understanding of the bank failures, you can refer to the Fed’s history on its website, banking panic in 1930–31.China is currently not at the stage of Great Depression as there is no report of bank failures and unemployment rate was reportedly 3.89% in March 2018 based on CEIC data.Some westerners and even Mainland Chinese might question about the seemingly low unemployment in China given that its economy is always restructuring itself.But you would discover that such obfuscation is not just a Chinese feature. There is an increase in underemployed workers globally rather than unemployed workers especially in a no. of advanced economies and China after Global Financial Crisis (GFC). Most of the professionals who lost their jobs during GFC had to lower their expectations to become non-permanent workers (or gig workers for political correctness) and they would be classified as “employed” in the labour statistics and so it is not China which obfuscates such employment situation.For e.g., no one really knows the no. of gig workers in the U.S. as “To date, private estimates of the size of the gig economy have varied wildly, with economists calculating that non-traditional work arrangements account for anywhere between 0.1% of full-time employment and 34%.” See US gig economy: data shows 16m people in 'contingent or alternative' workAs far as I am aware, those Chinese who are retrenched due to re-structuring would have no qualms working as gig workers as they have a family to support and being pragmatic people, the Chinese would just lower their expectations first instead of wallowing in self-pity. This is because the Chinese culture stresses on hard work and you will be looked down if you are idling. Hence there is Chinese idiom i.e. 吃得苦中苦,方为人上人i.e. you can achieve glory and wealth only if you overcome the harshest hardship.Indeed, if one looks at the recent survey of Meituan 美团, the leader in China’s food delivery service, one could see that there was a 3% of the overall food delivery dispatchers previously working in the Corporate sector which suggests that this group could be the underemployed workers aka gig workers.Lesser Version of Great Depression of Modern EraIt is unlikely we will see a country experiencing the sort of Great Depression in the 30s as there are a lot of tools to prevent Bank Failure which is the main culprit. For example, the country can borrow monies from IMF to recapitalise the banks if need be even it is heavy in debts.Also, as we are living in a world of international trade, the affected countries (except EU members) could devaluate its currency to sell more to prevent mass unemployment. It would be difficult to do so in the 30s since there was minimum global trade.We were close to Global Depression though during the GFC as major global banks were technically bankrupt and hence some U.S. banks were merged and some UK banks were nationalised. There was a global rescue operation to prevent the Global Depression as the affected countries threw in a lot of monies via fiscal and monetary stimuli. Unfortunately, this caused global debts to escalate and hence the world is awash with a debt glut now. I dub the current situation as a “Lesser Version of Great Depression” since a lot of countries including Emerging Markets and the biggest economy and the second biggest economy are having debt problems.There is no easy solution out there. From the lender’s perspective, you want the borrower to deleverage first before you would lend more and when a country deleverages, there is less liquidity and people/companies save more (either to repay debts or as emergency savings) that would mean less consumption/company investments which would affect the economy. Thus when Greece borrowed monies from IMF, it had to undergo austerity measures and reports on Greece’s recovery 10 years after GFC seem contradictory The Brussels Times - Greece on track but economic situation contradictoryIn the case of the U.S.. Trump is going the opposite direction of trying “reflate” its economy by incurring more debts. But because its current government debt to GDP ratio is more than 100% (see below chart which is taken from the Fed’s database) , it is like a scenario that a person is incurring more debts than what he earns and it is a big risk if you are already his creditor. Hence some countries are selling off their holdings of U.S. treasuries now to minimise the risks and Trump will have difficulties to finance his spending from foreigners in the future. See Russia Sells Off Record Amount of US Treasury BondsIn addition to the debt problems faced by the major economies, we are also in a transition involving great disruptions:Multipolarity versus unipolarity when the U.S. was clearly the sole hegemony after WW2Technology Disruptions as there is a race to use technology substitutes in place of labour such as Germany’s “Industrial 4.0” and China’s “Manufacturing 2025”Backlash against globalisation as witnessed by Trump’s trade wars and BrexitGlobal ageing society involving most major economies meaning the governments need to spend more by increasing taxes and more seniors are becoming savers due to low-pay job or insufficient savings. So the increase in taxes and less consumption due to increased seniors would mean less overall consumption which would impact economic growthJapan’s deflation experience could somewhat portend what we would probably see in the future. Japan faced disruptions such as ageing society, high corporate debts initially before the companies went on to repair their balance sheets, more government debts to support the seniors and also to stimulate the economy when the companies were deleveraging etc. Due to such disruptions, the non-permanent workers started to increase when deflation started as indicated by the data from Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare as it shows about 37% of the Japanese workforce were non-permanent workers in 2015, up by about 17% when it was 20% in 1995 which was when deflation started.Hence in this current era, I think the yardstick to measure the “Lesser Version of the Great Depression” experienced by individual country is the no. of non-permanent workers in the economy, and not unemployed workers.",3,0.08992609582059125,0.3637054026503568,0.9766938719788053

However, the GDP of China is 74 trillion yuan, the total debt is 330% of the total GDP in 2016, internationally, in general, when this ratio reaches to 200% will be a clear sign for economic crises.2, the real estate bubble.Some economists estimate that currently, the real estate bubble of China has been risen to 400 trillion yuan, it is about 60 trillion in US dollar, comparing with the GDP of China in 2017 is only 12 trillion in US dollar, the ratio is 5:1.3, the bubble of RMB.In march 2018, the broad money supply of China is about 174 trillion yuan (USD 26 trillion), economists recognize that this figure more than the USA’s broad money supply pulse the EU’s together.However, the fact is in 2017, USA makes the GDP of USD 19 trillion, European Union with USD 17, and China is only USD 12 trillion.From Money supply M2 in Eurozone 2001-2017 | Statistic, in 2017, the M2 money supply in the U.S. amounted to approximately 13.84 trillion U.S. dollars, it is 73% of the 2017 USA’s GDP.In Eu, the value of money supply M2 amounted to approximately 11.2 trillion euros as of December 2017, is 65% of the 2017 EU’s GDP.Incredibly, in 2017, in China the ratio is more than 200%.If the above statistics are correct, China may have already had a great trouble in economic area.If yes, how could they pull themselves out of it?The first step is to avoid the trading war with the USA at this moment to reduce the possibility of the economic disaster of China.The Second step is to conduct the economic and political reform as soon as possible to establish a healthy, normal and modern state of 21 century.…If China can successfully receive the help from the USA, any thing will become far easier, otherwise, we just can wait to see what will happen in China, maybe any action which is taken by the government of the PRC at this moment is too late.To have a correct attitude to achieve the forgiveness of others is always a reasonable way to correct any mistake which is taken by yourself.",1,0.11812500000000001,0.47229166666666667,0.0035609056149557205

96,"The US threat to destroy China with economic and military threats. Though China is moving towards domestic consumption, trade still plays a huge part of China’s development. The BRI is a key indicator of that development. America’s tariff threat is not the tariffs, so much, as the economic destruction of world trade. It hurts all countries, including China.Trump has a simple mind and thinks that by attacking more China imports, he can outlive China by overwhelming China with tariffs for the entire China imports (about $500 billion). His simple thinking is that China can only retaliate on $125 billion of US exports to China. He forgets about things like: a ‘service’ trade surplus of $270 billion , a positive FDI of $348 billion by other countries in the US, inbound tourism worth about $32 billion annually, foreign students studying in the US worth about $30 billion to the US economy, and the big whopper is the sales by US companies manufacturing and operating in China. US retail sales in China’s domestic market is about $600 billion, more than the value of China exports to the US. Trump will not only destroy trade, but all of the above. Media thinks the US will win this trade war because of their simple thinking like Trump. They have not looked at the total picture. By the time they realize the damage, it will be too late.“America has large and growing trade surpluses for services.

97,"Let me start out by noting that there are a large number of China-philes (trolls?) on this site. No matter the topic, from their agricultural prowess, to their military, to their technology, to their educational, system. China by 2025 is going to dominate the world, the solar system, indeed the universe. Everyone else, is going to be working in a zombie trance, mumbling mandarine at some Chinese owned company making widgets to feed the Chinese Borg (Borg (Star Trek) - Wikipedia).Let’s just start out with the basics shall we?Technology: Chinese innovation is based entirely on copying, modifying, reengineering intellectual property that they (PRC) have stolen. Since 1957 there have been exactly 5 Nobel Prizes awarded to recipients born, educated and living in China (List of Chinese Nobel laureates - Wikipedia). That’s right F-I-V-E. Take away 1 Peace Prize and 1 Literature you’re left with 3. I don’t want to turn this into a pissing contest between the PRC and US, so let’s spot China 30 years and let’s just look at US based Nobel Laureates since 1987: Physics 45 (List of Nobel laureates in Physics - Wikipedia ) Physiology/Medicine 40 (List of Nobel laureates in Physiology or Medicine - Wikipedia) Chemistry 41 (List of Nobel laureates in Chemistry - Wikipedia). Presumably, all of our technological innovations/advances; everything that we use in our military, industry, businesses, homes can be traced back to basic scientific research. From 1987–2016 the US has filed 40% more world patents than the PRC (https://www3.wipo.int/ipstats/Ip...). Those are just filings folks not patents actually granted. If you add all the patents filed by the PRC since 1987 (6.3M) 82% have been filed since 2010, THAT’S RIGHT BOYS AND GIRLS 82% compare that to the US which since 1987 has filed 8.8M patents of which 40% have been filed since 2010. What does that tell you ? Did the PRC technological prowess exponentially improve since 2010 or did they become more proficient at theft. Perkins Coie, LLP one of the largest Tier 1 Patent Law Firms in the world estimated in 2016 32% of China’s World Patent Applications were either denied or challenged in the courts in various international jurisdictions. While there is no way to know how much intellectual property is actually stolen by PRC theft rings, we do know they use various modus operandi such as forced joint ventures, inspections, hacking, employee theft, corporate espionage, etc. Below (taken off the FBI website:Intellectual Property Theft/Piracy News, I’ve listed just 10 of the most recent cases fully adjudicated in Federal Court involving Chinese Nationals stealing technology on behalf of the PRC, there are hundreds more:Former Chemours Employee Pleads Guilty To Theft Of Trade Secrets Conspiracy In Bid To Lure Chinese Investors Into Sodium Cyanide MarketChinese Scientist Sentenced to Prison In Theft of Engineered RiceChinese Company Sinovel Wind Group Convicted of Theft of Trade SecretsDual Canadian/Chinese Citizen Arrested for Attempting to Steal Trade Secrets and Computer InformationMiddlesex County, New Jersey, Man Charged With Theft Of Trade Secret Materials From DupontCitizen of China Sentenced to 15 Months in Prison for Trafficking in Counterfeit Computer ChipsArkansas Man Pleads Guilty to Making False Statements About Plan to Steal Rice SeedsChinese nationals sent to prison for two years for stealing $1.5 million from GoodyearCitizen of China Sentenced to 15 Months in Prison for Trafficking in Counterfeit Computer ChipsIrvine Engineer Named in New Indictment Alleging Theft of Trade Secrets from Two Medical Device CompaniesEnough about this subject.EconomicsCentral Intelligence AgencyLet’s turn now to the economics of the PRC. This wondrously wealthy juggernaut has a “Middle Class” totalling 300M-400M. Wow! There’s just one little detail, median middle class income based on a study by Mckinsey uses a range of 75,000 to 280,000 yuan ($11,500 to $43,000) per year. 53% of the so called Middle Class makes less than $15,000 (How well-off is China's middle class?). The US, that decrepit, deteriorating, know nothing, do nothing piece of excrement classifies its middle class as falling between $42,000 to $125,000 (before tax). 91M people in China have to live on less than $2.00 per day. 4% of its people over the age of 15 (52M) are completely illiterate. China’s poverty threshold is $400.00/yr. Think of it, if you make $401 per year, you have the great relief of knowing you’re no longer poor. China has the 4th highest savings rate in the world. Why’s that? Is it that they’re just more frugal? No, in relation to the size of its population, there is no meaningful Social Safety Net.The grease that makes an economy run (any economy), is the banking system. The PRC uses its national banking system to finance the party’s growth objectives and to control its employment levels. When you hear that China is “dumping” some kind of widget in its export markets, it means that somewhere within its borders there is a business making the widget at a higher price than it’s selling it for. In other words its losing money. Who’s financing these losses? The banks have BILLIONS of dollar equivalent loans that just continue to be rolled over and over and over. The principal amount will never get repaid. Shares in Chinese companies are often proffered as collateral for loans. These are privately held shares owned by holding companies, owned by other holding companies which, in turn, are owned by an agency of the military. I’ve been to China and, being a retired banker, I was struck by the phenomenon that everywhere I went, there were newly constructed buildings of all shapes and sizes which are totally empty. This in what is now supposedly the “largest economy in the world” with 1.3BN people. I say supposedly, because you can’t trust what the PRC reports. During the global economic downturn, China was mentioned numerous times in reports by the World Bank and the IMF and the WTO questioning the veracity of their economic reports. Hmmmm? Anyway, who’s financed all that construction? When are the buildings going to get occupied? Who owns them? Are they insured? The fact is that if China adhered to the BASEL III agreements regarding banking capital adequacy, loan underwriting standards, loan loss reserve requirements and charge-offs, its banking system would collapse. Why do you think yuan is not freely convertible-The yuan is the only currency held in the IMF basket of reserve currencies that isn’t freely convertible. It’s a joke.EnvironmentMost polluted cities on earth China has the top two: The World's Most Polluted Places - TIMEOf the cities with the worst air quality China has 7 of the 30:The most polluted cities in the world, rankedRemember Beijing shutting down traffic during the Olympics?Let’s move on…..I’m on a rollMilitaryThe US and China are at war.

Those of you who are infatuated with China’s war toys (all developed and manufactured using stolen intellectual property) are never going to see a full scale conventional war between ourselves. China’s history is one of isolation. It was never a hegemonic power. Its military focus is and has always been the geographic confines of greater China. It worries more about some deserted, desolate islands on the northern end of the Japanese Archipelago more than it does about Afghanistan, Iran’s nuclear aspirations or the middle east. How many military bases does China have around the world? Answer -0-. What it does have around the world are companies drilling, for oil, mining, agriculture, livestock, fishing…….The Borg (CPC) has to keep sucking up resources to take back to the mothership so its 1.3BN passengers can be fed and employed or there’s going to be hell to pay.P.S.Trump at the very worst will be gone in six more years.

99,"China’s economic development policy is actually pretty good. I can’t think of any major weaknesses in the sense that there is a better alternative policy given the conditions. China’s main economic development weakness is not at the policy level, but the execution level. Some of the policy execution is really poor, which means that good policy is irrelevant to the outcome.A good example of this is the housing bubble in China. This problem has been identified a decade ago. Not only was this problem identified by China, it was one of the major causes of the economic stagnation of Japan. So China had the opportunity to learn from the mistakes of its neighbors, saw that it is itself falling into the same trap, and failed to avoid the trap.The government of China can build more high speed rail than the rest of the world combined in less than a decade. It can order the construction of massive new islands in the South China Sea practically overnight. It can even order people to have only 1 child. Yet, it has been trying and failing to implement a property tax for 2 decades.Think about it for a minute. A communist government, failing to pass and implement a property tax, for 2 decades.

100,"The China's global economic development policy is a huge topic, here, I may only focus on one area of lending, as it is popularly happened in the the Belt and Road Initiative.A nation just likes a person to lend money to others would almost never make real friends.An typical example is the China and Vietnam relationship.For helping Vietnam to against the USA and France…forces, China provided military and economic aid to North Vietnam totally more than $20 billion (approx. $143 billion adjusted for inflation in 2015) during the Vietnam War (1 November 1955 – 30 April 1975).It is especially hard for Chinese people who suffered from the the Great Famine of China during 1958–1960 which caused at least 30 million Chinese people starving to death.As recently the American boy said during the USA TV show, the best way to get rid of the loan of China is to kill Chinese.The CCP’s Vietnamese communist comrades did the exactly the same thing as the American boy’s saying which is 30s years later.The reward of the China’s aid to Vietnam is the Sino-Vietnam War in 1979, and the sour relationship between the 2 until now.What will happen in the future?How many countries will have war and sour relationship with China?How can make Chinese people to learn the lesson from the past?Why You Shouldn’t Lend Money to Family & Friends1. Open-ended LoansLoans to family and friends tend to be open-ended. The parties don’t reach an agreement for a timeline for repayments, and don’t include interest on the loan. Lenders don’t know when their money will be returned, and borrowers don’t know when to repay the loans.This leaves both parties in limbo, and doesn’t set any expectations. The uncertainty can lead to stress as the borrower may worry that the lender expects payment and the lender worries about when he or she will be repaid. When I loaned money to a family member, it delayed my decision to buy a house.2. Loans Are Not a PriorityWith an open-ended loan, the borrower may not realize that there is a sense of urgency to repay the loan. Without a deadline, repaying the loan becomes the borrower’s last priority. The borrower won’t face any repercussions for not repaying the loan, like late payments, higher interest fees, or a negative impact on a credit score. Without the threat of penalties, the borrower has no motivation to take the loan seriously or to put any urgency around repaying it.3. It’s Difficult to Ask for the Money BackIt can be difficult to request repayment of a loan from a friend or family member. More than likely, the lender cares about the borrower, and doesn’t want the borrower to feel awkward. The lender may continue to worry about loan repayment, and thus shut down some or all communications with the borrower in order to avoid talking about the loan. The borrower becomes confused and hurt feelings can result.4. It Can Make Family Gatherings AwkwardI have loaned money to a family member, and I have also borrowed money from a family member. In both scenarios, family get-togethers were very awkward. I felt uncomfortable being around the person who loaned me money. It was also uncomfortable to be around other family members who knew about the loans.No one wants to talk about the loan or about money or even about anything that costs money, because then people might wonder why someone hasn’t repaid the loan.5. The Borrower Becomes a Servant to the LenderThe book of Proverbs in the Bible claims that the borrower becomes a servant to the lender (Proverbs 22:7.) This is exactly how I felt when I borrowed money. I felt that I had to please my lender and do everything that he suggested. I felt like I could not oppose this person in any way.6. The Borrower May Ask for MoreOnce you have lent money to a friend or family member, this person may return when he or she needs more money. In addition, other friends and family members may also ask you for a loan.7. You Enable Instead of Help Your Friend or Family MemberWhen you lend money to friends or family members, you give them an easy way out of their financial problems, instead of helping them work through their issues.For example, your cousin may ask for some money to pay off her credit card bill, but she needs help learning how to make a budget. In that situation, refuse the loan, but offer to help your cousin create a budget or to look for alternative forms of income.8. These Types of Loans Don’t Earn InterestLoaning money to friends and family costs you money. Most likely, you won’t charge interest if you give a loan to a loved one. I neither paid interest nor charged interest on my family loans. If you could invest the money that you lent to friends and family members, even through peer-to-peer lending networks like Lending Club and Prosper, you could have received interest.9. You Might Need the MoneyYou definitely want your money returned, but you may also need your money. What if you lose your job and you have no income? What if you spend your entire emergency fund while searching for a new job? What if you need to put food on the table for your kids and repayment of the loan marks the difference between you keeping your house or going into foreclosure? Not receiving repayment of the loan in a timely manner might spell disaster for you and your family.10. You Could Lose Your Money and RelationshipAs Shakespeare wrote, “For loan oft loses both itself and friend.” If you lend money to a friend or family member, beware that you may not get your money back and your relationship may never go back to normal. This will cause tension between you and the borrower, and may also cause guilt, remorse, and anger.From: 10 Reasons Why You Should NOT Lend Money to Friends & Family",0,0.024575580365054053,0.4589491405280879,0.7661908040499694

111,"YES! It is time for China to improve its economy, and, over he past two decades, it has been doing scratch good job of it.Keeping in mind that China was intentionally ruined by the British, and responded by a form of cultural adaptation similar to that used in circa 223bce, it is emerging rather well. But, given the population size, it will take time for the modern system to spread.Still, it has generated a wealthy class and my friends there report a vast improvement over the past three decades.As for the current problems with the U.S., These are rather normal territorial issues between the two main layers in the global economy. In many ways, the tariff game will help both economies focus on their own needs and internal strengths of weaknesses. The two have take different paths over the past three decades.America has outsourced key industries and pushed itself into a service economy that lacks the basic infrastructure which was once marketed by the domestic auto industry supported by other key industries which made America independently self-sufficient during the World Wars. Even now, America is bleeding the last of its oil reserves as it , in a formal governmental level, denies climate change and the need to refocus its resources toward renewables as the 21st century mainstay. China has gone in the exact opposite direction — as symbolized by the mandate of only all electric vehicles being sold/bought after 2025.The tariff war might well prove to the average American voter that Republican policies are undermining the economy and the nation is not ready for the next evolutionary step in economics and mercantile culture. A reality that could weaken it militarily and economically. As Trump effectively pointed out to NATO (without the easily obtained hard numbers provided in the QUORA discussion Why is there a sudden rivalry between Trump and Merkel? — but apparently suppressed by QUORA administrators), the 2017 contribution payments for NATO exceed the total 2017 budget deficit and, without NATO, the USA would have had a budget surplus in every year since the end of the Cold War (instead of just the years under Clinton).China is just one aspect of a series of real problems that have emerged for the USA, many of which China is insulated from due to its size and location — and the fact it is not a religious target under Koran and Biblical prophecy, the followers of which wasn't to see fulfilled through a military derived apocalypse.China WILL improve its eonomy, and make it self-contained so as to weather the storm being triggered by the jihadist movement.

117,"Thanks for the A2A. I am writing my answer based on my observations and they may or may not pan out eventually as written; so just some disclaimer here.Geography is DestinyBefore answering your question, let us see the proposed maritime routes of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Picture taken from here.As can be seen from the picture, there is a proposed China-Arctic Ocean-Europe route. This is an important route as it binds both China and Russia together because Russia wants to use this route to transport oil/Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) to cut down shipping costs and avoid the existing maritime route which the U.S. has some control.Henry Kissinger has said this before: ""Who controls the food supply controls the people; who controls the energy can control whole continents; who controls money can control the world."" My take is that we will be living in some energy crisis in future and even if you don’t believe in peak oil theory, you should take note that due to the dismal oil price since 2014, there would be less oil exploration and it would mean oil would be in short supply in some foreseeable future. This means that Russia could be a dominant player in the energy sector via this route in the long run since it has the geographical advantage over the U.S. which is now the top exporter of shale oil and both are competing for market shares now as the winner would be very powerful.Because of the collaboration of China and Russia on this route since they would benefit from it individually i.e. cargoes for China and oil/LNG for Russia; I think that this route would be realised in the new few decades or even earlier as the melting of the Arctic ice has quickened recently. As such, some European countries would certainly benefit from it and so we are seeing a shift towards welcoming the Chinese investments for these countries. For example, Finland and Norway are discussing on a so-called Arctic Corridor that would allow cargo ships from Asia to off-load in Kirkenes or elsewhere in northern Norway on the shores of the Arctic Ocean, saving thousands of nautical miles (see below diagram, taken from here). In addition, a no. of European countries is now seeking the Chinese investments for growth, notably the 16 Central and Eastern European countries which had a summit with China recently. http://www.china-ceec.org/eng/zd...So because Europe would not be in unison due to the interests of its individual countries are not aligning together, so it is impossible to take side of the U.S. in events such as trade war since some of its countries would prefer the Chinese investments in view of the inevitable paradigm shift of the new trade route.Also, if Europe takes the side of the U.S., then China could use other non-European substitutes for their imports as there are ready substitutes out there. Indeed, the Chinese Xinhua News agency reports that the pork import from EU dropped 0.1% in May this year compared to the drastic drop of 37.4% for U.S. pork import and the big gainer was Brazilian pork import which increased by 14.2%. This means that China has plans for possible European substitutes if they join forces with the U.S. in the current trade war.As for Europe taking the side of China, then it is impossible for it to do so as U.S. is the biggest consumer in the world. See Why did President Trump's administration initiate trade wars with China, Canada, Mexico and the EU all at the same time, instead of one at a time; what is the strategy there?So a neutral standing by Europe would be in its best interests.From China’s perspective, as long as Europe is not siding with the U.S., it is already a victory.",1,0.028594838967179393,0.35582074544840503,0.9967900192057262

129,"Since the start of the market reforms in 1978, China has shifted from a centrally-planned to a market-based economy and has experienced rapid economic and social development. GDP growth has averaged nearly 10 percent a year and has lifted more than 800 million people out of poverty. Although China’s GDP growth has gradually slowed since 2012, it is still impressive by current global standards. China’s annual economic growth figures have long been quite steady and high.In 2017 economic growth of China accelerated driven by a cyclical rebound in global trade. However the IMF recently stated the this strength was expected to weaken slightly in 2018 to 6.6 percent and to grow gradually to about 5.5 percent by 2023.Strength in exports, retail sales and the property market has helped spur economic growth. However, regarding these high growth rates one has to keep in mind that China’s GDP per capita is still only 15 percent of the U.S. in dollar terms, so the potential to keep on growing is high.Though presently China is the largest exporter in the world, it still remains a developing country. Further its market reforms are incomplete and there are many poor people especially in rural areas.Rapid economic growth has brought on many challenges, including high inequality; rapid urbanization; challenges to environmental sustainability; and external imbalances. The country faces demographic pressures related to an aging population and internal migration of labor.Significant policy adjustments are required in order for China’s economic growth to be sustainable. China’s 12th Five-Year Plan and the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020) forcefully addressed these issues. They highlight the development of services and measures to address environmental and social imbalances, setting targets to reduce pollution, to increase energy efficiency, to improve access to education and healthcare, and to expand social protection.According to the IMF during the press conference on the recent artical IV consultation, China has quite balanced capital flows and very large reserves.

136,"It is a common misconception that the Plaza Accord led to Japan’s lost decade, and the way the question is framed makes me think that this misconception is also at the heart of the question. Japan simply did not pivot from export-led growth to to a mature domestic market on time. The real problem at the time was that Japanese authorities were overly concerned about the effect of yen appreciation and overreacted to a slowdown in the first half of 1986, which led them the implement a sizeable macroeconomic stimulus that year.Policy interest rates were reduced by about 2 percentage points, a stance that was sustained until 1989. A large fiscal package was introduced in 1987, even though a vigorous recovery had already started in the second half of 1986. By 1987, Japan’s output was booming, but so were credit growth and asset prices, with stock and urban land prices tripling from 1985 to 1989. Then, in January 1990, the stock price bubble burst. Share prices lost a third of their value within a year, and two decades of dismal economic performance followed.Put another way, excessive stimulus was adopted in part because there was excessive concern about the impact of appreciation. The Plaza Accord had nothing to do with this.That was not all. In addition, Japanese banks were undercapitalized prior to the crisis, authorities delayed forcing banks to recognize losses after the bubble burst, and a premature fiscal tightening in 1997 may have choked off recovery, as several scholarly papers have argued.What China should worry about, when observing Japan’s Lost Decade, is that dangerous asset bubbles may currently be forming, just as they did in Japan in the late 1980s.“Credit and asset price behavior is disconcerting in China and Hong Kong SAR, showing boom-like dimensions,” the IMF said in the China Report in 2016. In both economies credit growth remains high compared with the run-ups to previous credit booms and busts, and there are mounting concerns about the potential for steep corrections in property prices and their implications.China and other fast-growing emerging economies could reap near-term benefits while ignoring nascent overheating pressures. Because of China’s sheer scale, the problem seems to be spread out, in an attempt to, as the IMF said in the aforementioned report “sow the seeds for a hard landing down the road.”On the other hand, China’s ability to control its exchange rate, and its massive foreign exchange reserves and capital restrictions should help China avoid the sharp appreciation observed in Japan. In either case, Japan was not forced into its lost decade by the Plaza Accord, it stumbled into it on its own accord!",5,-0.031192680776014114,0.3795723104056437,0.995735508769846

Economic liberalization undid the worst damage of the early Soviet policies -the War Communism of 1917–1920- and allowed the Bolsheviks to have their successful final push against the whites. Leon Trotsky came on board after he had been sent to violently suppress the Kronstadt Rebellion, when sailors were disenchanted with Bolsjevik food rationing. The Bolsjeviks never meant the NEP to be Party and State policy for a longer period of time. It was a temporary expedient on the way to full Socialism, what is now taught in Chinese Party schools as Socialism with Soviet Characteristics.When Deng Xiaoping unfastened the great gate of opening and reform, many in the Chinese Communist Party believed his was another New Economic Policy. They were wrong, it brought changes to Socialism with Chinese Characteristics that have in turn changed the entire world and lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty.One of the reasons China could lift so many people out of poverty is the fact that the west allowed it to compete on the world market. The USSR and the Warsaw Pact countries, by comparison, were cordoned off from the world market (they effectively created their own centrally planned intranational market with disastrous consequences).Bill Clinton said, after he got 73 Democrats and 167 Republicans voting in favor of China joining the WTO: “In 10 years from now we will look back on this day and be glad we did this. We will see that we have given ourselves a chance to build the kind of future we want.” Can you imagine a 1960s President say that about the USSR joining the international trade body?",2,0.12492668621700882,0.4997556207233627,0.9944011899307554

Chinese reforms effectively ended socialism (communism is not a correct term) and created governmet capitalism. Chins is happy to sell its labor force to the Western companies. Also, Chinese economy is propped by Western investments and would tank if Western factories close and money are withdrawn.Soviet Union would never do that kind of reforms since West was an enemy.

149,"Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on both Mexican and Canadian metal imports advanced the level of trade tensions that were already present in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).President Enrique Peña Nieto and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau rebuked the United States’ decision to move towards protectionism which just escalates the issues across the borders. Trump, has floated the idea that the U.S. would like to get separate deals with its two neighbors because he feels he can bully his weight better with the parties in isolationWhen trump introduced the new tariffs very little progress had been accomplished on NAFTA since Mexico’s Guajardo and Canada’s chief negotiator, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, have charged that breakup of the treaty will isolate Mexico and Canada and thus, will have to deal individually with the weight of the US economy leaning on them for greater concessions.Former United States commerce secretary Carlos Gutierrez described the tariffs as being part of a “gun-to-the-head negotiating style” that actually made it more difficult to agree to a deal “without committing suicide domestically.”It has been reported that more than 50 dairy groups wrote to Trump and urged him to drop the tariffs, because it would only benefit producers in the European Union, which reached a new trade agreement with Mexico in April. Besides imposing its own retaliatory tariffs, Mexico will challenge the United States’ at the World Trade Organization on the grounds that Trump’s tariffs violate international trade rules.Canada has responded to the US tariffs on steel and aluminum by imposing billions worth of counterweighting tariffs. In the meantime, Mexico placed duties on food and steel and the EU vowed its own retaliatory tariffs for Trump’s decision to slap tariffs on steel and aluminum from the European Union which has sharply escalated global trade and amplified a rift with America’s closest allies. This will result without a doubt in condemnation and retaliation as well as multilateral challenges at the World Trade Organization.Canadian leaders reacted particularly angrily to the tariffs, that Trump had justified on the grounds of national security which is offensive to Canadian officials who have called it absurd, illogical and illegal. France’s Macron said in a speech after the US announcement. “Economic nationalism leads to war. This decision is not only unlawful but it is a mistake in many respects.”International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde meanwhile warned the G7 officials of an erosion of trust saying that the action will “distort and damage and disrupt supply chains which have been established now for decades”.“This is protectionism, pure and simple,” said Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the EU Commission, which represents the 28-member states in the union. He added the US “now leaves us with no choice” but to impose duties on American imports, but without specifying the exact amount or timing of the retaliationMany U.S. manufacturers have well-developed supply chains within NAFTA while allies need to gang up against the US illegal actions the fight might be long and sustained until something brakes. Trump’s invocation of national security to justify tariffs just opened a Pandora’s Box because similar claims can be made by other nations resulting in a never ending loop with an escalating threat to no end in sight.No one is really surprised when Trump in a day an hour later or in the same sentence contradicts himself. When it comes to policy, he doesn’t know anything and he doesn’t care to know.

150,"The impact in China for its citizen of the trade war will be very minimal.The manufacturing sector of all electronics will always be the dominant sector in China and there are no real competitors that could meet their capacities and experiences. All those shouting of intellectual properties stealing is B.S. Intel and Apple and many more are producing their computer electronic parts in China and nobody outside the manufacturers and the owner of the process knows what is inside the products. Nothing is leaked out. This is called cooperation with mutual interest. There is no stealing involved. This is a conglomerate with international ownership.Stealing could happened by others incl. third countries, who are entering and spying the method of using the intellectual properties. Every patent could be checked in any patent office and is open to everybody. Having the knowledge of the patent doesn’t mean they could already be able to copy the process in their production line. Having the knowledge of a patent is not stealing. Only if it is being used in the production it stealing if you don/t pay for it. For stealing there are court procedures. ——- There are NO court procedures against any Chinese manufacturer at this moment,like i.e Apple and Samsung. These 2 are stealing from each other. In manufacturing there is a contract of non disclosure.Putting tariffs under false accusations will not decrease the production or the sales since this is controlled by the market and not by politics. Result Chinese manufacturers will feel in decrease in activities but will not feel the cost. The cost will be forwarded to the user and the buyer of the product and that will be forwarded to the consumer. The consumers are the US-population.Checking from the import prospective of China. China put tariffs on their import of soybean, pork or fruits etc from the US. The result the import from the US will be more expensive. China has alternative sources to buy it from. Brasil could easily export their beef , soybean, coffee, corn etc to China for a much cheaper price. End decision, as a good business person - find another source for the product. Who will loose now ?. The US producer since there is no market anymore. Soybean will after 1 year or 2 go into the garbage dump as compost. This soybean will still go to the consumer if the US government subsidize it with the % of the tariffs. If however Trump didn’t discard the TPP, a union initiated by this black dude from Africa; Trump has a helper and a weapon. The TPP could banned the export of soybean to China by any of its member.

So China easily imports the most soybeans from the US. What’ll happen now that the US has imposed major tariffs on China? China made retaliatory tariffs on US soybeans (and other US exports).

152,"Thanks for the question.Trump’s trade war will have limited impact on China’s economy. Let me explain why.In order to understand how US tariffs will impact China, you first have to see what China exports to the US. According to World Bank, in 2016, consumer and capital goods form the majority of China’s exports to the US. In consumer goods, electronics form the majority. Same applies to capital goods.You can look it out at the World Bank website:China | Export (US$ Thousand) | Sector | Export | to United States | 2012Now, China manufactures 51% of all electronics in the world. And they produce the 25% of machine tool. If the US decides to put a tariff on China’s imports, there will be virtually NO SUBSTITUTES available to US factories and consumers in the short term and the medium term. Why do I say that?Well, given China’s dominance in the markets where US imports, the immediate impact will be higher prices on American factories and consumers. 100% of the tariff impact will fall on the US. There is no way to switch production from off-shore to onshore.In the medium term, factories will relocate based on a few factors:costvicinity to suppliers (supply chain effect)vicinity to markets.Cost will be one of major factors. Cost can be split by labour cost, regulatory cost, tax, infrastructure cost (power, transportation etc). If the US can cut all of these to be LOWER than the rest of world, they technically can shift some production onshore. But given the gap between US costs and developing countries, it would require a MASSIVE decline in standard of living in the US. This is called internal cost adjustment. Alternatively, they can crash the USD. This is called external cost adjustment. But this will destroy US’ exorbitant privilege and again lead to massive pain for the US populace (high inflation with stagnant incomes)The second is more difficult replicate. Manufacturers require a network of suppliers to be able to produce efficiently. China has built the greatest ecosystem for manufacturers in the world. In terms of competitive suppliers, infrastructure to deliver and send goods, and efficiency, there is NO country in the world that can compete. Even if the US can convince manufacturers to move to the US, it will take at least a decade for US to create the network of suppliers required to fully onshore (and that is an aggressive time line). Just look at how long it took Toyota to create the network in the 90s.So in the medium term, there is also no way out of import reliance, be it for intermediate or finished goods.As for #3, if the factories are manufacturing for the US, they have the advantage. But if the factories are meant to produce for exports, the US will have a big problem to overcome: the logistical infrastructure in the US has been ignored for a long time. Massive investment is required to upgrade roads, rails, ports etc to bring it up to a standard for exporting goods. China has been investing in this for the last 3+ decades. One only has to view how many roads/rail China has built or how many ports in China are in the top 10 busiest ports in the world.So back to the question: what is the impact of the US trade tariffs on China? Unfortunately for America, it will have a negligible impact. Higher prices might reduce volumes (due to higher prices faced by US consumers and factories) but the near term impact will be small. The impact on the standard of living on Americans and on the factories in the US that rely on China’s supply chain, on the other hand, will be significant. Harley-Davidson’s decision to move some production offshore is the start of job losses in the US.China will benefit from another angle. The rest of the world will start to pivot to China for trade and gravitate away from USD based trade. But that is another story.",1,0.07786525974025975,0.4035876623376623,0.9697942662337228

159,"It’s unlikely that the real estate bubble by itself will burst country wide (because prices are not equally inflated everywhere) and in such an extreme form as in Japan.The bad news is that China has an enormous debt imbalance overall.

Another scary number is the amount of extra GDP growth per Yuan invested, which is going downhill rapidly.So the overall problem is not just some real estate bubble, but a large amount of unproductive investment. This COULD if not properly managed result in a hard landing of the economy. The Chinese government right now is worried about a trade war with Trump not because the Chinese economy is weak per se. But rather because a minor trade war shock could drive a significant number of “bad” companies into bankruptcy and then create a ripple effect of bad debt defaulting.

163,"The United States sold China their skylines, they buy their beautiful skyscrapers from us.The three tallest skyscrapers in Shanghai are Jin Mao, World Financial Center, and Shanghai Tower.:This kind of super-tall skyscraper architectural expertise is globally dominated by American architecture firms. Note that, other than the Oriental Pearl Observation Deck, these three buildings tower above all others in the Shanghai skyline. Most of the rest of Shanghai are much shorter, much simpler background buildings.These three comprise the defining “signature towers” of Shanghai’s skyline..Shanghai Tower:Let’s look at Shanghai Tower, the world’s second tallest building. It was designed by Gensler of San Francisco. And like virtually all commercial buildings, it was designed using AutoCad software, which also happens to be based in San Francisco. It’s the industry standard, used by most all firms. The elevators are Mitsubishi, they were shipped in from Japan (they’re the fastest in the world). The world’s largest elevator company is Otis of Connecticut, but alas, they lost out on all three of these contracts..Shanghai World Financial Center:Then there is the Shanghai World Financial Center, designed by the New York offices of Kohn Petersen Fox. It was originally to have had a circular hole in the top with, I kid you not, a one loop rollercoaster in it. But that was too expensive. It was cheaper to build with a square hole, so the developers asked them to change the design to cut costs. For this one Toshiba of Japan designed the elevators.Here’s a computer rendering of the original World Financial Center design:Kohn Petersen Fox also designed the Hudson Yards development, the largest real estate development in NYC history, and currently still under construction (Otis did get that elevator business). I hear a lot of people say, “Hudson Yards looks a bit Chinese,” a little ironic, given KPF has defined so many Chinese skylines, including Hong Kong (with a little help from César Pelli in Connecticut).Still, the World Financial Center‘s square cutout didn’t turn out too shabby:.Jin Mao Tower:Jin Mao Tower was designed by Skidmore Owings & Merrill (SOM), headquartered in Chicago.SOM is most famous for designing more skyscrapers than any architect firm in the world, including their hometown’s Sears Tower (as well as the tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa, in Dubai). For Jin Mao Tower, Mitsubishi of Japan won the elevator business again.The new rise of China has been a wonder of our modern age.When Chinese engineers began construction of the Oriental Pearl TV / Radio Tower & Observation Deck in 1991, on the industrial side of Huangpu River, there was nothing there but Communist era factories.The future site of the Shanghai skyline, looking across from the “old city” only 30 years ago:China built rapidly mostly by partnering with American companies, to provide manufacturing, leveraging their low cost labor. They have a huge, almost unlimited labor pool.Most of the Chinese still live in the interior, and remain some of the poorest in the world.But that’s changing.For now, the coastline has developed into a bustling modern metropolis, and they can afford to buy the best skyscrapers U.S. architects can design (with the fastest elevators Japan can sell).Most IP is developed here in the States. Apple designs their computers and iPhones—from their processors, their industrial design, their software all in the U.S.—buys screens from Korea, other components from Israel and Taiwan… with final assembly done in China, because labor is still very economical.China’s next struggle will be building up a substantial domestic consumer market and moving higher up the value chain, in order to keep momentum, as their growth has begun to slow.As for the U.S., we’ve invested too much in war, and neglected domestic infrastructure.

164,"This is a common question asked by Chinese actually. Many Chinese go to America or Australia and find the cities look less fancy than the mega cities in China. Many Chinese even call Australia “coarse” and call America a “village”. For some people, tall buildings, bridges, and roads are the symbols of development, it’s actually what Chinese government tries to tell its people. Turn on any Chinese TV channel, when they talk about China’s economy or development, they present footages of modern buildings, roads, construction… time after time, many Chinese have been misled and forgot the true meaning of development.Development is not about “looking” good. There are many tall buildings in Shanghai, less tall buildings in Sydney and Washington. But where do people live in Shanghai? Small apartments floating in the air with high prices, like 12,000 US dollars per square meter? which most middle-class people find difficult to afford, so parents have to give away all their savings to buy a small flat for their kids?? Yes, I’ve seen so many tall buildings in Shanghai, so what? well, in Sydney, many people actually live in houses, not flats, houses may not look that fancy as high apartments, but people do have more space living in houses and feel more comfortable..so who cares about “looking” ？Also I don’t just see tall buildings in Chinese mega cities, also in small cities with population having very low income… High-rises and “modern” looking have nothing to do with development in China, it has become some image projects and been used to generate profit for some people. Not only Shanghai, many small Chinese cities can look more “modern” than downtown Sydney.(a “modern” looking ghost town, picture from Baidu)So let’s not forget the real meaning of “development”. It’s not about power, nor about look. It’s about making a better life for people. If Shanghai were really more advanced than Sydney or New york, then why do most Shanghai people I’ve talked to want to immigrate to the west? According to Huffpost, “Hurun Report surveyed 304 Chinese individuals with a net worth between US$1.5 million (C$1.9 million) and US$30 million (C$38 million).Slightly less than half of the respondents said they are either considering emigrating from China or planning to do so.

165,"It depends on which cities you are visiting when you go to both countries. If you compare Shanghai and Hong Kong to NYC and San Francisco - they are all metropolitan. Certain pockets of Shanghai and Hong Kong will be “newer” than NYC and San Francisco, and vice versa.I’ve had friends from Hong Kong who put the Silicon Valley into their top travel destinations list, only to feel disappointed after visiting. One remarked why Caltrain looked more like “Thomas and Friends” than the Japanese Shinkansen. Yet two others made the mistake of walking from the Stanford Caltrain station to the Stanford campus and ended up walking 45 minutes in 30C/85F heat. Travelling via light-rail and Caltrain from the Yahoo campus to the Stanford campus could take a good two-hours (or more) on a Friday afternoon.I guess it boils down to two things:Differences in regime and how each regime deals with infrastructure:Infrastructure (and public transportation) requires a lot of government money and oversight. Both countries put a lot of money into infrastructure (China in building, US in both building and maintaining existing ones.) It’s a lot easier for the communist regime to push or enforce infrastructure development, especially if that means buying out land to build infrastructure upon. Big Brother won’t need to care much about opposition, riots, and environmental lobbyists because all they need to do is to pay out the land owners. That’s why a high-speed rail line takes only years to complete from start to finish (China Railway Map), while it takes more than 20 years of planning and negotiation for a rail line to be built between LA and San Francisco.City Planning and Layout:Apart from a handful of cities in the Northeast (NYC, Boston, Washington D.C., etc.) and perhaps San Francisco and parts of Chicago, Americans took millennia of city planning and architectural design and threw that all away by building McMansions on cul-de-sacs (suburban sprawl) and structuring daily life on an automobile scale and not on a pedestrian scale. Prior to the advent of the automobile, most cities were built European-style - there was a town square and church in the city center, and stores, restaurants/bars would be within walking distance from the city center. People would live on the second floor (and upwards) while the first floor of a building (street level) would be for shops and restaurants. Classic example of mixed-use zoning. And there would be streetcars and trams if people had to walk more than 500m away. And the cities which were built European-style are those in the Northeast. In the Sunbelt cities (Dallas, Phoenix, LA, etc.) you’d have to drive maybe 3 miles for a gallon of milk. If you told a Parisian to drive 3 miles for a gallon of milk, they’d probably think you were crazy, but it is inherently the way of life for most Americans.Now Chinese cities may or may not have similar layout as European ones, but most do use mixed-use zoning and most places are walkable. It’s normal to live a couple of floors up from a restaurant or a store. Parking structures are either underground, above, or behind stores, not in front of them. People can still do window-shopping. If they have to walk, they can use trams, buses, subways, and the average wait time is far less than 30 min. In Hong Kong, subway ridership is 97% while light rail ridership is 8% in San Jose. Buildings are developed upwards instead of outwards. It makes the skyline and aerial view look a lot more eye-catching and interesting than miles and miles of cul-de-sacs and oasis of strip malls amongst seas of parking lots. City planning and layout also matters when it comes to telecommunications, like broadband. I can’t say for other Chinese cities, but the vast majority of households in Hong Kong use broadband - in terms of optical fiber. But most people in the Bay Area still use DSL. Optical fibers are too expensive in the suburban layout - imagine having to pay for one yourself to enter your two-story home from the main one on the street. Higher population density and highrise accommodation does make that possible in Hong Kong though.Granted, I think the US is still the global leader in technology. American technology is seen in terms of R&D, patents, and intellectual property, more so than infrastructure and public transportation. China, in my opinion, does better with regards to the latter. It is definitely a good idea, though, for Americans to put more thought into infrastructure and public transportation, as it undoubtedly affects everyday life and the quality thereof.",26,0.12804806304806304,0.40054334554334553,0.9386971139783156
166,"Because they dump all their money into the military instead of infrastructure now. If you spend all your money on aircraft carriers, there ain't a lot left over for road maintenance and the like.

One of the drawbacks of decades of tax cuts and “small government” is that the taxes needed to maintain and improve rotting infrastructure just aren't there after the big ticket items are paid for. The US interstate highway system used to be a model for other countries to emulate. Not anymore.China's boom is similar to the post war boom in infrastructure development that the US had after WWII when things like the interstate highway system were built. The US infrastructure at that time was a model for the rest of the world to aspire to. These days, the same could be said for China's newly developed infrastructure. If I wanted a high speed rail line built in my country I'd be looking at what the Chinese have done, not America.There's a bit of a perception vs. reality problem with the fact that the US has the largest economy in the world. It also has absolutely shocking levels of poverty for a developed country and an incredibly stratified distribution of wealth, again, similar to the developing country I live in.Things are nice if you live in New York or San Fran, but if you live in places like Detroit or Flint or a lot of places in the South you may as well be living in the 3rd world.",32,0.09010606060606059,0.4433030303030304,0.9947861914011021
167,"You are comparing an old civilization with a new one. A new civilization often values their recent achievements and gets all excited about new things and the latest developments. Older civilizations recognize that they have come from somewhere and have things that are valuable and should be maintained and venerated. The USA is almost 250 years old, while the PRC only started 70 years ago, less than a third the time of the USA. If you consider the cultural revolution, you could even set the clock of the PRC to the 1970s. It’s cute how so many of the advancements and problems the PRC faces reflect those of America and Britain and Germany from hundreds of years ago.As a result, many Chinese value things that are less valued in America. A classic building from the 1920s in the US would likely have fallen to the ground and been recycled in the PRC. There are tourist pieces, but the rest is fairly junky. Europeans can have a similar view of America. Your house is only 100 years old? How can you be sure it will stay up?So, as a Chinese citizen and part of a brash new culture, your point of view is skewed to value what is valued at home. To see how the USA is the largest economy, you’ll need to change your point of view and look for different things. Look for people taking their leisure. Observe basic wealth. Visit people’s homes and consider what this reflects.One day, the PRC will also have an old and established culture. They’ll sigh at the excited upstarts from Nigeria as they excitedly talk about their forward movement, how they are controlling the jungle, how air pollution is a sign of progress. The Nigerians will wonder at the stodgy Chinese, laugh at them paying tourist prices and being unwilling to eat the cheap local food. They’ll visit Chengdu to look at the pandas, and wonder why the Chinese would want such an outdated mag-lev rail system. They’ll even be embarrassed for you by your pride in having the first one.",60,0.13952328159645233,0.4349285538309928,0.9946815441534931
168,"There is a large cultural difference between between the east and west.Let’s look at 2 countries and an island country to gain a more balanced perspective to the question.ChinaYes, it’s true that modern China showcases its development in cities such as Shanghai, but that is part of an new emerging Asian culture. Do modern eastern cities represent the ‘real’ China? I would argue that if you travel across to the other side of China, to cities like Chongqing (30+ million), there is a notable lack of skyscrapers but it’s still a thriving, multicultural city.USAIn more recent times, the USA has been struggling with investing into modern infrastructure and buildings due in part to a flagging economy. They have poured $trillions into the Middle East in an attempt to promote USA global dominance. This is now beginning to change. In the last 2 years, the US mindset has begun to change and you will see an upgrade of infrastructure and a resurgence of skyscrapers.Yet, it’s also true that the USA, while wanting to look successful in terms of infrastructure and buildings, is also attempting to focus on other issues such as the quality of lifestyle, social justice and personal freedoms. However, according to media reports, even these democratic components are being challenged.However, China and the USA have things in common. For example, as Chinese cities in the east are more modernised and glittery compared to cities in the western parts of China, so is the American landscape made up of different urban appearances. There are enormous differences between cities like New York, and other cities in the American mid-west such as Columbus and Indianapolis. As Chongqing is so different to Shanghai, so is New York different to Indianapolis.SingaporeThere is nothing wrong with a country showcasing its wealth and prosperity. However, perhaps Singapore is a great example in which one of the world’s most successful (not largest) economies, has not allocated resources so much into skyscrapers, but rather focused on quality of lifestyle.Here’s the significance of comparing Singapore, to China and the USA. Singapore is predominantly Chinese (around 70%), yet it doesn’t have skyscrapers everywhere. So while it’s true that some Chinese cities look more advanced than their American counterparts, I would argue that the Chinese don’t just focus on appearances, but they can also create a successful balance between appearance and quality of lifestyle. In other words, in Singapore, prosperity is more understated and subtle, yet is still apparent everywhere you look.Example, Singapore possesses some of the world's most expensive buildings, such as the three-towered Marina Bay Sands which includes a stunning concert hall and museum. How about the Singapore F1 Grand Prix? Hardly a skyscraper, but this global annual event showcases Singaporean (and Chinese) ingenuity. Moreover, this island country has one of the lowest crime rates in the world and one of the highest GDP per capita. Singapore is a stunning global template, highlighting that the Chinese do not focus only on appearance, but on an amazing hybrid urban model in which east meets west, resulting in stunning outcomes. More information can be found at… rod_pallister@yahoo.co.ukEducationHere’s another point which I know some readers will disagree with, but here goes…America’s Ivy League universities are famous, yet there have been reports of bias in terms of student selection. For example, there were media reports (including The New York Times and The Washington Post), of lower numbers of Asian students being admitted into an Ivy League university due to bias Asian-Americans Suing Harvard Say Admissions Files Show Discrimination.Why?Affirmative action! According to other reports, you have the scenario in which Asian students with SAT scores up to 150 points higher than other foreign students, being sidelined in favor of more disadvantaged foreign students.While these Ivy League universities are still rated at the top of the QS World University Rankings, QS World University Rankings 2019, the University of Singapore (NUS) and Nanyang Technological University (NTU) are already ranked 10th and 11th respectively. How about this… Tsinghua University in mainland China is already ranked 17th in these rankings. I predict that as US Ivy League universities become increasingly subjected to public scrutiny, Asian universities will continue to creep higher up the academia landscape. The 2 aforementioned Singaporean universities don’t care much about political correctness, rather they care about academic excellence. Should PhD and Masters students require further information, or help with their studies, check out… PhD Thesis Writing Service | PhD Thesis Help & Proofreading. Essentially, it’s not about appearance, it’s about performance.How about this…In the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) ranking for 2015, Singapore is leading the world in math, reading and science. The USA doesn’t even feature in the top 10! Hong Kong and China are not far behind; they are fast catching up. So I would ask a sub-question… “Does having the largest economy translate into the best appearance in terms of infrastructure, and the highest quality of education and lifestyles?”It obviously doesn’t.This is not to say that China doesn’t have challenges within their own education system, see Rod Pallister's answer to Living Abroad: What is it like for a Chinese student to pursue a PhD in Europe? However, the Chinese are diligently showcasing their rapid economic growth, they are also focusing on educating their youth, and on improving the quality of life. While the USA are obviously not showcasing their slower economic growth, are they focusing on academic excellence and quality of lifestyle?So, why doesn’t the USA look like the largest economy in the world when you travel there? In my opinion, the US has forgotten about tomorrow, and forgot about investing in it’s youth. It’s simply fighting numerous battles defending the world’s largest economy; this while China focuses on the future. When I was living and teaching in China a few years ago, I noticed (in Fuling, near Chongqing) that ten 40-storey apartment blocks had just been built (at breakneck speed), and yet only one was inhabited. Upon asking why the other 9 were empty, the answer said it all… “they will be full in 5–10 years time”.I rest my case…It’s not about today, it’s about our future.",17,0.1286317507628983,0.38705379320133426,0.8469875415748747
169,"A few reasons.Much of China’s modern urban infrastructure is brand new. There are cities near Hong Kong and Macau that didn’t even exist before 1997. So, like Dubai, they can look all fresh and shiny.Whereas New York and Boston and Philadelphia were built in the 17th century. Downtown Chicago has been revitalized under Dailey the Younger, and has lots of glimmering new skyscrapers. Miami also has many modern business towers.Also, the Chinese are trying purposefully to impress the world, show that they are now Playahs on the Big Stage, not rice farmers in funny triangular hats. There is a lot of government subsidy involved. Whereas in America, if it’s not profitable, the 1 percent isn’t going to build it, they’ll just buy a fancier yacht and a faster exoticar.Finally, China is not in denial about global warming, so they are investing heavily in state-of-the-art public transportation, their most popular car has a Segway built into the trunk, so you can park a few miles from downtown, then Segway the rest of the way, etc. West of the Mississippi, there is really pathetic public transportation infrastructure, and in Red States, there are actually laws against building it — because The Koch Brothers and Mobil Exxon bribe their legislators to rely on oil and gas and coal only. So even in out more recently built cities, they encourage sprawl and smog and 14-mpg SUVs over anything resembling innovation.That being said, the average Chinese worker probably has no shot at a 3.5-BR split-level with a built-in garage, finished basement, and 1/4-acre plot out back, so part of America’s economic wealth is simply spent differently.",51,0.05785123966942149,0.32869605142332414,0.7799741861898619

I can not reveal them but I want to prevent the unhumble impression potentially impact to ordinary Chinese.Instead of such “obviously arrogant” question, the ordinary opinion spreading in Chinese is: we are far behind and will definitely keep learning from US, UK, Japan, Canada (and you name it) in many terms.We are developing our cities that USA, Japan or Europe have did decades/century earlier. Certainly, nowadays we can build Chinese cities more efficiently by the late-developing advantages from modern technology advancement. But also majority of Chinese know exactly what status we are and problems we possessing, such as high density and unbalanced distribution of population, wide and unenlightened rural areas acquiring from long-term agricultural culture, pollution from low level industry, bureaucracy.All above is an average opinion what I got from Chinese whoever openmind students studying abroad and high patriotic seniors living in the most undeveloped far wested region of China.

171,"There is are many versions of the same question on Quora. The thing is, this is simple…China’s new infrastructure was mostly built in the 1990s and 2000s, Japan’s was built in the 1970s and 1980s. South Korea was in the 1980s and 1990s.America was a developed nation long before these times so the infrastructure is older.In you never had the infrastructure or it was destroyed in warfare, that is different from a nation that has been stable and had similar infrastructure for decades.For example, South Korea has the one of the fastest WIFI networks on earth, but it was only put in place relatively recently.America invented the internet, and used existing infrastructure to initially roll it out, and built a few additional supports, but there is a huge cost that needs to be justified to completely rip up existing working infrastructure (billions of USD), but the infrastructure is working about 80% as good as the new one will work. Do you justify billions of dollars expenditure to get a 20% gain? Many people will say “no”.In 50 years some places like India will have the new and greatest stuff, and then the OP will be asking why is Japan and South Korea so old compared to India.It will be for the same reason.Also it depends on what infrastructure you are talking about and where.In my experiences going to rural China, American rural areas usually have much superior infrastructure.If you are talking about Shanghai compared to New York or Shenzhen compared to a similar sized city, well Shanghai was really built up only very recently, and Shenzhen was a small village as late as the 1980s. All there stuff is band new, built from scratch.",32,0.1380519480519481,0.4256493506493506,0.30660745594550615

174,"Beforehand, the term disruptive can be both good and bad. For instance, good for the industry, especially consumers but bad for the incumbents.Now, does any China’s investment may disrupt the domestic economy?I believe the answer is both No and Yes.No on the macro, but might be Yes for the micro scale.The micro side talks about how it will impact some certain industries, their players and existing structures, such as supply chain, sourcing, work force, profit margin, etc.For example, lately, I see that a Chinese car manufacturer has been investing heavily in Indonesia. If they can maintain their products and pricing for the foreseeable time, this investment may have a disruptive impact on the car industry whose largest chunk of market share is currently controlled by Japanese brands.The good disruptive is consumers may then be able to purchase better quality cars at a much more affordable pricing. The negative disruptive? The incumbent players who own the Japanese brands will loose some of their market share.Since the car industry, i.e., total sales, work force, etc., as the whole does not shrink then this investment will not disrupt the overall automotive industry output.The same can be said for other industries, thus I believe on the micro side, it may disrupt the domestic economy, but not on the overall macro economy.I, for one, even believe the investments in infrastructure will benefit Indonesia’s economy in the long run, regardless of the country of origin of the invesment.Thank you for asking.",2,0.07456422887457372,0.4223790577238854,0.9933710138311819

177,"Because that is factually incorrect.According to statistics from the World Bank, the proportion of China's population living on less than $1.25/day is estimated to be 13.1% in 2008, meaning that there were still roughly 170 million Chinese people living in absolute poverty.According to the Chinese official statistics, in 2014, 7.2% of the Chinese population[1] live below the national poverty line (about 400 USD annual net income per capital[2] ). As of 2018, the number of people in poverty living below the national poverty line is around 30 million, approximately 2% of the entire population[3] . Given that China has a total population of 1.4 billion, the absolute number of impoverished people is still quite high.As we know, China has very large income disparities between urban and rural residents. With regards to household consumption, the Gini measure of inequality of China is close to 0.6[4] (from Southwestern University of Finance and Economics, Peking University’s estimated value is 0.71 but seems not quite convincing). In some rural areas, many people are still living from hand to mouth, their living conditions can be extremely poor.I assume that most people on this site have zero idea about how poor some Chinese rural regions can be, so let’s search some random pictures from Chinese search engine Baidu.Below are the results from the keywords “countryside in Henan province” (North China):The results from keywords “countryside in Sichuan province” (South China):I have verified that all of the above pictures were taken in the last 5 years.To avoid creating unnecessary misunderstandings and confusions, it is important to note that I am not saying all of the Chinese rural areas look like the above pictures, because they are obvious the poorest households in China and don't necessarily reflect the average standards of living.I have created a news feed that grabs all kinds of reports about China, each years, I am able to find dozens of suicide cases or accidents occur due to extreme poverty.Of course I shall be more than happy to hear of that if China is really home to none of the poorest 10% of humans, but from time to time the brutal reality killed my dream.Footnotes[1] 改革开放以来农村贫困人口减少7亿_央广网[2] 国务院扶贫办：我国现行贫困标准已高于世行标准-新华网[3] 2017年末我国农村贫困人口减少到3046万人-新华网[4] 西南财大再发报告:中国基尼系数0.61高于世界平均水平_中国经济网――国家经济门户",87,0.02670391623879997,0.42245293466223693,0.7895241935713412

191,"Do they really think they are the superior race? Not to my knowledge. At least nowadays, the Europeans are humble (or hypocritical) enough not to claim racial superiority openingly. I only know the Germans under Hitler once did boast they were the master race. But this is history. By virtue of human history in the last few hundred years, however, I have to concede that, the Europeans, especially the Anglo-Saxons and the Slavs, have been and still are two dominating peoples in terms of achievements in all fields: economy, science and technology, military strength etc, and last but not least, land mass and natural resource occupation.Let us have a quick look at land mass occupation:Total area of land on earth: 148.326 million km²United States of America/Area: 9.834 million km²Australia/Area: 7.692 million km²New Zealand/Area: 0.268 million km²Canada/Area: 9.985 million km²British Isles/Area: 0.315 million km²Russia/Area: 17.100 million km²__________________Total: 45.094 million km²45.094/148.326 = 0.304 ~ 30%Therefore, we can see that the English-speaking Anglo-Saxons and the Slavs (not counting the non-Russian Slavs) alone occupy 30% of earth's landmass. But they constitute only 7.9% (Anglo-Saxons plus Russian Slavs = 604 million divided by world population = 7.6 billion gives 7.9%) of total world population ! And the majority of land occupied by Europeans were relatively recently acquired, either by theft, swindle or plain brute force, often resulting in genocide of the original sons of the soil. Similar ""grand exploits"" by the Europeans took place in North America, Australia and maybe in Russian Siberia. The New Zealand natives, the Maori, might well be the lucky exception with their Treaty of Waitangi.So, comparing with the tremendous feats by the Europeans in the last few hundred years in land-grabbing and resource plundering all over the world, what is so grand about China, which up till today has to grapple with the West and especially Trump on issues of its sovereignty over Taiwan, the South China Sea, Tibet and Xinjiang?

192,"Europeans at this time did not know much about China for one. Mainly this type of racism began in the Middle Ages, and was at first largely about religious interactions. The immensely powerful Muslim empires the the East of Europe were the only contact Europeans had with other regions, aside from places like Russia and Scandinavia. With Islam condemned as Heathens by the Catholic and Orthodox churches, people began to associate darker skin with sin. Christian texts from this time even said that the reason the Arab’s skin was so dark was because of their sins. This belief of non-whites being inferior was grown during the Renaissance when the innovations in technology gave Europe an advantage over much of the world.

194,"As a general question I would answer that Europe is a historical artifact that played a role once, but this potential was squandered by self destruction, and it lost that potential roll. Thus we must accept a increasingly more insignificant Europe. That is if current trends continue.However, Europe has a very important role to play in the constructions of a new world order that is evolving currently. The US is the leader. China is a very aggressive challenger for the No 1 spot. Apparently size of GDP equals world leader. Thus the world is potentially entering into a phase of great political instability and even greater economic chaos. What is needed is a third World power to balance this potential instability that could be created by a two leaders scenario. The three leader scenario is apparently the most stable arrangement one can find in politics. Even Socrates speculated that a 3 leadership configuration will be the most stable situation one could hope for. Thus it is of critical importance that we, the world find a third leader and soon.I see Europe can fulfill this role. But you need the British back in that system, and even perhaps Russia. This will make them a formidable force, and a very able third power. Although I myself snicker at this idea, it is of the utmost importance that we create the right political structure for a peaceful world. Thinking about it in theory, then it seems quite possible, but in practical terms it may be somewhat of a challenge.So in short, Europe has a very important role to play in creating a future stable world, but can they form the structures required to House the diversity of Europe within it, to become a realistic third world power. We all have a role to play in this regard.There is another option as a third world political power but I believe the inequalities between the people of that potential region are to large and there is little hope to get a functional arrangement implemented in that area. Maybe 10 years from now they could a better option than the current Europe.If we can act now, we could prevent finding ourselves in a very hopeless position in the near future.",2,0.1457723978919631,0.43618835874270656,0.9539587574114978
195,"Where did you get those numbers from? I highly doubt if the CCP China ever becomes the world’s largest economy. Yes it is possible that someday the CCP claims to be bigger than the US, but that’s not the whole truth.First, China’s GDP numbers are not even close to accurate. They may have been before 2008, but after that they haven’t. No one really knows what the actual growth rate is, but according to experts, it is safe to say that it’s much lower than reported. Estimated growth rate is around 2–4%.Secondly, the CCP is facing huge problems. These kind of problems are slowing GDP growth, corruption, pollution, water shortage, fake unstable stock market, housing bubble, trade war with the US, unprofitable SOEs, skyrocketing debt, shadow banking and increasing political instability due to all those listed above. So I don’t think China as its current form is capable to become the world’s largest economy. At least for long. Of course when the CCP collapses, it will be a whole another story.But the question was: What role will Europe play in the world?Answer: A big role. The EU is the world’s largest economy with $21 trillion GDP. The US is around $20 trillion. The EU and European companies will continue to play a very important role still for a long time.Plus since European countries hopefully start getting closer to each other, the EU could gain a lot of power.",1,0.09346153846153848,0.43551282051282053,0.6443621447757018

202,"With quite a few friends on both side of the Strait, I found that the Singaporean in general view the rise of China with some degree of hostility. This may be a reflection of their world view and national policy, Singapore flourish and integrated deeply into the current world order which the American had created following the end of the WWII and the Cold War. The order and stability that the west had brought, for the most part, had been used to the fullest by this tiny city state who risen to become one of the richest and most prominent nation on earth. China did more than just rock the boat, they want to create their own version of world order which run in contrast to every thing the west stand for, from creating fact on the ground to manipulate the law for their own end to outright threaten to use military action as the mean to extend their influence and power. While the American is not exactly above that either, their dedication and intensity is very different to what the current China.Malaysian Chinese, on the other hands, seem to welcome the rise of China with open arm. To some degree I feel that their sentiment had been very similar to the Thai Chinese view here but for a very different reason. Malaysia Chinese is an ethnic minority within their own country and is boderline (if not outright) discriminate by their very own government who enacted many measures against their prosperity and rise to power. Perhaps there is also a religion element in the mix as well, as many Malaysian Chinese are Christian, which make them a double minority in Malaysia.When I went to the country, both East and West, I was totally surprised by how much resentment they held toward their own country and their own government. I literally never find a single Chinese Malaysia who did not hold some kind of grudge toward the Malay for all the suffering and injustice they have to live through (except online which I found a whopping.. 1 person.. who did not hold such view.)Because of this reason, many of the Malaysian Chinese saw the rise of China and the breaking of the current order like a ray of hope. They are very welcoming toward nearly every China actions and regard many of their method as necessary for China to rise against the west and breaking down the status quo which doesn’t bring them justice.Bonus info: I found it pretty intersting that Thai Chinese seem to be somewhat of a bridge between the two extreme view from our souther neighbour.Like Malaysia, Thai Chinese in general welcome the rise of China with open arm. Unlike Malaysia however, this view does not come from the resentment to the government. In fact, more like the Singaporean Chinese, Thai Chinese positive view toward China is in full concert with the government policy who also seek the closer relationship with our big, northern neighbour. Chinese in Thailand has been treated very well, above and beyond what necessary by the Thai community, as such Thai Chinese tend to be among the most patriotic citizen - especially to Thailand but also to China (since the govt. does support it.)I still remeber the awkward look from one of my mom friend who was a CPC officials, when he saw my dad group of friends sung Chinese patriotic song with such passion amd whisper to us that “in China, not even the CPC members are this passionate about our nation”*noted that this is many years before the nationalism sentiment is taking over all over the country.But the same reason is also why I was so shocked when I see such resentment many of my Malaysian friend held toward their country. I am no nationalist, in fact I despite nationalism that make people hate other people just from the basic of nation and race. But to have such a strong feeling with borderline hatred toward their host country is also unthinkable for me and perhaps many of my peers due to the very different background we have here.",27,0.11671179967375617,0.46961372263002693,0.9969096624753969
203,"I have been traveling frequently to both countries, especially SINGAPORE, and I have many friends on both sides. Here are some of my observations.Generally I do find Malaysian Chinese are much easier to get along with and usually have a much better command of Chinese, while Singaporean Chinese are more reserved and are usually poor in Chinese, some do better with speaking but not writing and reading.Malaysian Chinese have been dedicated to preserve their cultural identity and heritage, and in Penang, almost all the Chinese restaurants I go in, there are donation box for local Chinese schools. I heard many stories on how local Chinese community fought the government’s restraint orders to keep their Chinese schools and make sure their kids could have proper Chinese education, even when the diploma from Chinese schools were not acknowledged in Malaysia at that time. The unity and strong sense of community is really impressive, partly because Chinese had been oppressed, discriminated and considered as threat by Malay government, and the community provides support both material and spiritual. In short, Malaysia Chinese identify more with their Chinese heritage and they embrace everything that makes China stronger.While Singapore is different, people would usually believe since Chinese is majority, which will make SINGAPORE more friendly with China. It was not the case at all. Singapore is more western than it is oriental, the Chinese here are somehow “refined and modified” , that helped SINGAPORE become a hub linking west and east in the early days, taking advantage of its English education and legal system, but it also alienated their Chinese identity. Many Singaporean Chinese actually identify more with the West than with China, and people are proud to study in English schools as good command of English would help land a good job after graduation. For quite some time, Chinese government sent government delegations and hoped to learn from Singapore in its meritocracy government operation, its social welfare system among others. That must have made Singaporean proud and somehow thought they are the ones to make what China is today. Of course it is not true.With the rise of China, Singapore found it in direct completion with China in many areas, and China’s dependence on Singapore has been much less compared with early days of its reform. My Singapore colleague later told me, before he came to China, he still thought he had lots of advantage. His fantasy collapsed when he found his Chinese colleagues are also good in English, know Chinese market better and of course speak a much better Chinese. It somehow made him wonder what specifically he could contribute and add value if apparently Chinese could do the job pretty well without him. What about those Singaporeans who never come to China or their impression of China were still stuck decades ago? It must have made SINGAPORE irritated, confused and worried, and the fact that it bonded with US to conduct some offshore balance actually intensified the mistrust from the China side, as the containment of China and alliance with US militarily is to the best interest of Singapore, while China’s end game is to flush US out of APAC. Under that framework it is only natural for Singaporean Chinese have a more or less complex attitude towards China, in fact I would not call it hostile, it is more of mixture of jealousy, resentment, suspicion and opportunistic expectations",61,0.15902777777777774,0.2875661375661376,0.996532014691654

211,"Do you think Trump could cause a trade war with China?The short answer is no, unless industry and the financial markets commit to a pact of economic suicide with Trump.In “The Art of War,” Sun Tzu states that ""Every battle is won or lost before it's ever fought"". Détente was used during the cold war for easing strained relations, especially, in using the threat of a pre-empty attack. Today, a battle space has many dimensions which now include cyberspace. The defensive plan may not survive first contact with an adversary, but the general staff will quickly formulates a new plan and adapt making the evolving plan a part of the plan as the pieces move before the actual battle begins. In this scenario, it would be foolish to predict the outcome of a battle where the enemy is fully committed to fight back in any way they can and with whatever resources they muster together. China today is not an underdog to be bullied.A report last week states that China’s government is contemplating reducing its purchases of U.S. treasury bonds and briefly rattled financial markets. Against the tensions between the two countries, it was widely understood as a warning that aggressive American action on trade might jeopardize the willingness of China to subsidize the drunken spending of the U.S. government.China is now, and has been for a decade, the largest foreign buyer of U.S. treasury debt, with Japan being a close second. The Chinese central bank has halted new purchases and sold old holdings, each time the Trump administration rattles noise about China, which triggers concerns in U.S. economic circles that a new and dangerous era for U.S.-China relations is about to begin.Expectations of an eventual conflict, hot or cold, are widespread, from defense policy analyst to Harvard professor Graham Allison who explains that a “Thucydides trap” ""What made war inevitable was the growth of Athenian power and the fear which this caused in Sparta."" Edward Wong in a recent essay wrote: China’s “Communist Party embraces hard power and coercion, and this could well be what replaces the fading liberal hegemony of the United States on the global stage. It will not lead to a grand vision of world order. Instead, before us looms a void.”Moreover, as the Trump administration threatens to withdraw aid from countries ranging from the NATO alliance to Pakistan, China has begun a $1 trillion effort to underwrite the void. As Washington turns away from trade deals such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), Beijing has been quietly filling the space with regional partners, such as Vietnam, that might prefer the United States as their primary economic partner but are left with China as a result of the American retreat.China’s foreign currency reserves now stand at more than $3 trillion. In contrast, the U.S. has foreign exchange reserves that hover at around $120 billion. Trump’s tariffs would automatically trigger penalties against the U.S. in the World Trade Organization (WTO), and might even lead to serious disruption of WTO’s years of negotiating or total collapse, which would inevitably lead to higher world tariffs against U.S. exports. Even if it doesn’t take place immediately the sense of turmoil to come would be enough to trigger dire uncertainty for American business and employment. China, on the other hand with a centralized party government system has a better probability of surviving the hard blow of global trade disruptions.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross made clear that the White House intends to scale up its fight over intellectual property theft. If the U.S. continues to escalate its trade actions against China, experts say retaliation is likely to occur most probably where the U.S. is weakest-- its foreign debt and agriculture.High tariff carry the potential of painful risks to U.S. agriculture mainly in states where it is the biggest industry of the Midwest, like Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, Indiana and Missouri which are in the heartland of Trump supporters.",14,0.026467051467051476,0.4011423761423761,0.7862846332048512

216,"Anyone who reads business news on a regular basis like I do will know that there are lots of news about and from Japan.The difference is that Japan tends not to have controversial news.Unfortunately, when it does have controversial news, it rocks people to the very core — such as news of horrific murders of schoolchildren by other schoolchildren or some lover beheading and then cannabalising his/her mate. Fortunately, those incidents are rare.The reason for the apparent general lack of controversies in Japanese life comes from their reputation of being a very cohesive society.I’ve lived three years in Tokyo and it’s hard to miss the running thread in Japanese life of not rocking the boat. Private (or non-public) matters are strictly kept behind the scenes.Anonymity is an established part of Japanese news media culture — many Japanese newspapers have no bylines because of the idea that the news outlet has collective responsibility over any news item. Sources speaking on condition of anonymity do remain anonymous and the journalists nearly always operate to respect that assurance.The law also makes controversies somewhat harder to arise.For instance, class-action type of lawsuits are uncommon in Japan. The law there actually allows them but in the status as “collective redress actions” and not as full-blown class actions like in the West. They’re uncommon because, prior to 2016 or so, such collective actions must obtain the prior consent of the Prime Minister’s Office or some other ministerial consent before going ahead. That limits the kind of controversial actions from being launched — and therefore limits the news coverage.Another example is divorce. While the divorce rate is on the rise in Japan, it’s still a somewhat low occurrence. That’s because the Japanese divorce laws have NO framework for child custody or parental visitation rights. By default, whoever initiates the divorce action gets child custody and the other party practically gets nothing (except the obligation for child support). So most people simply forgo getting a divorce and rather live separately and work out their own arrangements. That makes for little or no controversial news about this kind of marital situations.",29,0.113590169992609,0.4591642097739659,0.8258773572659783

233,"In my opinion, not much.One of the key drivers for Malaysian parents sending their children to international schools is for them to study in English. If it was Chinese language proficiency that the parents wanted for their children, there are the Chinese Independent High Schools available, and which probably cost a lot less compared to the likes of Garden International School. China already recognises the UEC Certificate and SPM Chinese to exempt Malaysian students from having to take the HSK Chinese Proficiency Test for entry into Chinese universities.Now, one might postulate the theory that China’s rise is so phenomenal that it totally overtakes the West, causing the Chinese language to dominate over English. While that is not entirely impossible, I would say that for the foreseeable future, it is rather unlikely that China’s rise would necessarily result in a ripple in Malaysia’s international school scene.I know where you are getting at with your question: Will the rise of China result in China International Schools mushrooming across the country? Again, I do not foresee that happening in the near future. China’s rise must be strong enough to create a correspondingly strong-enough economic incentive for China’s premier schools such as the Shanghai High School to set up shop in Malaysia. And there has to be a demand for China’s syllabus, one that parents are willing to choose and pay for in preference to sending their children to English-based international schools or the existing Chinese Independent High Schools.There is only one key factor that I can think of that would tip the balance in that favour - if and when China’s education system reaches a point where it is truly internationally recognised and preferred over Western education systems, e.g. G.C.E., International Baccalaureate, the various Australian and Canadian pre-university programmes, etc. To be honest, China’s education system boasts a very high standard, particularly in the areas of Mathematics and Science. The problem is that there is still a prevalent mindset that “West is Best” (not saying that it is wrong, and no offence meant to the West). Schools in the U.S. are warming up the Singapore’s mathematics education methods, so there is every possibility that China’s education system may be next, if it can be seen to have broken free of the shackles of an overly-examination-oriented system. But again, there are too many steps and factors in between for a rise in China today to equate with a mushrooming of China International Schools in Malaysia.The other thing is the general apathy of Chinese Malaysian parents towards fluency in the Chinese language. As much as many Chinese Malaysian parents today wax lyrical about sending their children to Chinese primary schools “to build them fluency in their mother tongue”, deep-down inside, all they want is for their children to achieve a smattering ability in speaking and reading. Now, that is a real shame, because the standard of Chinese language education in Malaysia as it stands now is very high - probably high enough not to urgently require the introduction of China’s system to prop it up (well, there are elements that could be improved upon, but we are certainly much further ahead compared to many, many other countries). If there was a sufficiently-high number of Chinese primary school students who chose to continue studying Chinese all the way to SPM (Form V) and not drop the subject just because it was so darn difficult to score an ‘A’ for, we would have a pretty large population of students educated to a level where their Chinese language skills could just about go neck-to-neck with their China counterparts (Malaysia’s SPM Chinese is probably about the equivalent of HSK5 or even 6). Now, if parents are not even hot on the idea of persuading their children to study Chinese till Form V, what then are the odds that they would pay a premium to park their children in a Chinese International School?At best, what might happen is that the existing international schools might catch on and start rolling out Chinese language as a subject taught (and some already have it in place). But frankly, such a programme will not come close to reaching the standard of Chinese taught in the Chinese primary schools today, where students are fully-immersed in the language in almost every subject and every aspect of school life.",3,0.08283991894630194,0.3151691995947315,0.9974162437491031

235,"China too, like us aspires to become a global economy. The way we our worried about our economy, similarly they are. They want to be the centre of power in South Asia. This is clearly evident from the attitude they now have on the Indian border, South China Sea & towards Japan.They want to show the world that the dragon has come and everyone needs to accept the authority. No doubt, the dragon is certainly a new rising economic power and has left far behind the other developing economies of the world. They want to be a dominant power in South Asia.

In examples like these, when it comes to a trade war, the ""hardship tolerance"" of the spoiled Americans will definitely be lower than the average Chinese, whose ""hardship tolerance"" is already deeply ingrained in their genes by the Century of Humiliation. So my guess is, in a real trade war, the spoiled Americans will break before the Chinese, and much earlier.Secondly, the last time I checked, the average American household simply cannot ""live"" a day without recourse to something Chinese-made. Simply, the US doesn't make many things for daily use nowadays, from toothbrush to PC, or their products will cost a bomb compared to Chinese ones. And they usually don't buy Indian products even if they are cheap. So, how long can the spoiled Americans bear this kind of inconvenience, or even hardship? Not too long, I suppose.Thirdly, the world knows that Trump himself had business deals in China through the Trump Organization. China also granted Trump a portfolio of valuable trademarks shortly after he was elected. Being a shrewd businessman that he is, would anybody be so sure that Trump wouldn't think twice about an all-out trade war between the US and China?? Furthermore, China just last May awarded his daughter Ivanka seven new trademarks across a broad collection of businesses, including books, housewares and cushions. Would he not think twice for the sake of the Trump family business, being a shrewd businessman that he is? I am not so sure, as, at around the same time that Ivanka won seven new trademarks from China, President Trump vowed to find a way to prevent a major Chinese telecommunications company, TZE, from going bust. Could this be a pure coincidence? Only fools would believe !Therefore, in conclusion, I would say the US, or more correctly Trump will compromise before Xi Jinping would even bat an eye !",28,0.08258953168044077,0.3696205562114653,0.8162031585668279
257,"In the very short term, it would actually mean a very large increase to the US cost of living as suddenly most everyday stuff got a ton more expensive. especially damaging to families / people that’s barely getting by.The companies in the US would try to adjust and find other sources, though it’s not obvious that the rest of the world can take up that capacity in a hurry, there’s going to be a few years at least where the living standard goes way down in the US and then maybbeee it’ll start to come back up. Many companies would not survive the process but some new ones would probably reemerge to replace them.For China, it would be a problem for sure, but net export has been increasingly a smaller part of their GDP for awhile already for awhile now (it’s now something more like 4% when it use to be more like 9%)We should also note that a very large portion of the “export” from China is actually US companies making stuff and shipping it back, these companies would be in the cross fire pretty soon once it becomes apparent a real trade war is happening. Given that this is only likely to happen with a total break down of communications between the sides, it’s very plausible that both sides just confiscate all assets of the other side’s company in their territory and kick them out.I don’t know if it’ll bankrupt China, but I do know it’ll almost certainly bankrupt Apple if that happens.China has run autarky style system before, in fact, well within living memory, it could shift it’s production in that direction pretty reasonably fast, helps that they still control a ton of state companies. The problems it’ll create could largely be alleviated by playing the Nationalism card.It’s quite probable these would have a lot of dangerous second order domino effects, the PRC would almost certainly shut down it’s financial market pretty quickly after this to prevent capital outflow, this would lead to a large exodus of expats in China and they might even just straight up expel them. which would lead to similar retaliation in the US and cries for a new Chinese exclusion act would almost certainly happen. which would shake a lot of fundamental core values of the US.China is already quite connected with the world, the most dangerous second order effect this could potentially lead to is that the rest of the world start to formulate a system independent of the US dollars, and when that happens the US would either have major major problems or the far more likely outcome of resorting to open military threats to force other countries to close itself to China as well, afterall, the US’s true material advantage is that it’s military outweighs the rest of the world combined. If we’re down this path already it’s inevitable the US would use that to leverage itself a lot more blatantly.None of this could lead to any sort of good outcome, once we’re down this path, even if the CCP collapse for some reason, the end result would unlikely be some sort of democratic China and flowers and butterflies again. We’d either have a even more hawkish China or a totally collapsed China with massive humanitarian crisis.

258,"Win the trade war, China has the confidence(translated by google :)If the domestic economy can be measured as unscrupulous, the trade war will inevitably lead to both losses and no winners. Under this circumstance, the so-called ""winning"" trade war is actually a relative concept, that is, the overall economic strength of the country can still maintain a relative rise under the impact of the trade war, the development process will not be disrupted by the trade war, and the long-term strategic goal is not due to trade. The battle could not be achieved.Judging from these three points, China can win in the trade war.One is the ""day time."" Economic globalization is an irresistible historical tide. China is fighting, relying on the laws of the market and the trend of world economic development, and safeguarding the common interests of mankind. This laid the foundation for winning the trade war.At present, the practice of putting pressure on tariffs everywhere in the United States has caused growing international dissatisfaction. A joint force against trade protectionism and unilateralism is taking shape. In response to the United States' tariffs on imported steel and aluminum products, the EU, Canada, and Russia all have strong counter-measures; more than 40 economies, including traditional American allies such as Japan and the European Union, have protested against the US threat to impose a tariff on cars; The BRIC’s eighth meeting of economic and trade ministers also issued a separate statement in support of the multilateral trading system.The second is to have ""land advantage."" The unique advantages of the Chinese economy provide favorable conditions for winning the trade war.Consumption has now become the first driving force for China’s economic growth. As the world's second largest economy, the Chinese market is vast, with middle-income groups having the largest number of people in the world, and the group is growing stronger as the economy grows steadily.At the same time, China has the largest manufacturing industry in the world and the only country in the world with all the industrial categories in the UN industry classification. The potential of domestic demand and a complete and complete industrial chain are important sources of China's competitiveness. It also means that the Chinese economy has a strong ability to withstand external shocks and there is plenty of room for vacillation.The third is that there is ""human harmony."" This is a significant difference between China and the United States.Faced with the largest trade war in the history of the economy, there are many differences among different interest groups within the United States. Relevant industry associations and many scholars have expressed strong opposition to their government practices. In China, the leadership core is strong and the government functions are functioning efficiently. The public is highly consistent in resolutely countering US unilateralism, protectionist practices, and defending national interests.Moral support from many, scant support. With the passage of time, China, which occupies the ""time, place, and people"", will become more prominent, and the United States will accelerate the loss of people's hearts. This is precisely the basic reason and emboldenedness of China's courage to fight and win.",3,0.2039650537634409,0.41102150537634413,0.8255557135085818

A 300% tariff would hurt China but China’s economy doesn’t rely on exports and Chinese businesses have PLENTY of other trading partners.(Credit to Albert for this analysis.)If anything, such a move will continue to isolate the United States from some of the wealthiest and most powerful countries in the world, while also harming domestic businesses that rely on access to Chinese markets or need Chinese material and labor to turn a profit and therefore put money back to the United States economy. And of course, the workers are really the only people who get hurt in the end.

262,"China still trades with other countries. Although it's economy will take a hit, it has other options available. Depending on how long those tariffs are enacted, it will either damage or cripple China's economy as it looks today.But the US would not go unscathed. The strongest card that China has on the US is that it buys it's debt. It's the largest net buyer of US bonds and certainly helped the American economy somewhat out of the Great Recession. So if the US did put those trade blocks on to that level the Chinese would no longer buy that debt every month. In fact they could start selling it very rapidly and manipulate the bond market.Im not sure what the effects of that would be as, as far as I know, there is no circumstance in history that is comparable to this theoretical possibility in terms of scale.What I can imagine is that the bond rate would drop I assume, due to the massively influx of supply. It would crush the US' ideas of raising interest rates.Putting those kinds of tariffs in would also backfire on the US economy at home anyway. A much faster rate of inflation for one. Far less FDI.The stock market in both countries may quickly deteriorate.Would 'Big Brother' fall? Remember that to achieve power dozens of millions of people died. I doubt simple trade barriers could collapse it. However tariffs of that percentage and widespread use may warrant hostile action. Especially if the Chinese government feels it needs a scapegoat, if for example the situation became dire and there was some social unrest.As a side note, Europe would be the key to figuring out who 'won' such a situation.

266,"China’s political system is highly centralized, arguably most centralized system on earth given the size. Highly centralized political system is inherently more fragile than non-centralized one, as decapitation will have much more severe consequences. Further, there is always danger that policy made from the top doesn’t necessarily reflect the need of the bottom, or that by the time policy reached to the bottom, it has twisted beyond recognition and hurt the very people central government trying to help.China choose not to genocide their way out of their national unity. When times are good, people of different ethnicity get along fine. But it is also potential fault line for foreign States to exploit. Soviet (Uyghurs/Mongolian) , Britain/US (Tibet) all took advantage of such ethnic fault lines in the past when China was weak. I have argued that may be China should of genocide their way to national unity like the way Canada/Australia/United States did to remove these potential fault lines which foreign power will take advantage of when opportunity arises. Notice that I use a very broad definition of “genocide” here, which includes the “stolen generation” policy implemented in Canada/Australia/US until 1970s.Because such ethnic fault lines exist and that each minority ethnic group is large in absolute number, China inherently has more internal strife than other nations.China has a long history, 2300 of centralized rule. And China has seen collapse at regular basis (on average, every ~300 years or so when times are good). United States, on the other hand, only has a short history of a single regime. It is inconceivable to separate US identity from current US regime. Because US regime collapse is hard to imagine, people don’t talk about it much.Most importantly, China is a ruled by a Communist regime. In most American’s eye, all communist regimes are the same. So, if Soviet collapsed, then, Chinese Communist regime SHOULD collapse too.Much of US’ dismay lies upon the fact that China has so far defies American’s expectation. Instead of take a close look at what Chinese Communist Party did differently compare to the Soviet, pundits talk about the China’s collapse all the time.In short, China is ruled by a Communist regime (which people associate with collapse of the Soviet Union), and Chinese regime collapsed in the past thus is relatively easy to imagine. US regime, on the other hand, is much more difficult to imagine simply because it never collapse before within its relatively short history.",221,0.07122780468119452,0.45276564537157765,0.8403002243502511
267,"People are always thinking of the collapsed of China and compare it with the collapsed of the USSR., because they are both communist and evil. The approach to analyze the collapsed must be taken from a different angle. The fighting spirit of development in a society is important for the growth or the collapsed of the society.Lets analyse:There is a big difference in the two communist systems of China and the USSR and most importantly in the fighting spirit of the population in the 2 countries. First of all the roots of Chinese communist system is their farmers, that has been exploited for millenniums by their credit system. They want to be developed and are ready to fight and sacrifice anything and everything to reach their goal. The Chinese system tried in the beginning to industrialized these farmers group following the USSR system ,but failed miserably. They left this failed approach and industrialized the cities in the coastal areas of the country. This approach is successful because the dormant entrepreneurial spirit of the Chinese people became active and its engine started to run, after many struggles in the beginning years, due to isolation and boycotts from the western world. They also adjusted the communal responsibility slightly back to the individual responsibility in peoples life. {actually abandoning the USSR commune system]The government system in China, in its roots, is not change much, but is somewhat adjusted to the western world by using the guidelines from the French revolution esp. Napoleonic constitution and some of the Marxist egalité doctrines. This resulted in the strong central government and a semi independent provincial and local government. The head of the Provincial governments are nominated and appointed by the Central government to keep the government guidelines in tact, but below this level it is more or less autonomous with locally elected people. This is the government system in the EU and in most countries of the world. USA is an exception from the normal because it is a union of independent states. - So don’t compare the Chinese with the US system.I agree, that if the central government collapsed that their will be rebellion in the provinces. This has always occurred since millenniums, at any dynasty change. The latest was at the start of the Republic, when President Chiang Kai-Sek has to initiate the Northern expedition to control the warlords and other bandits. This is now over and nobody in China in his right mind will try to become another warlord. The Chinese people has enough civil wars and want to have peace.The collapsed of a country since history is always because of the economical downfall that was caused by the spirit of the people. A country become prosperous and people become lazy and nonchalant. This has happened with the last Qing dynasty and this has happened with many kingdoms and superpowers in Europe since Greek and Roman times. This was the reason of the USSR downfall. This will cause the downfall of the PRC may be in 2–3 centuries in the future. L’Histoire se repête.The Chinese development started very wrong during the Mao years, because they are following the USSR doctrines. Mao’s doctrines in his older years followed Stalin doctrines with his cultural revolution. If they have been on this road longer - the downfall could come during or before the collapsed of the USSR. Luckily the Chinese central government under Chairman Deng change course and clean house and let the dormant Chinese entrepreneurial spirit came to life. We see the results at this moment. The chance of collapsed with this system is very minimal to nihil. The entrepreneurial spirit is burning even to big to control, that it has to be curb by the central government. [By controlling the energy supply]WHY ??? : The fighting spirit of the Chinese people has now taken over the power of the establishment, those people, who wants to keep the environment as is since generations, the conservatives. The majority wanted to go forward and upward and don’t want to be left behind. This balance of power between the groups for renewal and conservation is crucial for the downfall or upwards development of a society. i.e. Europe’s population has now a 50/50 balance. The Middle east 30/70 [estimated] and the US 55/45. China has an overwhelming majority in the go upwards group probably 70/30. Russia has at this moment a 40/60 balance - even under Putin. During the end of the USSR it was 20/80 [This is all my personal estimate just for explaining the concept]In understanding this concept we must take history of the world as our example of how it could become. We have seen the rice and fall of the latest world powers like GB and its downfall at this moment. Just analyse the balance between the traditionalist and the progressives in UK and we could estimate the development road for the future.

Many people cannot understand the difference between how the Soviet Union was run, and how China is run. They also don’t understand the fundamentally different cultural orientation of Chinese versus Europeans, that the individual is not nearly as important to Chinese as it is to Europeans. So they see what they perceive as restrictions of liberties, and the increased imposition of totalitarian social measures, and believe that the Chinese people will rebel against this, but I don’t think they will.

271,"One can easily find faults with China, no country is perfect. Being a contrarian is a popular pastime and taking down China can be fun (at least for some). One simple argument is that the population growth is too low to support the future needs of the economy. One can also understand the problems with so much government input into the businesses in the country (the SOEs), they aren’t fully commercial yet. These are mostly arguments for slower growth and not collapse. The population argument applies to most Western countries. So, in the end one can make a valid argument that China’s march to the top is not a done deal, but arguing for collapse is very difficult (at least based on economics). What I see are arguments based on politics.As for the collapse of the US, the wealthy who run the country decided they really could take back America and during the 70s and onward, they raised taxes on the middle classes (social social security taxes is one example) while lowering their own. They have decided to cut spending at the state level. Arguments were made about efficiency but its all about cutting their connection with the rest of the country.

273,"China collapse? That’s laughable, like every other economy and country in history, China will continue to experience its fair share of bumps in the road (and outright wrecks). But China isn’t going to collapse… and in fact, just the opposite is a lot more likely: China’s soon (to the extent it isn’t already) going to lead the world.Of course, a lot of people don’t believe that. That’s because in recent years, China has been a convenient go-to excuse when markets or economies are bad. For example talking heads claim that China’s banking sector is in trouble and that China’s real estate bubble is going to pop. These storylines have put food on the table for financial journalists for years.There is truth in some of this. For example, it’s a statistics that China’s economic growth is slowing. Something that’s already very big, whether it’s an economy or a company, can’t continue to grow at a rapid pace forever. And over the past 15 years, China has become the world’s second-biggest economy.China’s economic growth has slowed to 6.5 percent a year, down from an average of 10 percent a year from 1991 to 2015.

285,"A very misleading headline as China is a developing country and its economy has to constantly evolve so that it could improve the livelihood of its people and hence there is no true colours but changing colours instead.The problem with the Chinese economy in the past is that it was addicted to the GDP-growth model via FDI as such a model provided mass jobs and wealth quickly and once you are hooked on it, it becomes like an opioid as it helped the CCP to sustain its political power via an impressive economy. But it is a middle-man economy as you are just the assembly plant of the global supply chain.Such a model becomes unsustainable after GFC as global aggregate demand is weak since quite a no. of western countries are mired in debts and so consumption was not as high as before when compared to pre-GFC days. Also, with more and more baby boomers retiring globally, they would become savers and hence they would also consume less.Hence China has to pursue a growth model based on organic growth and not heavily dependent on exports anymore and such a plan was highlighted during the 19th Party Congress last year. Because Chinese companies and some households in the first-tier cities (due to property bubbles) are incurring high debts, you need to get them to lower their debts to a sustainable level so as to reduce the bank’s NPL, lest there will be bank failures.So what we are seeing is deflation in China because of external factor (weak aggregate demand) and internal factor (deleveraging to curb the debts).This is akin to what Japan was going through during its 90’s deflation except that China is a developing country and so it could weather the storm better as poor provinces like Gansu, Guizhou etc can pick up the slack in the output gap. The Belt and Road initiative is also a strategy to export excess manpower to other countries during this transition.Still, because of the interdependence of countries in this global economy, the Chinese deflation would be exported to other countries during this transition period and hence it is a challenging time globally.",21,0.0458095238095238,0.3415714285714285,0.9225733686934396

292,"China could surpassed the USA if the USA is still bickering among themselves and doing active self destruction. What have been achieved by former presidents [since FDR] is being annihilated [yes this is the correct wording] by this administration. So the result of all this, we see it in our infrastructure that is crumbling, the expansion of the lower income class group, the decrease in social services, the decrease in the education and many more. Discrimination, is also the cause, that the intelligentia source of the country is being depleted. US is suffering from a cultural revolution by the white supremacy groups. [comparable to the Chinese Mao cultural revolution with less bloodshed]To reverse this trend, first of all the people must see and realized this self destruction evilness. The US needs a leader that could see through all these destruction and have a clear goal in mind to redeveloped the country again from scratch. At this moment we are living from the interest of the investments by past presidents. Reversing this bad evils and we will have a better future. When this happened all the seeds of development inside the country , that is readily available will be activated. Entrepreneurship in the US is the best in the world and new ideas and visions among the people has no competition. Just compare this features with, what we now find in the EU, where everybody is living only on the laurels of the past. Germany realized it -and try to correct this tendencies.The problem with all the leaders in the US now - they are either super left or super right and nothing in between. Results crooks could become leaders by their inflaming rethoric. These activities will always bring self destruction. The population is confused and frustrated with the bickering and don’t see any stopping by the fanatics on both sides.If all this stupidity inside the country ends - the US with all its potential will never go down and will never be beaten by any other country in the world. The economy will grow as fast as could be and the 50% advantage will still remain.Why ? In history the superiority of a culture will be dominating for at least a century or two. US is only half a century dominant and still have at least another century to go - unless discrimination takes the upper hand. US is not in the decline - that is only EU at this moment. China is on the rise. This is called evolution.In history it is also statistically observed [not proven], that the intelligentia of a nation is in the hybridization of the population. Proof in Europe - all the smart geniuses are found at the border region between the ethnic German, Slavic, Romanic and Semitic groups. Composers and music genius are in Austria/Italy and Rhineland. Scientific genius are found among the same groups. Proof in the USA - look and know that almost all the Nobel laureates in science are mostly immigrants or hybrids. US is dominant in this field. USA has all this features esp. in California and New England with visible results in their wealth and welfare. Compare this to China where almost everybody is from one ethnic group and only the border regions have hybridization of the people.In my personal opinion, I am not worried at all. Observe: EU wants to preserve, America wants to create and China just started to learn and India is still asleep.If the US realized their weaknesses and get rid of all this, the US will at least always be dominant in the next half a century to come. If not! - well - China will be the superpower. If US realized its weakness, than their will be 2 superpowers in the next century and this will always be the case in nature - based on the Yin/Yang philosophy.

309,"Thanks for the question. I believe your observation is accurate but the circumstances between India, China and the U.S. are all quite different with China making progress toward alleviating poverty and India making progress toward modernization of its economy(which, in itself, doesn’t alleviate poverty).The U.S., however, has been on a steady decline towards greater polarization of wealth since the Reagan administration when the neoliberal economic policies of Milton Friedman clearly replaced the Keynesian economic policies of FDR. This looked good to Americans as long as they could get cheap goods from China and live high on debt. But then, the market bubble burst and the banks called in their loans. Many people lost jobs, as well as homes, and found themselves with no health insurance. Most of them have now been taken off the unemployment roles and forced into subsistence living.The Europeans(for the most part) had successfully adopted welfare economies after World War II but such economies need a tax basis to sustain themselves and many European governments have been suckered into believing multinationalism worked better because of the long boom in the U.S. before the 2008 collapse of the market. Italy, the U.K. and France followed the U.S. on the route to globalism and to varying degrees lost their tax basis as the wealthy elite began squirreling profits in tax havens abroad, putting pressure on welfare benefits. Europeans are just beginning to discover that they too, feel the effects of globalism, but the wealthy elites will always answer that privatization is the remedy (which would inevitably eradicate welfare benefits and further increase the concentration of wealth into the hands of those elites).It is hard to know how all this will play out because many of the people that lose out end up voting for demagogues and that could readily lead to a fascist state. In order to have a revolution the losers need to realize who is manipulating them but history shows us that the manipulators always find a scapegoat.",26,0.23294721407624636,0.5080107526881721,0.954433867744467
310,"What’s your logic behind that? The US has no excuse. It is supposed to be the most advanced Democracy in the world. China and India had their problems with colonialism before the war. China was devastated because of the war. Having said that, both India and China have made significant strides in relieving poverty. America’s poverty is more difficult to address because it takes a lot more money to move that group out of poverty than in China and India. Smaller states can operate more efficiently in Europe because they are more homogeneous. Each state keeps their cultural and national identity together. The US is the least homogeneous, it is made up of peoples from around the world, though its core is mainly European. Most people think China and India are homogeneous, they are not, that’s why both countries are sub-divided into provinces/states that make each province/state more homogeneous, but like the US, not homogeneous across the entire nation.“At the dawn of the new millennium, the United Nations set a goal of eradicating poverty by 2030. With 14 years left to go, we’ve already reduced the proportion of destitute people in world by 50 percent, according to U.S. Agency for International Development administrator Gayle Smith.” Did we really reduce extreme poverty by half in 30 years?You can get a better feel for the magnitude of poverty and where it dominates in the link below.

A larger market segment means higher profit margin, because fixed expense is amortized over a larger market.In contrast, a government needs to serve all segments of its population, whether it’s profitable or not. As population gets larger, there can be more segments and more complexity in some segments, which can be ignored in a market but not by a government. So ‘bigger is better’ doesn’t apply to countries.

317,"Thanks for asking. It’s hard to summarize all the drivers. I try my best to identify the most important ones.Hard working and population. I list this item in the top because I think it is the most important one. People should never underestimate the desire of Chinese to uplift their living standard, after a century of war, famine and disorder. And population multiplied by hard working is prob the biggest engine you can imagine in the last few decades.Science, technology and economic rules. Chinese had been lagged before in these areas for too long. They can just learn these thing from western countries directly. You know, it took hundreds of years for the western countries to finally develop the skill of making computer chips and learn how to run a company and a stock exchange. These are the soft skills needed.A relatively peaceful environment and global market. As cheaply and massively as Chinese can produce. The goods need a market big enough to digest. China itself is a massive market. Not to mention the benefits of WTO. War and unstable trade environment can finish the economic growth.Politic factor 1. Actually i’m very reluctant to state this, cuz Chinese politic system is definitely not the most popular one. But imagine this, decades ago when china opened up, if all the workers required a western standard working conditions, there is no way China could make this far. On the other hand, with the development of economy, the working standard has been greatly improved. Is there any sweat factory in China ? Yes. But much fewer nowadays. As far as I know, not a single country on earth made to developed country with pure clean records. Pollution and ignorance of worker’s right are universal at the early stage. Economy first and then working condition, not the way on the contrary. No exception so far.Political factor 2. The centralized governing system enable china to develop the infrastructure needed at an astonishing speed. When government decided to build a needed railway, it just paved its way to do it. We don't waste time debating like democratic countries. I had heard a few times that Americans joking about being China for one day and pass all the bills in one time. But it will never happen in a democratic country. Yes, a lot of people lost their homes building those railways, and I don't want to be that one. But the whole country did benefit from it. It all depends on what kind of perspective you choose. I don't make judgement here.As much as China had achieved so far, the way of China is surely not the most desirable one to many. China still need to improve itself. Criticism from other countries all very important. It reminds Chinese government not to become too cocky. I believe an individual ‘s right will be treated more seriously here in the future.People often find it easy to assume democracy equals to prosperity, but fail to realize democracy itself had taken hundreds of years of evolving and developing. When one can only walk, don't ask him to run. Patience is everything. I feel very lucky that China isn't run by a three-year-old kid.",2,0.1473346560846561,0.4445546737213404,0.9971331308318755

323,"China’s economy is still developing, so it will stay at 5%-7%. However, it is slowing down for a few reasons…First and foremost, China’s provinces have a lot of debt.China’s government and provinces have a substantial amount of debt, especially for a developing country. I know that people like to point to how much debt the US and EU have and say that it’s normal for China to be in the same amount of debt, but this is just not the case… China is still developing and has much room for growth, which too much debt will ultimately restrain.I think that, if there was less debt in the country, the economy would be a lot stronger. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) seems to agree with this, as they’ve been trying to encourage less debt spending in provinces along with more accurate reporting of their actual growth figures. It’s a tough battle to fight as shadow banking is a large part of the banking system in China.It’s tough to say how much of this kind of debt there is because it’s in the shadows. Some economists say it doubles the reported debt. Some say it triples it. Some say it’s so bad we can’t even imagine it.Here’s a cool clock that shows debt from various countries! China’s is up there!I don’t know, only time will tell. We know that the CCP will step in and help if things get too bad, though, so I can say with near certainty there will be no economic collapse in China. This economic collapse would make people question the legitimacy of the CCP, so they’ll do everything they can to make sure nothing too bad happens.There is a parallel to be drawn between too much debt and economy stagnation - Japan has struggled with this and has faced decades of lost growth due to debt.However, this mentality also leads to many under-performing and inefficient companies sticking around longer than they naturally would. These inefficient companies definitely dampen China’s economic growth. We know that state-run companies are especially clunky when compared to their private sector counterparts. The CCP may further address this in the near future.Secondly, a lot of GDP growth was due to construction… This is a great short-term solution to a slowing economy, but isn’t a long-term one. Many say that China has gone on too long with their variant of quantitative easing… And they may be right. There are a lot of ghost cities in China. They may ultimately be filled with people but, for now, they’re empty or sparsely populated. The longer you go on building, the less fruitful it is for the economy. The CCP realizes this and is switching to investment in education, though building too much certainly has somewhat dampened the economy.Lastly, it really depends on how the world economy is doing and how much we’re all importing from China. Though the CCP is starting to make the transition from an export-based economy to an internal one, China’s economy is hulking, like a ship. The CCP can try to steer it, but I’m sure it’s not as nimble as they’d like. If the world economy has another crisis, the economy in China will hurt once again. I know it didn’t appear in the GDP that the CCP reported, but we know that, in retrospect, millions lost their jobs when the world entered the Great Recession. Everyone hurts when the global economy goes sour, even though the CCP didn’t want to admit it.This is why they invested in steel mills and then invested in infrastructure. Also, they may have paid steel workers to keep working when the global market for steel was in a glut… This is why other countries pointed to China for steel dumping. They’re not quite ready for a market economy and are still centrally planned, in some ways. It’s getting better, though. Once they have a strong internal economy, the CCP will interfere less.In all likelihood, we’re still going to see good growth from China! However, there are a few obstacles in the way, and the global economy does effect export-heavy countries more than import-heavy countries. Hopefully, the CCP will be able to work on this and make it easier for the next recession.Thank you for reading! Have a good day! :DEdit - added the debt clock. It’s pretty sweet!

This Chinese educated class is not the “intellectual” or “intelligentsia” group in the political or socialist sense of the word — but more in the ordinary sense of people who are somewhat more than ordinarily educated.Update:— Let’s be fair to the West. Almost no country in the West are inclined to ‘obstruct’ China, Japan, Korea, etc, in their social and technological progress. It’s really only the USA that has any such inclination — and that inclination is with the special-interest groups and parts of the government rather than of the majority of ordinary American people.MEMORIES OF AMERICAA lot of modern Chinese people know quite a fair bit about — and still aghast at — the USA’s Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 (Pub. L. 47-126, 22 Stat. 5), which was the first American statute to name a specific ethnic group from entry and immigration into the USA, including even transit through U.S. territorial waters. That law and its amendments and intermediate repeals were finally abolished only in 1943 but the legacy effects only fully gone by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (Pub. L. 82-414, 66 Stat. 163).Depending on how we might hear things, the Chinese Exclusion Act has been said to be the seedling of modern China — because of the backflow of “American Chinese” compelled to return. A lot of these ‘American Chinese’ were financial contributors to the Chinese republican revolutionaries.MEMORIES OF CANADA TOO, IF YOU DON’T MINDUpdate:— Canada isn’t off the hook. As the USA’s neighbour, Canada also took on some bad American lawmaking habits.Just three years after the USA enacted its CEA 1882, Canada enacted the Chinese Immigration Act 1885 (Ottawa: SC 48-49 Victoria, Chapter 71, 20 July 1885). It became the first-ever piece of Canadian exclusionary legislation that named a specific ethnic group. It was amended four times in 1887, 1892, 1900 and 1903.The Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) from 1881 (its founding year) imported some 17,000 Chinese immigrants as labourers to build its rail system to unite Canada.Major labour shortages existed throughout Canada but it was much more serious in the British Columbia regions. The authorities and CPR deemed it serious enough that it could threaten the very economic viability of nascent Canada. So the CPR actively recruited Chinese labourers via agencies in China.The CPR was completed on 7 Nov 1885 — six years ahead of schedule — and the Chinese labourers were almost immediately evicted and deported from Canada.The 1885 Act was a shameless piece of Canadian lawmaking and bogus legislative inquiry.To his credit, Canadian Prime Minister John A. Macdonald originally refused to introduce the prohibitive measures — but yielded to the Royal Commission headed by Quebec politician Joseph-Adolphe Chapleau and New Brunswick politician John Hamilton Gray. That Royal Commission claimed to have interviewed hundreds of people (bogus it later transpired) but included only 51 official testimonies. Many of the interview and the testimonies were highly defamatory with no basis even in basic facts.For those modern Canadians who know this, the worst was in the form of the Chinese Immigration Act 1923 (Ottawa: SC 13–14 Geo V Chap. 38, 30 June 1923, in force 1 July 1923) — known mostly today as “Canada’s Chinese Exclusion Act.” This Act banned 99% of Chinese people from immigrating and entering the country. The political groups lobbying for the enactment were mostly from the British Columbia regions.The 1923 Act was repealed in 1946. It was unquestionably clinically effective in its mission. During the Act’s 23 years of being in force, only 15 Chinese persons were accepted into Canada (source: Ninette Kelley & Michael Trebilcock, The Making of the Mosaic: A History of Canadian Immigration Policy, University of Toronto Press, 1998, page 204).During those 23 years, the Act directly caused the near-death of the Canadian Chinese community. The Act barred wives and children from joining their Chinese husbands or fathers already residing in Canada. That left no choice for the men but to return to China almost once the Act was in force.A lot of older Chinese Canadians still continue to regard 1 July (formerly Dominion Day, now Canada Day) as “Humiliation Day” — except that they don’t tell this to other Canadians to avoid unpleasantness.NOT TO BE TAKEN FOR FOOLSNot many well-read Chinese then and now can easily forget the iniquities of those Acts in curtailing their fresh new life in North America. Indeed, most well-read expatriates in the Far East then and now find the ostensible or stated aims of those Acts shamefully lacking in believability.The CJKV people are not stupid or complacent by nature.If they can see Western obstructionism, it’s pretty commonsensical to expect that they’ll redouble their efforts to do better. They are industrious people and they know how to maximise their industriousness.I say the above because it comes through from my experience of growing up in 13 different countries and working internationally for 35+ years, plus 58 years of living.Thanks for the A2A.",163,0.07218697175840033,0.34127705627705635,0.9978197741282373

342,"Equality is not purely about distribution of wealth, per se. I will say this though, no other East Asian country is more committed to capitalism than Japan. Culturally, it’s probably not ideal in Japan to flaunt your wealth; even if you do, you need a certain degree of taste and sophistication. And a sense of social responsibility would be even better.Japan is more equal in the sense that it’s a developed homogeneous country, with its citizens possessing the mindset of “collective over the individual”. This means that any Japanese citizen has measurably good access to healthcare, education, infrastructure and technology. Even though domestic politics are more polarized then the likes of the best liberal democracies, it still gets a solid A- in my book. Pure conformity has its problems though, but unity in turbulent times is not really a bad thing.I don’t really have problems with billionaires as long as they pay their taxes at the correct rate using conventional methods. I also don’t have problems with their underground bunkers if it adheres to all the laws and regulations. That said, a billionaire with a benevolent image like Warren Buffet said “…class warfare is real, and our class is winning.”Then again, to avoid fellow Quorans simply thinking that I’m a bitter hard-left, I will say that the richest people do pay the most taxes and although the accumulate wealth they also create new wealth. The US has a more potent stock market and the world-leading environment for fostering/developing startups, eventually into trans-national enterprises and big corporations.

Across a range of issues in 2017, the US moved backward on human rights at home and abroad.Trump has targeted refugees and immigrants, calling them criminals and security threats; emboldened racist politics by equivocating on white nationalism; and consistently championed anti-Muslim ideas and policies. His administration has embraced policies that will roll back access to reproductive health care for women; championed health insurance changes that would leave many more Americans without access to affordable health care; and undermined police accountability for abuse. Trump has also expressed disdain for independent media and for federal courts that have blocked some of his actions. And he has repeatedly coddled autocratic leaders and showed little interest or leadership in pressing for the respect of human rights abroad.The individuals most likely to suffer abuse in the United States—including members of racial and ethnic minorities, immigrants, children, the poor, and prisoners—are often least able to defend their rights in court or via the political process. Many vulnerable groups endured renewed attacks on their rights during the year. Other longstanding US laws and practices—particularly related to criminal and juvenile justice, immigration, and national security—continued to violate internationally recognized human rights.On any given day in the US, there are 2.3 million people in state and federal prisons and jails, the world’s largest reported incarcerated population.Racial disparities permeate every part of the US criminal justice system, including in the enforcement of drug laws. Black people make up 13 percent of the population and 13 percent of all adults who use drugs, but 27 percent of all drug arrests. Black men are incarcerated at nearly six times the rate of white men.Nearly 50,000 youth age 17 and younger are held in juvenile prisons or other confinement facilities on any given day in the US, and approximately 5,000 more are incarcerated in adult jails or prisons. Every year, 200,000 people under 18 have contact with the adult criminal system, with many children tried automatically as adults.Poor defendants throughout the United States are locked up in pretrial detention because they cannot afford to post bail. A 2017 Human Rights Watch report demonstrated that pretrial detention—often resulting from failure to pay bail—coerces people, some innocent, into pleading guilty just to get out of jail.One week after his January 20, 2017 inauguration, President Trump issued an executive order to suspend the US refugee program, cut the number of refugees who could be resettled into the US in 2017, and temporarily ban entry of nationals from seven Muslim-majority countries.To date, attempts in Congress to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA)—legislation that has greatly expanded access to health care for millions of Americans—have failed. However, the Medicaid program, private insurance subsidies, non-discrimination protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people, and other key elements of the ACA remained vulnerable to regulatory action by the Trump administration.The Trump administration’s proposed cuts to the ACA, which provides crucial services to people with disabilities, and a proposed rollback of accessibility obligations under the Americans with Disabilities Act, could undermine the rights of people with disabilities.President Trump, his cabinet appointees, and the Republican-controlled Congress rolled back some important women’s rights protections, domestically and in foreign policy, and pledged to dismantle others. Some state governments also eroded women’s rights by introducing new laws with absurd restrictions on women’s reproductive rights. Several high-profile media revelations related to sexual harassment and misconduct reinvigorated discussions around abuses suffered by women at work and in public places.In the first five months of 2017, legislators in several states introduced more than 100 bills that would attack or undermine LGBT rights. In March 2017, North Carolina partially repealed a 2016 law requiring transgender people to use government facilities according to their sex assigned at birth and barring local governments from prohibiting discrimination against LGBT people. The 2017 provisions bar local governments from passing transgender-inclusive policies and prohibit local non-discrimination ordinances from protecting LGBT people until 2020.President Trump made statements during the presidential campaign and once in office supporting the use of torture of detainees and other counterterrorism policies that would amount to violations of US and international law. Trump later backtracked on these proposals saying he would defer to Defense Secretary James Mattis, who was outspoken against torture, on interrogation matters.Throughout 2017, the US continued to carry out large-scale warrantless intelligence surveillance programs without transparency or oversight. Authorities used Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to target non-citizens (except lawful permanent residents) outside the country for warrantless communications monitoring and to “incidentally” gather large numbers of communications to or from people in the US.In one of his last acts in office, President Obama commuted the sentence of Chelsea Manning, a soldier who had received a 35-year prison term for disclosing US diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks and endured abuse while in custody. However, the US government continued to seek the extradition from Russia of Edward Snowden, the whistleblower who revealed the scope of US mass surveillance in 2013.During his inaugural address, Trump articulated a vision of foreign policy that placed “America First,” vowing to defeat terrorism, strengthen the US military, and embrace diplomacy based on US interests. Some foreign dignitaries invited to the White House early in his presidency included those with poor reputations on human rights, including Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, and Turkish President Recep Erdoğan.”Trump a Disaster for Human Rights in First YearSo, we seem to have problems of our own.

People effected will discussed it and fighting started pro and contra - a few months is gone and idea was excepted - now the studies started : technical feasibility, financial feasibility, Environment impact research, social impact research but most problems come from the political feasibility.

China, on the other hand, would want to minimize the casualties and damage in Taiwan. Isn't this odd? The ""enemy"" wants less damage, but Taiwan's own governing administration wants more damage. The DPP is not a good governing body if it is not concerned about the welfare of the people.If the KMT comes back into power on Taiwan, the 92C (1992 Consensus) will be resurrected with conciliatory cross-straits relations, and the goal of a negotiated, peaceful and gradual re-unification. Under this scenario, there will be no invasion at all, and the economy of Taiwan and the Mainland will both be bumped up during the process, with no interruption.

398,"Interesting question with an interesting answer. If you look at the economic success of Asian countries that we point to as beacons of democracy and how they became economic powerhouses, it wasn’t under democracy that they achieved that success. It was under authoritarian rule. Singapore is always the glowing light that the west suggests was successful under an democratic government. Yes, and no. It was under an autocratic benevolent leader that made Singapore what it is today. Singapore’s miracle was under the leadership of Lee Kwan Yew.Singapore’s economic miracle:“So why did Singapore succeed so comprehensively? The simple answer is exceptional leadership. Many in the world have heard of Mr. Lee Kuan Yew, the founding prime minister who passed away in March this year. Far fewer have heard of Dr. Goh Keng Swee, the architect of Singapore’s economic miracle, and Mr. S. Rajaratnam, Singapore’s philosopher par excellence.Together, they made a great team.This exceptional team also implemented three exceptional policies: Meritocracy, Pragmatism and Honesty. Indeed, I share this “secret” MPH formula with every foreign student at the Lee Kuan Yew School, and I assure them that if they implement it, their country will succeed as well as Singapore. Meritocracy means a country picks its best citizens, not the relatives of the ruling class, to run a country. Pragmatism means that a country does not try to reinvent the wheel. As Dr. Goh Keng Swee would say to me, “Kishore, no matter what problem Singapore encounters, somebody, somewhere, has solved it. Let us copy the solution and adapt it to Singapore.” Copying best practices is something any country can do. However, implementing “Honesty” is the hardest thing to do. Corruption is the single biggest reason why most Third World countries have failed. The greatest strength of Singapore’s founding fathers was that they were ruthlessly honest. It also helped that they were exceptionally shrewd and cunning.Still, Singapore has its fair share of detractors. Its political system was widely viewed as being an “enlightened dictatorship,” even though free elections have been held every five years. Its media is widely perceived to be controlled by the government and Singapore is ranked number 153 out of 180 by Reporters Without Borders in 2015 on the Press Freedom Index. Many human rights organizations criticize it. Freedom House ranks Singapore as “partially free.””Why Singapore Is the World's Most Successful SocietySouth Korea had a similar ‘miracle’:“Since 1960, South Korea’s economy has grown by something like 1,500% and its per-capita income has risen nearly eightfold. While foreign observers have had no difficulty recognizing this dazzling record for what it is, they have generally been rather less adept at explaining this nation’s extraordinary performance.“While foreign observers have had no difficulty recognizing this dazzling record for what it is, they have generally been rather less adept at explaining this nation’s extraordinary performance.”–Eberstadt, NicholasEven astute analysts have stumbled badly on the Korean economic terrain. Milton and Rose Friedman, for example, once attributed South Korea’s economic success to its “relying extensively on private markets,” while blaming the “economic stagnation and political repression” of other Asian states on central planning. Like many Western writers they were apparently unaware that the military rulers who governed South Korea in the 1960s, ’70s and early ’80s had nationalized the country’s banking system, promulgated detailed five-year plans for the local economy and presided over a legal system in which contracts between private parties were anything but binding.The outside world’s peculiar ignorance about the workings of the South Korean economy has many causes–not the least of these being official “slander against the state” strictures, which were only recently relaxed under civilian rule. Mark L. Clifford’s superb Troubled Tiger: Businessmen, Bureaucrats and Generals in South Korea (M. E. Sharpe, 357 pages, $55/$19.95) fills in some of the blank pages in the story of South Korea’s so-called economic miracle. For years after World War II, Mr. Clifford writes, most foreign experts took a dim view of this impoverished, agrarian ex-colony’s economic potential. Why the sudden take-off after prolonged torpor? Mr. Clifford gives much of the credit to Gen. (later President) Park Chung Hee, an extraordinary and complex historical figure, who masterminded a military coup against an ineffectual civilian government in 1961 and was assassinated by his own hand-picked intelligence chief in 1979.As a youth Park had served with the Japanese Imperial Army in Manchuria, where he had seen military-led development firsthand. Once in command, Park and his circle rapidly implemented their “Manchurian model” of development. They took over the banks, set up an Economic Planning Board and established a huge police/intelligence structure. But, much as he distrusted Korea’s business magnates, Park nevertheless knew he needed them for the rich country and strong army he wished to build.In a startling strategy, he arrested two dozen of the country’s top business leaders and threatened to confiscate all “illegally” amassed wealth. Park’s strike was a warning, not a massacre: The millionaires were soon released and were allowed to keep most of their money. But the rules of the new game were clear: Guided capitalism was in–and corporations that helped the government fulfill its industrial ambitions stood to prosper. A highly effective modus operandi emerged in which giant business conglomerates, or chaebols, leveraged to the hilt and nourished on cheap government credits, served as shock troops; micromanaging technocrats at the EPB and other ministries functioned like an office corps; and the Blue House (Seoul’s presidential residence) handed down battle strategy.”http://www.aei.org/publication/t...And about Taiwan:“But what is less well known is that state-owned enterprises contribute as much as 9% of GDP--and that's not counting dozens of companies in which the government has a stake of less than 50% and ones controlled by the Nationalist Party, which ruled Taiwan from 1945 to 2000. When Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists were driven out of China, they adopted interventionist economic policies in Taiwan and nationalized dozens of major businesses-such as the Bank of Taiwan, still one of the island's biggest banks.To develop the economy as rapidly as possible, Chiang and his planners directed state-owned companies to work with Nationalist Party-owned companies, public investment funds and government research organizations, as well as private companies. The cocktail worked well until the 1990s, raising living standards from $196 in 1952 to $14,000 by the turn of the century. “The ghost of Chiang Kai-shekSo, do you see the common thread that China follows to make the Chinese miracle? The myth that Democracy is the ingredient to economic success has not born fruit, at least in Asia. Do you see economic miracles in Latin America because of Democracy? How about Europe? Maybe Germany? There are failures aplenty in dictatorships and that’s what the west sees as failures compared to Democracy. But, what rings true is that Democracy is not necessarily the vehicle for a successful national economic rise. Democracy seems to show its glow only after everyone has their basic needs fulfilled and can think of broader conditions for the their future.",30,0.18367803560818263,0.4544597763347765,0.8728725935138195
399,"China achieved this by realising a few things in the 1970’s:The realization that China possessed many of strengths needed to become a global superpower. It had the agrarian land to be self-sufficient in its food supply. If managed properly, such strengths combined could give China the financial ability to developThe realization that China would never achieve its potential if it did not increase its knowledge base.The realization that its population, and in particular the growth of its population, could become the nation’s Achilles heal. If China’s population growth was not matched with economic growth and employment then the resulting mass unemployment would cause mass poverty, civil unrest and a revolt against the rule of the Communist Party.This comprehensive analysis of China’s state of affairs was translated into policy in 1979 and saw the birth of China’s ‘open door’ economic policy that led to rapid economic development. China’s ‘open door’ economic policy gradually opened up China’s economy to foreign companies in a process well controlled by the Communist Party.The key features of this model were:China created Special Economic Zones (SEZ) in the coastal Guangdong and Fujian provinces, that were designed to attract foreign investment in low-end manufacturing by offering cheap land, labour and a variety of tax and other incentives. This turned China into an export oriented economy and dependent on foreign countries to continue importing from it. The hope was in the future the coastal cities would lead to the development of China’s interior. For most of the last 30 years, these coastal clusters acted as Beijing’s experimental and carefully monitored interface with the outside world.The value of the Yuan, low wages and cheap exports were all controlled by the communist party to placate the Chinese population. To make Chinese goods more attractive than Japanese and German goods, the Chinese government controlled the value of the exchange rate of its currency with the world, rather than let it float freely. China kept the value of its currency artificially low, which made it cheaper to purchase consumer goods – far cheaper for the world than anyone else. By China undercutting the world, aside from keeping Chinese factories open, this also meant most Chinese citizens had a job. Chinese factories made little profits on the goods they export, due to the low exchange rate the potential profit is lost. According to the Chinese Ministry of Finance, Chinese profits on their exports are about 1.7%.At the heart of China’s economic development has been the nation’s banking system. In China the government used the national banking system to serve the Communist parties objectives. The nation’s large savings were funnelled through banks to firms through subsidized rates. In order to qualify for such loans firms were required to maintain high employment (in order to maintain social cohesion), rates of return on capital, building brands, customer service and profit played no part of this process.China’s growth also came from both huge state investment in infrastructure and heavy industry. 159 large State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), provide the key inputs from utilities, heavy industries and energy resources that facilitate the private sector. The aggressive outward investment strategy, driven by SOEs and state banks with massive pools of cash allowed China to spread across the world looking to expand markets, employ services and buy up resources.",45,0.08763248847926268,0.38403609831029184,0.9975808482234381
400,The short Answer to this is “because of Shimomuran Macroeconomics plus the Mandate of Heaven.” Shimomuran Macroeconomics provides the no-cost investment credit creation of 25% of GDP annually which produces rapid economic development and the Mandate of Heaven focuses Chinese economic policy on improving the incomes of all its people. SeeWhat is Shimomuran economics? andHow do you describe the Mandate of Heaven?Why does George Tait Edwards see Shimomuran-Wernerian macroeconomics as the key understanding in the future of mankind?,2,0.06666666666666667,0.30416666666666664,0.9038219553885481

405,"They didn't, they really didn't.China was wrecked by WW2 and colonialism before it. The issue is, China actually has recovered from disasters dozens of times to become the most powerful nation on the planet. Had the KMT stayed in power and maintained an alliance with the West, China would have adapted faster than it did under Mao. The Glorious Revolution was a disaster, and by 1970, China and Russia weren't even really friends. In 1979, China fought a war with Vietnam, and they'd been the best of allies.What happened is in homes across China, generational knowledge had a frank conversation with grandmothers telling children and grandchildren that the status quo was a disaster.China watched India growing Dwarf Wheat, buying American tractors and Taiwan, Japan and South Korea growing and thriving, while 60% of China had to work in the fields to feed the nation.1979, the one-child policy was used to slow the constant build up in agriculture of generational power. If a majority of your citizens are engaged in one economic model you can't change it without a huge lever to push a lot of rocks into motion. The Authoritarians saw the one child policy as the key.

They could buy gold to cover currency swaps, buy industrial equipment from the East and West, and build for the Japanese who were on a bull run.The big trip up was Tiananmen.

407,"Obviously this requires a multifactorial set of answers. But taking historical comparisons and common sense, there are a few factors that may enlighten one’s understanding of the question.Management: Looking at many similarly successful economies in the region and further afield that have made the industrialised economic leap without colonialisation ie. Singapore, Sth Korea, Taiwan in the 70–90s, they all had a strong central government (lowish on the democracy scale) and instituted meritocracy, adopted experts’ input and efficiently applied their limited resources towards key infrastructure projects that lifted their national competitiveness and attracted foreign investment. They avoided the expenses of ‘too many voices’ and dramatic policy shifts that are common in countries with more ‘advanced’ democracy. Focus and speedy implementation paid back in accelerated outcome.Personnel: Along the meritocracy line and taking a pause on the Western centric view of the Chinese bureaucracy and corruption, the selection process of government cadres is rigrious and no parachuting of ultra-wealthy business tycoons into the system. They all start from the grassroots and serve their time from village leader to provincial head and rotated around the country, then to positions closer to the central government and eventually to the peak leadership, primarily based on merits and experiences. Take Xi as an example, he was effectively managing provincial levelled economies in his 40s, with GDP that matched or exceeded many countries. His knowledge of the country and management skill will easily exceed any of the professional politicians and bureaucrats out in the US and other developed countries. Then another angle on members of the central polibureau, a large portion of them came through elite universities with engineering and economic qualifications, again contrast with the non-technical professional background of many Western politicians.Hungry: After so many decades being dirt poor and over 100 years of being stepped on by foreign powers since the corrupt late Qing dynasty, there’s a genuine national yearning for an upswing. Given the leadership, a highly motivated society mobilised strongly and the energy was appropriately guided along. The energy spent was rewarded along the way with major objective improvements in their quality of life, further energising the effort of a hungry for success population. As for past American successes, it was a country of opportunities that rewards efforts.Stability: Pushing a global economy based on mutual respect and win-win Moralistic Model, there’s no military conflicts and the burden of a massive military budget (barely 1/3–1/4 of US’s). It’s the necessary environment for economic prosperity.Sure there are other factors, but these are no different to the pre-requisites of a successful startup company or any public company there is. Deviate from these and it’ll all collapse in a burning heap.",1,0.10130196523053668,0.3885411942554801,0.9840467244035314
408,"The answer to this question is not complicated but just basic economics. China simply followed the path that was taken by first Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan in the 1950s and then Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and others in the 1960s and is now also being taken by Vietnam, Bangladesh, India and others. The scenario is basically the same with the exact same ingredients with just a little local flavour to spice things up a little.First ingredient is lots of cheap land open for factory development. In China this was speeded up by the Communist Party’s willingness to use force to remove any locals who did not like being told to vacate the wanted land which their family had lived on for decades. Since the Chinese Communist Party owns all the land in China outright with Chinese citizens being only leaseholders this was not a legal problem.The second ingredient is lots of cheap labour ready and eager to be employed in developed factories. After 30 years of Chinese Communist Party misrule, madness and chaos the Chinese worker was poor and getting poorer and earned some of the lowest wages in the world. Also there was a lot of them thanks to the family planning policies set in place in the 1950’s and 1960’s. Chinese people are legendary for their industrious and capacity for hard work and this plus the low wages made them a highly attractive pool of labour.Third ingredient is access to cheap capital for investment. In China’s case this was managed in two ways. First the Communist Party leadership designated certain geographic zones mainly along the coast that would be opened to foreign investment. Investment capital began to flow in from Japan, Hong Kong, Korea, Taiwan and others eager to take advantage of the economic potential of China. This capital investment was so successful that the party leadership eventually extended the investment zone to include all of mainland China. Secondly the party leadership began to direct state owned banks to provide cheap capital to mainly state owned enterprises but also party approved privately owned Chinese enterprises.Fourth ingredient is a cheap currency exchange rate against the US dollar. A cheap currency makes a countries exports highly competitive in the global markets.Fifth ingredient is access to technology and modern industrial and financial practices. China has not had to reinvent the wheel indeed it has not had to invent anything. Everything China needed could simply be bought of the shelf. From modern steel production to cotton shirts and socks, to plastic toys, to microwave ovens, refrigerators, televisions and air-conditioners, and then to motorcycles, computers, mobile phones, cars and trucks and fast trains, the Chinese did not have to invent them just acquire the plans and methods to build them. In this they were helped by an army of foreign technicians and managers who flooded into China from Hong Kong, Japan, Taiwan, Korea and elsewhere to oversee the setting up of factories and the training and instruction of the workers. China has also benefitted from easy access to modern financial planning and accounting practises, taxation and urban planning. All of which it could simply purchase on the open market.Six ingredient is access to raw materials. Here China, like all the other countries that have taken the same path, has benefitted from an open global market in raw materials. Countries like Australia, Brazil, Indonesia, Canada and many others in Africa and around the world have supplied all the raw materials that China needs.Seventh ingredient is open export markets. Here China again like its peers has benefitted from the open global liberal economic order that was established after the Second World War. China has been able to export its way to prosperity because countries around the world have believed in open markets and free trade. This is especially in the case of the US and the EU the two most important markets for Chinese products.The final ingredient is investment in key infrastructure. Ports and airports, roads and rail, power generation and telecommunication are all vital. The Chinese Communist Party can and should be given credit for the standard of infrastructure that has been built but apart from the initial decision to abandon socialism and embrace market economics that's the only real credit it should receive for the economic success that has been achieved. China simply followed the same path undertaken elsewhere and the same result would have transpired if China had been governed by any competent government which understood basic economics.",3,0.11111146831891514,0.3808469721767593,0.9979022831543667

The other being Japan and Saudi Arab oil producer.Kissinger play a very important role in China becoming global export powerhouse and factory to the world. This is not known by many people.  Kissinger is the kingmaker for the US-China relationship. His key to the success of Petrodollar hegemony created in 1971, is to get China to be the big user of US dollar. This strategy reinforce US dollar as the global reserve currency. US dollar when become the sole global reserve currency, US Congress can print as much billion US dollars they want to finance military spending and social food stamps programs for the over 20 million jobless.China now addicted to US dollars and hold more than 3 trillion US dollar in foreign exchange reserve.Another angle to look into is Kissinger wanted very much for China and US combined forces together during the cold war. Then this allowed globalist elite with US doing the dirty work, to screw the Soviet Union and cause the breakup into Russia.This allow globalist elite from city of London and Wall Street to loot Russia more than 3 trillion dollars of Russia natural resources until Putin put a stop to it. That is why globalist elite want to get rid of Putin.

415,"This is one of the main reasons why people invest in emerging markets. However, experience has shown your question encompasses three investment fallacies:Stock prices are based on expectations of growth. So that while the Chinese economy may grow faster than the US economy, in theory that should already be reflected in the stock price. The price of the stock will already reflect a higher expected rate of growth of earnings, meaning a higher P/E ratio. Remember: there’s no such thing as a free lunch. You can’t get a higher return without taking higher risk.However, at this point the Chinese market actually trades at a lower price/earnings ratio than the US market, so that’s not necessarily a problem.2. While the Chinese economy may be growing faster than the US economy, there’s nothing to say that an individual company’s profits — or even all companies’ profits — will grow faster. It may be that competition in China is tougher, or wage growth is higher, and in fact their companies’ profits can be lower. Ultimately it’s profits that you’re buying, not GDP.3. Many companies, especially in China, are producing for the global economy, not the domestic economy, so the growth rate of the country that they’re located in doesn’t make that much of a difference. A company like Foxconn, which produces a lot for Apple, will trade much like Apple (I’d assume).This graph gives the 12m moving average of the monthly returns on each market. As you can see, often the S&P 500 has outdone the Chinese market. The variation in return also shows another aspect of investing in emerging markets: the returns are much more volatile. In 2015 you would’ve made a lot more money in China, but you would’ve lost a lot of it in 2016.The classic study on this question is “Economic growth and equity returns” by Jay Ritter. Its abstract reads:It is widely believed that economic growth is good for stockholders. However, the cross-country correlation of real stock returns and per capita GDP growth over 1900–2002 is negative. Economic growth occurs from high personal savings rates and increased labor force participation, and from technological change. If increases in capital and labor inputs go into new corporations, these do not boost the present value of dividends on existing corporations. Technological change does not increase profits unless firms have lasting monopolies, a condition that rarely occurs. Countries with high growth potential do not offer good equity investment opportunities unless valuations are low.Of course this study finished in 2002; things may have changed since then. I’m not aware of any more recent studies.",5,0.14271080368906458,0.396403162055336,0.8650282055973839

423,"Different flavors of Communism:Soviet Union was a dogmatic country that practiced socialism not just politically, but economically too. The Soviet model called for extreme state involvement - the state made everything from needles to rockets on its own with little ( heavily controlled) or no private participation. Profitability and wealth generation was never the prerogative for communist Russia. This led to a corrupt, top heavy governance that ruled over a largely low income populace. It’s also important to mention that Marxist-Leninism, the founding principle of the Soviet Union, was a native concept that came out of the Russian revolution. The overthrow of the Tsars by the Bolsheviks, headed by Lenin and others, led to the very formation of the Soviet Union. And it was these very communist ethos that had delivered them out of world war 2. Hence, it was very hard for an ordinary Russian to think of any other form of governance.For China, communism was an alien concept that Mao imported to knit the country together. Whilst it delivered on that, in a rather bloody way, it wasn’t the best fit governance model for the Chinese. From times immemorial, Chinese have been makers and traders. The Soviet way of heavy regulation and extreme state involvement didn’t suit the Chinese psyche. The model also didn’t serve the soaring billion plus population. So, in the 70s, China pragmatically switched to capitalism for its economy. China of today is no less capitalistic than the US. A free market economy that has sprung up some of the world’s biggest enterprises and hence billionaires.Now coming to your question - will the gagging Chinese lead to an economic collapse of their country? Hell, no. There’s has not been a single country in the recent past that has pulled out so many millions out of poverty in such a short span of time. China, today, has arrived on the world stage. And that wouldn’t have happened with all the Chinese “talking”. Political communism ensured the Chinese talked less and worked more and it’s paying off.

431,"It’s a complicated issue but one that the foreign press is generally getting entirely wrong.Among the major cited cases by foreign media it’s almost all rubbish, the only case where it might not be rubbish is OrdosOne has to keep in mind of context and scale, China has one of the largest populations in the world, you may think a 5 block empty apartment = ghost city, but when you consider the context of population and density, the level it takes for things to really get out of hand in China is simply not the same.The 60 minutes piece on ZhengZhou in particular is a classic example of just awful irresponsible reporting. Because since then that place has filled up and then some, ZhengZhou is probably on the front end of a successful development case in recent years. It’s airport volume has grown by ridiculous scale . It is now one of the largest freight airport IN THE WORLD in no small part because more than 1/8 of the world’s phones (and more than 50% of iphones) are shipped out from here.Even right after the 60 minutes report expats living in China were already calling out that the report on Zhengzhou is highly dubious at best.[1]One simply needs to know that Zhengzhou has a freaking 9.5 million population and probably more like 10 million at least in real practice once accounting for Migrants. even just inside city proper a conservative estimate is well over 4 million. making it well within the top 60 most populated city in the world, in a city that most non-Chinese almost certainly never heard of unless they work in the Iphone related business.So in these sort of cities, it’s almost impossible to have ghost cities just by default. Most of the other discussion among western Media have been in similarly ridiculous 1st or top end 2nd tier cities like Shanghai (lol) ShenZhen or HangZhou, it’s just not happening.The infamous “fake Paris” 天都城 in Hangzhou according to recent local report is seeing pretty significant sales activity now [2] This shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone who has any idea that Hangzhou has been one of the most desirable cities for Chinese to live in for…. oh at least a freaking thousand year? it’s where Alibaba HQ is located. the idea that a major plot can be long term uninhabited BECAUSE OF DEMAND is simply absurd.Hilariously, I was just talking to a friend who’s specifically working as a public servant handling all the major building project’s approval paperwork and progress in her province ( one of the poorer once in China.) and in our conversation she points out hilariously that one of the main reason why some of these units are unsold is because….. the Government moved in previous residents or some other people they deem in dire need of housing who are usually poorer folks, and thus the richer folks shy away from buying them because they don’t want to live near poor people. When you actually know that you began to question much you assume about the CCP or China in general.That is not to say that China DOESN’T have major housing blocks where you seriously question their long term viability, but it is almost NEVER the once western media report. Instead it is those in cities even Chinese don’t know about, it’s the not even 3rd tier cities which can often see big boom and bust cycles in a hurry due to mining or other unreliable industries, however these cities can still get close to a freaking million people all the time. Ordos is a very big city of this nature (it’s in Inner Mongolia which mostly is relying on mining.) but there are much more smaller city of this ilk all over the place.Because if you just look at the marco picture, China’s not very urbanized yet, it doesn’t take much of an even common sense person to figure out that going forward millions and millions or people will still be moving into major cities, this makes ghost cities inside the more highly desirable cities simply a hilarious proposition that only fools or people with highly dubious motives would make.HOWEVER, because China is so big, and also the nature of things, it is very possible that a lot of current 3rd tier or lower cities could go bust population wise down the road either because people move to better cities or because the industry there simply decline. and these “small” cities are still huge by any normal standards which could mean we have a lot of Detroit situations in China.Footnotes[1] A Closer Look At The Chinese 'Ghost Mall' Seen On '60 Minutes' Reveals A Complicated Picture[2] 杭城溢出效应持续 星桥二手房价达到26000+",45,0.053324367110774894,0.47050585606410833,0.997570290347381

Properties are not bought by buyers to stay, because they couldn’t afford it. Sooner or later, the bubble will explode.6. Electricity, water, internet, all those assets are privately owned.

435,"We need to note the nature of the “empty cities”. There are basically two types: developer run out of money and properties built but no people living there.Developers bankrupted. The problems end there, the banks absorb the bad debts and that’s the end. There are still remedies, the government can still attract financially stable developers to finish off; typically they might offer other incentives without putting up cash. In any case, the problems are ‘contained’, losses are spread and shared.The other case is just not enough people moving to those cities. People who had brought the properties just let the properties stay empty, by far the most people did not have plan for future rental income to pay off mortgages, so they just end up with idle assets, of course situation not ideal but no big social unrest.Because China is still growing and land indeed are using up, situations improving all the time.

First, some existed because residents who had purchased homes didn’t move in until schools and government services were in, ie things like buses, government offices, etc. Ordos was the first ‘ghost city’ that brought on this mania. Today it is almost fully sold out and being occupied. Then there was Foxconn’s town being built to accommodate thousands of workers, same type report of a ghost city, then there was the university in Kunming being relocated to an urban area outside of city center because the existing university campus had no room to expand, and the litany of ghost cities went on to be nonsense.

The market for that huge supply of consumer good was kept rampant by Greenspan with low interest rates. Globalization experts could not understand that free trade is not a good idea if, especially if both parties have unequal restrictions on trade. Even today, google is not working in China. Free trade can only work if both countries apply similar trade restrictions. Price levels (general) may be an issue.Sell goods to the American market: China must sell goods to the market, not necessarily the USA market.

So, in general, the interactions are generally good.Of course, there were bad experience too, for example, I remember Chinese people had complains about Apple in its product recall policy for Chinese customers, the same model, same product, if they were sold elsewhere outside China, were recalled and the product were replaced, just like that; but the same did not happen in China. So, Apple got a bad name for a while, but eventually most people forget and Apple in general is still a ‘liked’ product in China. In my action, it was the specific actions and attitude that was in question, not the “nationality”.I think from the point of view on “doing business” these transactions we had described are ‘mutual benefit’ deals (or “win win”) there no “who thank who” but in general both side would normally thank each other and shake hands.

My own feeling is that those statement were mainly from people not so close to the individual case by case deals, like the US government not necessarily saying the same things the US enterprises in China would say, they are saying certain things for those US enterprises in the USA who did not move their production to China or other places, and they are not competitive.From what I know about the world and businesses etc in this day and age, multinational companies just do what is best for their shareholders, they are not so obliged to put their operations back to their countries of origin.I do hope that the Chinese with very strong nationalistic feelings can learn to be more grateful to the American corporations who are willing to set up in China.

In that sense the small brokerage firms in HKare not serious, the institutions want to deal with bank backed brokers. In that vision also a lot of small HK brokers have lost the faith of overseas investors which look to deal with brands and big money. In China there are these local brokers with big brands and big capital but seriously they are also anyway in HK with rep offices, so HK is still there.The real money is now also with the retaili investors of China, and in that regard they will prefer to deal with local stockbrokers.

Maybe in the future it might become one, but as she goes from developing to developed, China still has some protectionist laws that limit, especially foreign, participation. This is normal for a developing country because companies from developed states can easily overrun and monopolize markets within that country. To some degree, you see that happening in China.

After WW2,almost all countries in Europe and Asia were devastated by the war, America was not. Her military industrial factories were turned to peaceful goods and products. Our auto industry was booming, our aircraft industry was booming, our consumer goods spilled out into the world, our agriculture was the most efficient in the world. We were the king of the mountain.Then the world started to rise from its ashes, we stayed fat dumb and happy. In the last 50 years, the world’s economics started to change, poor countries started to rise, developing countries became developed, but America led the technology frontiers.

Check out the want ads and you find plenty of good paying job openings, we just don’t have the skills to fill them. Our government has failed to connect the dots. Today and in the future, factory jobs are disappearing to automation and robotics. A high school education won’t cut it. Some forward looking states recognize that and are starting to offer free college education (with conditions).

Our POTUS believes in fossil fuels and allowing drillers to invade our pristine coastlines and national parks.Our foreign policy is still one of war and isolationism. Our allies are moving farther away and our competitors are being chastised and penalized. We say we are the land of the free and have a society that welcomes all religions and political beliefs. Our actions belie that claim. We used to be the dream of immigrants, now we are the land closed to immigrants. We fail the test of history. The US rise was built by immigrants. If you look into our past, much of our gains and ideas came from immigrants or their children. Today, we have hollow rhetoric that tries to keep the illusion that the US is the best place in the world. That is becoming a mirage.The glimmer of hope is starting to show in pre-election results. Women, independents, young people are taking our politics to a new level of energy and righteousness. If this continues, and the citizens of America support it, maybe, just maybe, it is not too late. But, we have a lots of catching up to do on all fronts. Political, social, educational, infrastructure, and most crucial of all technology. We need to continue our technology rise by keeping our best students focused on STEM. We need immigrants who want to share the American dream. We want citizens to want America to continue the greatness that has attracted them since our beginnings. We are still a young sovereign state and our lessons are for all to see. Our wars, conflicts, and meddling in other countries need to come to an end. We are not the super race. We need to have a peaceful rise, no more, no less than China is doing today. We need the energies of all our citizens to continue the greatness that makes Americans America.",25,0.06961921850079743,0.3606240031897927,0.9610396687414975
511,"Sometimes I say very coldly.If a nation is an empire, its people will be able to live at a higher standard of living while working less, than the people of a nation that is not.This is especially apparent in the case of the people in lower class of the social classes.The empire provides them with a lot of free resources and credit for the stability of their own society.The more China takes the power from the United States as an empire, the more the United States will lose advantages in that aspect.This is probably a description of the situation we are already seeing.The Economist magazine recently wrote that 'Western societies tend to offer high self-esteem to low-grade students compared to the Orient.'(I have recently written on this issue under criticisms of the Orient. Personally I think the writer of The Economist magazine might have read this, but the truth is beyond me..Dong-Yoon Lee's answer to Why are Confucian societies—Singapore, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, China—so successful? )The United States needs to stimulate or encourage low-performance students to prevent the deterioration of their national strength. In this aspect, Obama was definitely right.The American journalists frustrated Obama's efforts by vigorously criticizing Oriental education for suppressing students' creativity and causing inhuman life. But by now, there is no other way to surpass Obama's the idea. Americans must face reality. One should get as much one’s efforts.If it is a world where one man work hard and tired but do not earn reasonable income, is not this an inhuman thing?The United States has been flooded with all kinds of trash in the air and nature, and now it is also using the patience of poor Chinese workers as resources.All reservoirs are not infinite.

In the long term, the US will lose and have lost many low end jobs to China. Therefore, if your job is not low end, your wellbeing is improved by the rise of China. If your job is a low end one then your life will be devastated by the rise of China.This has come a long way.Pat Buchanan ran for president in 1988 with this clearly written on his slogan and he was against NAFTA. There were not many jobs replaced by the foreign competition yet. Pat Buchanan did not stand a chance and he did not even make it to be the Republican candidate.Ross Perot ran for president in 1992 with the same idea. This time he got more following, but he still did not come close and he lost. Then there were 8 years Clinton years. You do not expect Democrats to fight for jobs for low end Americans, since those were blue collar white workers who were not their voting pack.Then in year 2000, George W ran for president. He somehow did not mind Americans losing a lot of jobs. He did not as long as the US corporations made a lot of money.Then in 2008 Obama won the presidency and he was just weak.Donald Trump won presidency in 2016 not because he was smart but because there have enough jobs lost from 1988 and so many that the losers of the globalization got together and supported Donald Trump.

518,"Semiconductors is not a monolithic industry, there are a bunch of different areas. The area where China is furthest behind is in semiconductor fabrication equipment. There is really only 1 company left that is state of the art in the world, and that is ASML in Holland, and their lasers are supplied by an American company.Catching up to ASML might take decades, or it might never happen. The current state of the art in China is 2 decades behind what ASML produces.In terms of fabless design, China has pretty much caught up with the rest.Given the current situation in semiconductor manufacturing, I think China will dominate in ASICs but remain behind in CPU, GPU, Memory. China has a cost advantage in designing and producing large varieties of low-medium volume chips because the fixed cost of starting a new chip production is cheaper in China. (This is mostly a labor intensive process requiring lots of engineers)Taiwan/South Korea/US will continue to dominate in the high volume products like CPU, GPU, Memory because you can amortize the up front startup costs over huge volume with these products. The per unit cost is more affected by manufacturing yield than startup cost. To bring the per unit cost down you need to use the most advanced semiconductor fabrication technology, which China does not have access to.This is why you see Bitcoin mining dominated by Chinese companies. Whenever there is some niche application that requires a couple of million custom chips, Chinese companies will be very competitive. China might catch up to South Korea in memory over time, since the gap is only a few years.Semiconductor equipment manufacturing is where the gap is the largest, but in some sense it is also the least important. The reason for this is because we are reaching the point of diminishing returns from making features smaller. The difference between 5 years out of date and state of the art in terms of actual value to end users is not that big. I personally use a CPU in my computer that was made 5 years ago and I have no particular need to upgrade any time soon.",22,0.05946354299295476,0.43662762074526784,0.9571381402882665
519,"China is now investing billions (I think 30 billions USD or so) to try to become the “dominant power in semiconductor industry”. Note that this was attempted before, in the 90’s, and it was an utter failure.China is consumer of semiconductors: it accounts for 45% of the worldwide demand for chips, both for domestic use and for export electronic products.However more than 90% of its consumption relies on imported integrated circuits. For example yout “made in China” Apple phone or computer is only assembled in China, most of the components, certainly the more high tech ones like the integrated chips, are usually not made in China at all.The other 10% are usually “crap electronics’ that end up in those “made in China” products that break if you look at them funny.Integrated-circuit companies in China entered the semiconductor market about 20 years after the rest of the world - and since then they have been trying to catch up. Note that 20 years in electronics is a HUGE time.The Chinese government made several attempts to build a local semiconductor industry, most famously in the 90’s, but to no avail.China seems now to focus on what I call “craptronics” - cheap products that are less powerful and often less reliable than their western (or Japanese/Korean) competitors. Still these low cost devices have flooded the market and are becoming very popular., especially among people who want to save a buck. In fact Android phones designed in China now represent more than 50 percent of the global market.So yeah, China is technologically behind the West (and Japan / Korea) but since now we are hitting a wall in Moore’s law, China is like the fat kid catching up to the rest of the runners who are already at the finish line.Point is, however, that even if China never reaches the other players, it can be come HUGE in the electronics market just by providing low-cost electronics.After all why fork 1000 USD for a new iPhone, when you can pay 100 USD and have basically the same device (just not as good).Not that even if in the West people might care about “quality”, in China consumers seem to be less worried about it. Think about all the “cheap knockoffs” that exist in China, that many westerners laugh at, but still have a market there.And China, with over 1 billion people, is a HUGE market. If the Chinese government promotes to “buy local”, they already have abouy 18% of the world population as a market.In addition it can probably expand into developing countries where people also do not have the luxury to buy iPhones or similar high-end electronics.In conclusion: China is unlikely to catch up in terms of quality any time soon, but market wise it’s already catching up - and that’s what they are really caring about.",3,0.16555759457933372,0.4921950875211743,0.9337961715691124

539,"What is the reason of the impressive economic growth of China? Let’s have a look on the list of countries by real GDP growth rate (2017; source: Wikipedia). Here are the first twenty:It is obvious: the poorer a country, the higher its GDP growth is. It is easy to double your GDP if you are still in the process of coming out from the stone age. These are growth rates, this means relative numbers (percentages). Increasing the GDP of Libya by 10% of course needs much smaller effort than increasing the GDP of Switzerland by 10%. (Macau is somewhat exceptional, the very high GDP growth is caused by a 26% drop in 2015.) It is hardly surprising that all countries with extremely high per capita GPD have very low GDP growth, around 1% (see Norway or Switzerland). So China can produce a high GDP growth only because it is still a developing country with a low GDP.“What? LOW GDP??? How can you tell that, the nominal GPD of China is already second of the world, and already first if you count in PPP!” — will say some quorans now. Who cares? The population of the USA is one-fourth of that of China, still this small population can produce much more than the enormous population of China — because the difference here is rooted in the more developed ways of production due to technical development, more effective workpower etc. If you divide the GDP with the population, you will see that China is still very undeveloped — the per capita GDP of China roughly equals with that of Kazakhstan or Lebanon. OK, let’s use some creative statistics, e.g. count in PPP (Purchasing Power Parity), because it might be true that Chinese workers produce less goods, but within China these goods have greater value (because everything is cheapter in China than in the developed countries)! Is it good for us? It isn’t. Even if we calculate in PPP, Gabon, Turkmenistan, Belarus, even Iraq are all above China.Another problem is that it is very difficult to know the actual, true GDP growth of China. The official numbers published by the Party are around 6-7%, but many experts believe that this number is entirely fabricated, and the real number is around 2%. An additional problem is that any comparison of GDP data is only meaningful among different MARKET ECONOMIES. China, although it is very far from being communist, it is equally far from being a market economy. It is dominated by government-owned enterprises which usually allocate lots of money into investments with no real economic value, which will cause an ostensible increase in the GDP, but will create only very little additional goods (More about this here: Is China's Economy Growing As Fast As China's GDP?, thanks to Dale Coder for the suggestion). In fact these government-owned enterprises are used by the ruling Party to artificially keep high the GDP growth values (for propaganda reasons); it also should be mentioned that they are frequently parts of the corruption network and they function as pathways to channel money from the public sphere to private pockets of Party leaders and their extended families, but creating no value.As China is getting more developed, its GDP growth rate is decreasing rapidly. The GDP growth of China was close to 20% in the 1970’s (no surprise — China was incredibly poor that time, particularly the Cultural Revolution nearly brought it to collapse, therefore the growth skyrocketed after the Cultural Revolution!) and still high above 10% in the 1980’s-1990’s, even slightly above 10% a decade ago. Now it is about 6-7%, and keep decreasing. There is nothing surprising in this. Consider Taiwan. 30 years ago it also had about 5-10% growth; with the development of Taiwan it decreased to the present 2%. China is now approximately where Taiwan was 30 years ago, and be sure that further sharp decrease of the GDP growth is unavoidable; actually we are already about halfway in this process. There is nothing bad in it. The only question is whether Chinese will manage to become rich before the growth will stop, or rather the growth will stop soon and China will freeze in the current developing stage. This is difficult to predict, partly because the economy of China is so intransparent. But as many experts think that the official numbers published by the Party are much nicer than the reality, the future does not seem too bright.",24,0.12586111111111103,0.47561887694145766,0.533885084062546
540,"Throughout our human kind’s history, we can see cycles of ups and downs, rises and falls. We often say there is an “Invisible Hand” behind all the myth of cycles, maybe it’s the God, maybe it’s the Tao, the principle of Taoism, which is taken as the source, pattern and substance of everything that exists. Or we call it “fate.”Ancient China was prosperous both in economy and culture in several feudal dynasties including Tang, Ming, etc. It turned into decline during Qing Dynasty when the rulers decided to close its door.And if we check most other ancient strong powers, we will also find that those with an “open door” policy, either encouraging to go out or welcoming outsiders to come in, no matter what means they took, maybe by war, maybe by colonizing, maybe by trade, would get stronger.For Europe, as a whole, it had led the world for centuries, ever since The Great Voyage Age, after Christopher Columbus reached and found the New World during his first voyage in 1492.First it was Portugal, according to Wiki,Portugal - Wikipedia“In the 15th and 16th centuries, Portugal established the first global empire, becoming one of the world's major economic, political and military powers. During this period, today referred to as the Age of Discovery, Portuguese explorers pioneered maritime exploration, notably under royal patronage of Prince Henry the Navigator and King John II, with such notable voyages as Bartolomeu Dias' sailing beyond the Cape of Good Hope (1488), Vasco da Gama's discovery of the sea route to India (1497–98) and the European discovery of Brazil (1500). During this time, Portugal monopolized the spice trade, and the empire expanded with military campaigns in Asia. However, events such as the destruction of Lisbon in a 1755 earthquake, the country's occupation during the Napoleonic Wars, and the independence of Brazil (1822), left Portugal crippled from war and diminished in its world power.”Then, the Netherlands (or Holland, or the Dutch), according to Wiki,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ne...“In the Dutch Golden Age, spanning much of the 17th century, the Dutch Empire grew to become one of the major seafaring and economic powers, alongside Portugal, Spain, France and England. Science, military, and art (especially painting) were among the most acclaimed in the world. By 1650, the Dutch owned 16,000 merchant ships. The Dutch East India Company and the Dutch West India Company established colonies and trading posts all over the world, including ruling the northern parts of Taiwan between 1624–1662 and 1664–1667. The Dutch settlement in North America began with the founding of New Amsterdam on the southern part of Manhattan in 1614. In South Africa, the Dutch settled the Cape Colony in 1652. Dutch colonies in South America were established along the many rivers in the fertile Guyana plains, among them Colony of Surinam (now Suriname). In Asia, the Dutch established the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), and the only western trading post in Japan, Dejima.”Then the UK, after the 1588 Defeat of the Spanish Armada, began to rise and later established an ""empire on which the sun never sets"".After the World War I, UK had to concede its world leading banner to the United States of America. And ever since WWI, the USA, though witnessed its own ups and downs, has ever maintained its economic might and its status as a world leader.But no nation or region can maintain at its peak forever, otherwise we can’t call it a “peak.” As I mentioned at the beginning of my answer, there are rises and falls, Portugal, the Netherlands, the UK......And, it seems the US is also no exception of the fate.As history has told us, when there is one falling, there is another rising. Then, who is the one on the rise currently in the international community? Actually, many. But who is the one which might and have the capability to shoulder more responsibility? The answer might be: China.Now, go back to the question: Why is China more outstanding in its economic growth than a having political figures like in Europe and the US?I think a combination of several elements: historical trend, the call of an uncertain and changing world, a robust and rapid domestic development of China.First, the historical trend, at the right time, the former leader Deng Xiaoping implemented the reform and opening up policy and set China’s developing goals for several decades; again at the right time, President Xi Jinping came into power, it’s yet too early to say that he “has saved” China, but for sure he has saved the Communist Party of China before it gets too corrupted and be overturned by its people. These are two men who see clearly the historical trend and have the sense of calling to direct the nation onto the right path.With China’s reform and opening up policy, and integrated with the globalism wave in the past 4 decades, China grasped most of the opportunities to develop itself, to upgrade its infrastructure, its sharpen its sci-tech innovation, to better its social governance, to provide better life for its people......And when time goes into 21 century, when the world is entangled by the financial crisis, when the world is threatened by terrorism, when the Middle East is dragged into a battle field of a “mini-world-war,” when the Europe is cumbered with debt problems and suffering the agony brought by refugees, when the USA, our world leader, is almost torn apart by its internal party division and social division......nations across the world need a comparatively stable, safe and promising place to do business with. Against this backdrop, Xi Jinping proposed the Belt and Road Initiative (B&R) and welcomed all nations to take a ride on the fast developing train of China.And domestically, the one central government led by one-ruling-party mode, though criticized and even denounced by many Western governments, is unarguably one of the most efficient and effective governance methods of turning policies into practices. China’s huge population, vast territory, rich natural resources, etc., are also favorable conditions for its economic growth. Chinese people, who are clever, diligent, and have strong abilities of endurance and control, are capable of finding a well balance between striving for their own dreams and following the government’s policies, hence driving the economic growth.",12,0.18741968557758035,0.3735626946153262,0.8645350786118171

543,"Because China doesn’t have elections.This means that the ruling Chinese Communist Party can plan and implement policies which are not affected by party politics, and can take the long view.Democracy and party politics are highly fractious, which means that there is disagreement and fighting over growth and economic policies along party lines. In party politics, a lot of time and energy is wasted over implementing and undoing the previous administration’s policies. Just look at all the energy Trump has put into undoing Obama administration policies!This makes it impossible to implement a consistent long-term growth policy.In China there is no debate, for example, over undoing and redoing healthcare policy. The central government has general guidelines, and it is pushed down to the provincial and municipal governments for implementation, and if they don’t do it, they have to tell the central government reasons why it was not done in the prescribed time. If that happens, some officials get fired, and replaced with new officials. It’s that simple.When a single party has control over national resources and a single vision, and has tight party discipline and control over the society, it can afford to think over the long-term, and then implement its plans.Democracy has certain advantages. It works best in a world where there is limited competition, and ties with outside countries are limited.

545,"In the democratic countries the people elect their leaders. Of course the process is easy to be hacked: demagogues can collect many votes by pleasing the people with popular lies; the citizens are not always mature enough to vote for those who represent the best interest of the country and themselves. This is a major problem with the system (and propaganda organs of the autocratic regimes frequently use this as a powerful argument for the legitimacy of the omnipotent, oppressive rule of their ruling class). Still, in the democratic countries there are independent organs (“checks and balances”) to restrict the power of the ruling elite, thus ensuring certain stability.In China the people have no word in electing their leaders. In fact China does not have national leaders, China is in “state capture”: there is a group (the Chinese Communist Party = CCP) who has omnipotent power over China; the CCP declares the access of any other groups to power as illegal; the CCP selects its own officials and leaders via an intransparent, obscure inner protocol, the details of which is not public; and the leaders of the CCP are automatically considered as national leaders of the state of China. E.g., the general secretary of the CCP (currently Mr. Xi Jinping) also automatically fulfils the position of the paramount leader of China (the position was called “chairman” earlier, the Chinese propaganda organs prefer to call it “president” recently, but it is the same function). The situation is somewhat similar to the fact that China does not have a national army either, the CCP has its own private army (the People’s Liberation Army = PLA), and in some cases it may order the army to stand up for national interest, but it does not change the fact that the primary goal of the PLA and the primary reason of its existence is to protect the interest of the CCP, and not of China. The interest of the CCP and China sometimes overlap, sometimes do not.As the leaders of the CCP are elected by the CCP, and not the people, they are not accountable by the people. They primarily represent the interest of the CCP, and not the people (the two sometimes overlap, sometimes not). This is why in China the citizens do not have the right to question or criticize the CCP: the CCP does not represent them but they represent its own interest, therefore the only “right” the citizens have is to accept and agree the CCP’s decisions.The CCP was not elected by the people; the CCP represents its own interest and not the people’s interest; the power of the CCP is unrestricted; and it maintains its power by considerable oppression. Because of this, the legitimacy of the CCP is very low. CCP needs to provide an explanation why they are holding the power monopolistically. In the past few years they started to prove their legitimacy by calling their rule as meritocracy: they claim that the people are excluded from the power because China follows the strategy of electing the national leaders according to their merits, the most able, most excellent, most potent people are selected for leader. This is, of course, merely a propaganda slogan to silent the voices who demand political participation. The selection process of the CCP leaders and officials is intransparent, nothing is known about its protocol, but one thing is sure: there is fierce inner fight within the Party, and generally the most aggressive one wins. During the last transfer of leadership, we witnessed the personal battle of Xi Jinping and Bo Xilai for power. Finally Xi won, and he could successfully remove Bo from the whole political arena by sending him into prison. In the beginning it seemed equally likely that Bo will win, in this scenario Xi would sit in the prison now, stigmatized as corrupt, and Bo would play the role of “remarkably moral leader”, probably he would be “core leader”, the “Bo Xilai Thought” would be included in the Chinese Constitution, and it would be Bo (and not Xi) who is referred in the Chinese propaganda organs as “the Helmsman of the Socialist Nation with Chinese Characteristics in the New Era, the Guide of the People, the Core of the Party, Commander of the Army, and Leader of the People, Who Is Supported by the Whole Party, Loved, and Respected by the People” etc. etc.The best indication of the inner fight for power within the Party is that after he became Paramount Leader Mr. Xi immediately started to solidify his power, eradicate any potential opposition, and ensure that he won’t be able to be removed after finishing his legal term. Just a few months ago he effectively removed any obstacles before himself to remain in power as long as he wishes. The obvious reason of it is that during the first five years of his regime he purged many Chinese officials who belonged to opponent fractions of the Party; and he knows well that as soon as he will lose his power, probably the next leader will be after him, and he would easily end up in prison. In the free countries if you are declared as corrupt you will lose your power; in China if you lose your power you will be declared as corrupt. And of course it would be very easy to collect evidence for Xi’s corruption crimes. It was hardly a coincidence that the very first step of Xi after grabbing power was to remove and imprison the former head of the Secret Police, Zhou Yongkang — the person who probably had an overwhelming amount of evidence against Xi; the reason of this is more than obvious.As the leader of China is selected in such a way, there is little surprise that usually not the most able and most outstanding people get into leader positions (again Mr. Xi is the best example). It is the same as in the democratic countries; the big difference is, however, that in the democratic countries at least there are some legal ways, whilst in China there is no legal way to remove the leaders.",18,0.18736737504919318,0.45781477108749835,0.9980296889206776
546,"Your assumption is plain wrong.China doesn’t have a meritocratic system, meritocracy is merely a brainchild of some CCP shills on this site.Xi Jinping becomes the president of China not because he outperformed his competitors, on the contrary, he made no achievement when he worked as a governor in Fujian, Zhejiang and Shanghai. If he was not the son of Xi Zhongxun, Xi Jinping should have zero chance to be “elected” as a member of politburo no matter how able he is.Currently the Chinese state controlled news “media” are extolling Xi Jinping to the skies pretty much like North Korean “media” claiming Kim Jong-Un is the greatest leader in the world.

547,"Other posters have commented on whether China is a meritocracy and I have nothing to add. I’ll add a different perspective.Imperial China after Tang dynasty actually had a meritocratic system, as regular examinations are held to choose government officials based on exam scores, and officials were promoted based on his performance. If meritocracy is such a good thing, why did imperial dynasties still collapsed afterwards? Was it simply because some emperor was a bad leader? It’s not quite so simple.Meritocracy is good as long as the relevant qualities are being measured meaningfully. To take an extreme example, suppose someone watched a lot of racing, saw a lot of winners drove red cars, concluded that the ‘merit’ of a racing contestant is how red his car is, and placed his bet accordingly. Is he going to win most bets?As societies change, the set of qualities of a successful leader may change over time. So even if China is a meritocracy now, the standard of merit may become outdated in a few decades as China changes. And who will change the standard? Relying on someone who succeeded on a different set of standards to change the standard is not very reliable, and there will be a lot of push-back from the establishment.",4,0.106,0.40636263736263734,0.9617653219231849

The only politburo standing committee member who was convicted in court.No, I do not mean that he is ‘bad’ because he is convicted. He may be corrupt, guess who is not; and he may be tyrannical, and so are many leaders of his stature in China. These are vices, but are they bad?

But he strangely punished police officers on ordinary law enforcement actions IF a complaint is filed, many times by thugs. This strange dual standard is the major cause of so many weird phenomenon in China - thugs bullying or even killing doctors for legitimate treatments, traffic policemen verbally abused or even beaten for routine traffic check up, and passengers trashing the airport and beating airline staffs for flight delays.In a supposedly autocratic or even authoritarian state, strangely no one, particularly thugs, is afraid of policeman. Medical schools found it hard to recruit top high school graduates because they are worried about their personal safety after they graduate, policeman dare not use force promptly on violent thugs that bystanders and even they themselves are hurt, and some Chinese have even carried their bad temper to foreign airports based on their own experience or perception in China.I cannot explain why he behaved as such, and whatever justifiable motivations of his decisions. Everyone can see the disastrous consequence of 10 years of his rule in law enforcement in China.So I guess this answers your question: yes, it is possible for China’s leader selection process to produce ‘bad’ leaders, because there is at least one big example.",2,-0.11956632653061224,0.5600850340136054,0.9767793689360813

561,"All of such comparisons are meaningless. You want to compare the economy of a developing country with a population of 1.4 billion with that of a developed country of 5.5 million? One with 9.6 million km², the other about 700 km², merely a large city therefore with nearly lacking agriculture? The economies of these countries are historically and structurally completely different. Of course it is possible to compare certain aspects of the two, but you cannot say “which is better”. Which is better, a Harley Davidson, or a Boeing 777? “The Harley cannot fly, so the Boeing is better!” “You cannot ride a Boeing on one wheel so Harley is better!” Is there any sense in such comparisons?Chinese are very much obsessed with comparing their economy and other achievements to those of other countries, and frequently use the numbers as tools of political propaganda. Which is more democratic, China or USA? USA is democratic, well, let’s say China is democratic too, only in a different way from USA, because we MUST be better than the USA in all respect! Which is better, Chinese or American economy? Chinese or Japanese? We must beat the damned Japs to demonstrate our superiority! Chinese or Taiwanese (oh pardon, Mainlandchinese or Taiwanprovinceofpeoplesrepublicofchinachinese)? We must be better in everything! Ha! It is possible to find some statistics in which China produces larger figures than Taiwan: great evidence that the mainland government performs better than those poor blindered rebels on our island “province”, cannot they understand that they should reunify! Other statistics we simply ignore.China is very proud of its great nominal GDP, already second of the world, but already first if you use some creative statistics, e.g. PPP. Who cares? Kenya has a bigger GDP than Luxembourg, does it mean that Kenya is more developed, the Kenyan government is doing a better job than the Luxembourg one, or Kenyan citizens enjoy a better life? Do we expect a massive immigration to Kenya from Luxembourg? The same about China. Is there any meaning of comparing the nominal GPD of China with any other country? China has a population 4 times of that of the USA, 11 times that of Japan, 60 times that of Taiwan, 250 times that of Singapore! Is it a big achievement that 10 or 60 or 250 times more people can produce more than a 10 or 60 or 250 times smaller population? (With 25% of its population USA can produce more than China, well, this is something like an achievement.) If you divide the GDP with the population, you will see that China is still decades behind these countries. The per capita GDP of China roughly equals with that of Kazakhstan or Lebanon. OK, let’s count in PPP, it is good for us, because everything is cheap in China! Still, in such a statistics, Gabon, Turkmenistan, Belarus, even Iraq (!) (poor Iraq, recently destroyed by the evil imperialists!) are all above China.OK, the nominal GDP is not good. China is also very proud of the amazing GDP growth, around 6%, 15th place on the world list, wow! Have a look at this table: List of countries by real GDP growth rate. Which are the countries with even higher GDP growth? Libya, Ethiopia, Vietnam, Ivory Coast, India, Iraq, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Djibouti, Cambodia, Laos, Senegal, Nepal. It is obvious: the poorer the country, the higher the GDP growth is. It is easy to double your GDP if you are in the process of coming out from the stone age. Poor Norway and Switzerland with their 1% growth, it is surprising why don’t the local people revolt against their incompetent government and introduce a Maoist-style “People’s Democratic Dictatorship”, huh? (Macau is on the list too, with very high GDP growth — after a 26% plunge in 2015, so again, the high growth is natural.)Poor Taiwan has a GDP growth of about 2%, ridiculous, not? But 30 years ago it also had about 5–10% growth. With the development of Taiwan it decreased to the present 2%. Well, China is now approximately where Taiwan was 30 years ago. Decrease of the GDP growth with the economic development is a common phenomenon, and be sure that the very same will happen to China in the foreseeable future. (We are already about halfway in this process!) There is nothing bad in it. The only problem is if you put the GDP growth as some kind of fetish, therefore if you cannot produce the promised numbers you will erode your own credibility and destroy your own legitimation. If you tell fairy tales that the 6% growth of GDP will last forever due to the professionalism of the government, therefore 50 years later your economy will be 10 times bigger than that of the USA and EU combined — this could easily backfire. Such claims must be immediately suspicious for those who still can remember that the GDP growth of China was close to 20% in the 1970’s and still high above 10% in the 1980’s-1990’s, even slightly above 10% a decade ago.(Many experts say that the 6% “official” growth communicated by the Party is entirely fabricated, and the real number is around 2% already. Well, THAT would be quite bad: at least many other countries could become rich before decreasing their GDP growth to this level, whilst in this situation China failed to do so, it is still a developing country. Let’s hope it is not true, or at least that the Party can successfully continue hiding the truth from at least from its own citizens.)",11,0.11493874807987706,0.5086266001024066,0.4910680769357242

But all things come to an end. At the moment though, the CCP’s institutional entrenchment in society and politics, investment in state security, and performance legitimacy makes this unlikely.The second has happened before, usually as a direct consequence of the first.

To quote the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, 分久必合，合久必分 - that which is long divided must unite, long united, must divide.The third type of collapse, I believe, is seemingly much more impossible. China as a civilizational and cultural idea and entity has survived the tests of millennia. The Mongols and the Manchu conquered the Song and the Ming militarily and subjugated them politically, but over time even they were absorbed and assimilated by the more sophisticated culture of the Han, adopting Chinese fashion, titles, habits, and education.

580,"It is important to remark that communism is not an economic system, but a political scheme, whose purpose, theoretically, is to create conditions of equal opportunities and rights for all inhabitants who are under that regime of government. Regrettably and paradoxically, in all the countries where ""communism"" was established, there was a shortage of material resources available to distribute equitably among the population. Countries such as China, Russia, Vietnam, Albany, Cuba, Cambodia, etc. have undergone (and still some continue under) this political system. The obvious question is ""What can be distributed in the midst of so much scarcity and poverty?""Karl Marx, in his masterpiece: ""Das Kapital"", questions the exploitation of man by man, because that scheme generates a ""surplus value"", that is, a profit or the result of production, which ends up in the hands of the capitalist, who owns the means of production and, therefore, the owner appropriates the surplus of production, instead of promoting an equitable distribution in the relation between labor and capital. Consequently, it is capital that determines the domination of the system; that system of appropriation that subsists until our days; since the owner of capital will never give up the benefits of his money gives him; while work is seen as a commodity (a product to be sold; human beings do not matter) that is bought according to supply and demand. Today, there is too much demand for work, therefore salaries fall and fall to limits often insufficient for a decent subsistence.All the countries called communists undertook their ""revolution"" to overthrow the regime they considered alien to the interests of the majority and with the illusion of a parity or equitable distribution of the goods generated by a country. However, equity has not occurred in any country of the so-called ""communist orbit"". Rather, a caste of bureaucrats was formed in all of them, ultimately replacing the ""owners of the means of production,"" the ""feudal lords,"" the ""oligarchy,"" the ""monarchy."" reproducing almost exactly the same relations of privileges that prevailed over the common interest.Well, I'm not going to spread in all the vices that communism has generated where it has been applied, because the question is how does the economic system work in China? As it is known, in China a ""state capitalism"" was settled down, that is, the State was the absolute owner of the means of production and profits. There was a complete centralization of power and a central planning that was responsible for dictating what to produce, and acquiring the production of peasants and workers, and then in turn, distribute them through ""rationing tickets"" by productive units, communes or families; while the power of the authorities members of the Chinese Communist Party was strengthening at maximum.This stage of development ended with the beginning of the ""economic reform"" proposed by Deng Xiaoping. In a country as gigantic as China, to assume the change from one system to another was very hazardous and uneven. But it was achieved thanks to the legitimacy of the CCP and its total control of the country. That legitimacy allowed the Communist Party to decree the following statement: ""From now on, everyone must manage to get their own rice bowl."" That slogan created two types of reactions: in favor, because the Chinese with productive, commercial and economic skills were going to enjoy ""economic freedom"", and against, because many Chinese were accustomed to the state dependence and were not able to generate their own businesses.Consequently, the era in which the State should employ the entire population is over. Today, there are private Chinese capitalists (and billionaires) who own their own fortunes. They pay their taxes, and they have the freedom to market inside and outside the country. Many people mistakenly believe, under the influence of international media, that China developed thanks to foreign investment. However, the statistics on the subject stand alone: ​​the biggest investors in China, when the Chinese reform began, were the Chinese people of Taiwan, Hong Kong, Chinese communities in San Francisco, London, Canada and Australia. Certainly, the Chinese relied on the Chinese mainland citizens themselves.Finally, in good conscience, China is the only country in the world that is politically communist and economically capitalist.Personally, I have witnessed the exception of having lived and worked in China before and after the economic reform, so I witnessed the changes that China experienced before and continue up to this day.",1,0.1379035409035409,0.38131257631257626,0.9935617841945201

There are also the loan repayment history and even how indebted people are .. etc we can extend these to say “people selling fake goods” “employers cheating on employees’ social securities or refusing to pay overtimes … the list is endlessWe can see some possibly good usage for these especially China is so large and so many people are misbehaving, or cheating others .. people need to be protected.Imagine how hard it is for the e-shopping providers and customers to control the cheating suppliers, the fake goods …etc to be able to tell or rate the honest suppliers, or the good foods/restaurants.. etc. . .China is actually quite advanced in many areas like e-shopping, ‘big data’, e-payment .. etc more advanced that perhaps some people who do not live in China can imagine.

If we were able to channel the available resources toward the development of MSME's, we too can strengthen our manufacturing base. However there are certain hindrances that needs to be dealt with to unleash the true potential of our secondary sector-1.) China's economic boom primarily owes to it's sophisticated infrastructure. India too need to strengthen the infrastructural facilities like road, rail connectivity, inland waterways, water and electricity facilities.2.) Unlike in China, land acquisition for establishment of industries was not an easy task in India. However with the latest LARR act, everyone hopes that this barrier is no more.3.)

606,"I’ll take this one part at a time.I’m not sure if the majority of US citizens think that the Chinese economy would be completely crippled by the US “sanctions” (BTW America is a continent, not a country)I however have lived in China and I am currently living in the US, and have noticed an average ignorance about each other in the general population. Both are quite economically powerful countries, and both would be affected to an extent in the case of a trade war, but the majority of the people in each of them tend to believe the official stories.I would like to point out that as of today, there are no sanctions but tariffs. And they are being imposed to a set of products, for strategic purposes. They intend to eliminate the economic efficiency gain of producing them in China instead of your own country.Other responses correctly point out that you cannot fully replace such a major customer with existing ones, and there is no other hidden big customer country pending to be found. Therefore, the rest of the world cannot be a substitute for a total loss of the USA as a customer, even if we are talking about a number of products.They have however not mentioned that, as in all relationships, there are mutual interests. When you are buying something, while is true that you can decide to do with your money as you please, there is always a reason why you choose to exchange your dollars for something that you may conceivably be able to make yourself. In this case the reason is efficiency, and disrupting the current global trade (promoted initially by the USA, I should remind) will not be cost-less for either party.At this point, it does not appear to be a full out trade war, so I cannot see the Chinese economy coming completely down. If however the tariffs and other protectionist measures have a large enough effect, retaliation will surely ensue, beyond the immediate scope of the trade items being affected. And it is also true that 1/3 of the US public debt is in Chinese hands. The effect that China can have in the US economy will be larger than just the trade: even if they do not sell what they have, but just stop buying Treasury bonds, will be a de-facto removal of 1/3 of the government lenders, which the US cannot replace without a significant cost.Both countries have large, proud, hard-working populations. On the other hand, said populations are accustomed to a living standard, and affecting it will eventually create political consequences, which will translate in a change in policies. While each country’s people may not have a clear understanding of the other one, they will surely have an opinion and clear understanding of their own personal economies, which as Bill Clinton said, is the centerpiece of decision making.",4,0.11605339105339102,0.4489628427128428,0.9268710792533605
607,"Yes .And what is more the USA is one of the few Countries in the world that has it’s own Resources (coal, gas, minerals, grain , beef, population, etc) to be completely self sufficient in production of the goods and service its people require.So putting a tariff on Chinese goods will just force the Americans to start making the stuff China sells them now (albeit at a higher Cost due to the Labour component).So any Trade War means the USA will pay more for these goods but they do have the means to replace Chinese made goods with American made ones very very quickly. Picture how quickly the USA ramped up production after Pearl Harbor.Your statement saying China losing that share of their market (the USA) would be offset by selling Chinese goods to the rest of the world is inaccurate too.China would suffer badly economically as the rest of the world would not provide sufficient demand to replace the Chinese market into the USA. If that market was there now China would be selling to them already you make but you can’t make people to buy more goods.By the way - the other Country with both the population and natural resources to be self sufficient is Russia but they are not efficient in production yet in most Industries (the USSR suffered that the same problem for decades). The equipment, tools etc in Russia look pretty basic when you see their Industries.As China will never be self sufficient because it relies on Trade for raw materials, (minerals, iron ore, bauxite , just about everything it uses to make its manufactured goods) .So yeah China would lose a Trade War with the USA bigtime and if the economy dives the Chinese people suffer bigtime.",2,0.15357905982905984,0.37131410256410263,0.9947321413855933

612,"Have you heard of the Pharoh Narmer?They’re literally not sure when he lived, nor what exactly he did during his life, nor where his body is buried. Yet he is considered part of Egyptian history.Why?because some ancient Egyptians wrote something down!That’s the basis of “history” in a nutshell. There are times when you can, via archaeology, find things that date back to a certain time and thus know for sure X has existed by Y. Most of the time, however, you have to rely on written records.In Mesopotamia, we have the King Gilgamesh.Again, we don’t know when he lived exactly. We’ve never found the body, and all we have are myths of his time on Earth.Doesn’t stop anybody from considering him as historical and for Mesopotamian history to stretch back at least 4500 years, if not more.Only China is subject to this higher standard of “Oh we don’t have hard archaeological evidence, must mean that stuff prior to the Shang Dynasty is fake”!The Irony of it all is, this was instigated by Chinese deniers of the late Qing Dyansty-early Republican era, a school known as Doubting Antiquity School.What’s their story? they saw that China had been weakened and put at the mercy of foreign power despite being the oldest civilization to still be running in one piece. They tried to reconcile this by attempting to deny this heritage, reducing what China was most proud for and the basis in its own perceived superiority.If China couldn’t claim that its history stretches back before Western civilization was a thing, then there’s no reason why China should hold onto those traditions instead of embracing Western ones. That was the aim of this school, to try to drag China into the modern era by force.The funny thing is. At the inception of this school, they tried to argue that the Shang Dynasty itself was fake (or at least grossly exaggerated). The discovery of oracle bones and other archaeological evidence that closely matched the historical narrative that they so blithely dismissed only made them dig their heel in deeper. They argued that even if the Shang was real, the preceding Xia Dynasty must be made up. For the most part, archaeology has not yet caught up to that point.Again, however, parallel civilizations elsewhere in the world have about just as good of an archaeological record as China, but we don’t go around doubting their claims to their years of history as we do China.The reason for that? Western Sinologists all subscribe to the Doubting antiquity school to a certain degree. And those ideas get distilled into the public via poorly-researched and written textbooks and world history curriculum meant to give students a taste without making their brains melt and ooze out of their ears about how big the world actually is.",348,0.035271023302938194,0.37065180682201965,0.9947332531968404
613,"There are three different matters buried here in one question:What is proven history? History is often referred to as the written record, and everything before that is termed prehistory. In that case, the oldest verified samples of writing in what is now China are indeed about 3,700 years old. Older inscriptions, which may or may not be a writing system, have been discovered that are 5,000 years old (source:China discovers primitive, 5,000-year-old writing that may be among oldest in the world - NY Daily News). The exciting thing about Chinese history is the rate of archaeological discoveries since the 1970s and the dramatic finds that are being made. It is an exciting time to be interested in Chinese history!Not all historians subscribe to the idea that historical information can only be derived from written records. The sophistication of other methods of inquiry has greatly expanded what we can learn from non-written sources, allowing us to learn how people lived who are not included in the historical record (e.g., the poor, minorities, women, the vanquished vs. the victors who usually write history, the illiterate, etc.). This applies both to the periods for which we have written records and for the periods prior to that. As such, we are learning a great deal about the human societies that lived in what is now China. This history is quite ancient, but incompletely known. Genetic evidence suggests groups of humans began arriving in the area 50–60,000 years ago, with the beginning of agriculture 10,000 years ago. Early hominids date from much farther back, with the oldest evidence of control of fire by hominids dating to a site in Shanxi Province (Control of fire by early humans - Wikipedia). There is much more to go into about the early history of what is now China and the many disparate groups and early cultures.Finally, is all of this the history of “China”? In other words, how old is Chinese culture and the Chinese state? The longstanding list of Chinese dynasties begins with the Xia, continues with the Shang, and so on. As others have noted, both of these were considered legendary or mythological. However, historic evidence for the Shang is now incontrovertible. We will see what happens to the Xia as further work is done. But this “history” begs the question of what is Chinese. The territory has always been populated by a mix of peoples. A good many dynasties, including the early ones, were not “Han” Chinese (a nice anachronistic name, that). The construct “Han” or “Tang” Chinese is a nationalist endeavour that has been under way for thousands of years. That it has been successful is evidenced by the question and the argument: is it Chinese? Chinese is like saying Iranian or Indian or American.

There is no universal agreement regarding what constitutes a written artifact, however most historians agree that the Kish tablet - Wikipedia is among the oldest known written artifacts.

If we agree that proto-cuneiform is a form of writing, then the Kish tablet is the first historical document. Anything before that belongs by definition to pre-history.There is a consensus among historians that drawings or painting do not constitute script. The oldest known paintings were non-figurative and made by Neanderthals more than 60,000 years ago in Spain.

Some of these date from 6600BC. Some of these symbols strikingly resemble modern-day ideograms, like those for the Sun.

618,"Because this is the common practice in the field of western history.In reality, there are no much credible historical documents before 1000 AD in the Europe continent survived to day. So strictly speaking, Europe only has a history about 1000 years. All the historical narratives regarding Europe before 10th century are reconstructed based on archaeological findings, or in a more blunt way of wording, falling into the scope of archaeology rather than history.Up to 841 BC, China’s history is well recorded year by year, and confirmed by archaological findings, of high confidence level.From 841 BC further back, China’s history becomes vague because earlier historic events were recorded during times considerably later than the actual times when those events happened. Records of China’s history in this period are a mixture of copies of further earlier historical records which didn’t survive, recordings of legends and hearsays, and reasoning and interpretation of earlier events by those who recorded. Archaeological sites falling in this time period are abundant in China. Erlitou, a site dated back around 1,700 BC, conforms historical records best. However, since no scripts was found in the site, we can’t be 100% certain whether Erlitou really is the Xia capital of 3,700 years old mentioned in historical records. This is where the controverseries arise. If you put all the questions aside and accept the official conclusion that Erlitou really is the capital of Xia dynasty, then ancient records of Xia dynasty has been confirmed and can be considered reliable, thus China’s history being able to trace back as early as 4800 years, roughly 5000 years.In conclusion, although strictly speaking , China has a history of only about 3000 years, if you accept an European history of 3,000 or even 4,000 years with ancient Greece and Rome in mind, then nothing is wrong for Chinese government to claim that China has a history of 5000 years.I know, some people would disagree with my opinion regarding European history and bring up ancient Rome and Greece.

620,"What is the difference between Germany's industry 4.0 plan and China's Made in China 2025 plan so that the Trump administration considers the China plan a threat, but not the German plan?LOL, you know, if in the blockbuster disaster movie 2012 (film) - Wikipedia, the one who was tasked to build the Ark to save humanity was not the Chinese doing it in the Himalayas, but the Germans doing it in the Alps, then maybe, just maybe, the one who is now in Mr. Trump’s sight will be Germany’s “Industrie 4.0"", 'cause it's been reported that movies and TV shows are where the President gets his ideas from.Jokes aside, although both plans are for the digitization of production, I would agree with Mr. Volker Hetzer here that the Chinese plan is more likely to work, because China has tremendous domestic need to get it done, while for Germany, it’s mostly a marketing term.China’s population is aging rapidly. The 60+ population is expected to rise from 230 million today to over 400 million by 2050. If you want to know how an aging society will put enormous strains on the economy, just look at Japan! The Chinese State Council has mandated that all the elderly must have guaranteed food, housing, pension, healthcare, and social engagement/activities. The only way for this to work is that the shrinking labor force must become more productive. Ditto “Made in China 2025”, freshly baked in 2015. You don’t need any abstract thinking. You just need to go out and take a stroll in Beijing’s street, and take a look at all the passers-by, and think where they will be in 20 years, and you just know you have to do this. AI everything. There is literally no other alternative, and there’s NOTHING Mr. Trump can do to change that, other than offering to take care of, say, 200 million Chinese elderly for the Chinese government. How likely is that? So China will plow ahead with “Made in China 2025” no matter what.Germany’s “Industrie 4.0” came from a different genesis. It was first proposed in Hannover Messe, which is the biggest trade show for industrial technology, in 2011. So you know what “industrial technology” is, right? Basically, if you want to make shoes to sell to consumers, here I have a shoe-making machine that I want to sell to you. OK, then, here is “Industrie 4.0” with the new fancy production machines. You see, you are not under-the-gun over an impending giant social issue. You have essentially the same motivation as the Pentagon wanting to build F-35. It maybe a great machine, but you are not really making it to save your butt. You are making it to sell to some dudes for money. That … kinda changes the perspective of things.Lo-and-behold, the two industrial plans took on drastically different development paths. The Chinese went on a maniacally-focused path of hands-on work, quality-improvement, and mass-innovation, with annual goals and targets to meet, madeinchina2025. It has a big direct consumer-facing elements, from drone delivery to unmanned retail, while the Germans went on a path to try to negotiate industry standards with everybody else under the sun. Implementation of an Industry 4.0 Strategy - The German Plattform Industrie 4.0 Even got the Italians on-board with their 13 billion euro tax credit for Piano Nazionale Industria 4.0, for things like better olive oil bottling. I’m not laughing at it, but putting a wi-fi in the middle of a production floor, to avoid paying some taxes, is really not a New Industrial Revolution!I don’t know how seriously President Trump is treating the Chinese plan as a threat. Made in China 2025 calls for 70% self-sufficiency in key high-tech areas, and Mr. Trump said, in order to show you HOW WRONG you are to aspire to this, I’m going to yank your chip supply so that you’ll go bankrupt immediately! US hits major Chinese tech firm with export ban Well, what do you think will happen? The Chinese government of course turned around, and told all of their domestic industries: “See, this is what happens when you don’t have at least partial self-sufficiency! What happens if it’s your aged parents on the other side of some high-tech med device that the US just banned? Watching them die? Now let’s all get back to work, and work faster!”I’ve said this before - the way to “win” a trade war, is not to weaponize trade in the first place.

636,"China has managed to pull off an economic miracle of creating sustained multi-decade economic growth for over 1 billion people for one principal reason, which is creation of domestic capital at unprecedented scale.Take a look at the following amazing chart:China’s bank assets are now the largest in the world, surpassing all of the EU and almost double the size of the US. Note that it took hundreds of years for the US and the top countries in the EU to reach such levels of wealth. It took China, a country ruled by a single party, to do it in about 30.Where did all this capital come from? Contrary to popular myths and beliefs, it was NOT directly from the trade surpluses accumulated during the years. Their foreign reserves have been steady and actually declining in recent years:In any case, those reserves have been sitting unspent on the balance sheet of the People’s Bank of China. They pulled off their economic miracle by using these reserves as a base for generating tens of trillions of dollars worth of domestic capital in their banking system, through the magic of banking leverage based on fractional reserve systems.30 trillion dollars is an absurdly high number that is very hard to put in perspective. So let us consider some examples.There is about 47,000 miles of interstate highways in the US. At about $2M/mile, it would take less than $100B to rebuild them all from scratch! As of 2017, China had about 135,000 kilometers, or 85,000 miles of expressways, having surpassed the US in 2011.It takes a $3–5B to build a modern world-class airport for a large city. Take 200 (!) of those built from scratch, brand new, and we are still at only $1 trillion.How about thousands of skyscrapers, many thousands of miles of high-speed railways, not to mention countless plants and factories? All that is reflected in those $30T of China’s banking assets.China did this unprecedented wealth creation from domestic capital, which is a feat managed by only a few of the richest countries in all of history. Those willing to reach such heights should be smart to follow their path of building wealth by creating domestic capital.",308,0.11045315795315795,0.4583613608613608,0.8722360573762913
637,"Accurately, it should be 40 years growth. Three major reasons contributed to the continues growth.First, Government dominate the investment of many infrastructures. All of the decision of investment were very quick. Government can easily finance the projects like highway, airport, electricity network, etc. from the bank, most of which actually owned by the nation. The massive construction stimulated the relevant sector booming. You could see the production of steel, cement, coal in China are typically are far beyond that of any other country. Chinese family typically dislike any loan or debt, they deposit most their earnings in bank. That means central bank don't need print too much money to fund the investment. As a result, the inflation in China is quite healthy in most of time.Second, China became open and shift to a free market economy since 1978. Government offered many attractive policy for Foreign Direct Investment(FDI). With the multinational companies came to China, Chinese learnt how to play in a market economy. At the same time, Government loose the control over many sectors, like real estate, manufacture, etc. Then, private-owned enterprises became legal since 1978. Then, many of small and medium size companies played very import role in 1980's. Some of them grew quite big now. Lenovo is a good example.Third, the population is another import factor. Mao encouraged Chinese family raise children as much as possible. Back to 1978, Typical Chinese family has 5 or more child, and most of the children is under 25. They became rich source of cheap labour. In addition, education is top priority in most of Chinese family, even they are poor, they manage to get the child access to good education. Since 1990's, universities in China enlarged their enrollment and the graduated student became very high quality labour later. With the cheap, young and quality labour, the companies in China could hire good employee with very low cost before 2010's. Recently, the labour cost in China is not cheap any more, but the quality actually quite good. The well-educated labour contributed to several giants successful in high-tech field, like Alibaba, Tencent, Xiaomi, etc.Of course, there are lot of problem in China. The biggest one is pollution. In the past 40 years, both Governments and private capital just pursue the return of investment. Little of them care about social responsibility. The hazard smog in Beijing push the authority realize the environmental problem. Another one is very high property price in China. In past 20 years, huge amount of private capital flushed into real estate section. With the booming of the sector, the house expense became the heavy burden for young people.

He moved China away from Soviet style economic planning. His leadership combined with massive state support, a humongous population, fundamental authoritarianism, and outside assistance & investment helped creating the economic giant that you see today. China’s economy can be described as a mixture of mercantilism and markets. The amount of government interference in private businesses is much worse than Western nations and other Asian countries such as Singapore, Japan, and South Korea.

Contributing to the explosion are the already high education level in China and the high savings rate of the individual Chinese family.

This will mean the end of the USA as the financial master of the world.If that happens, China will ask the USA to give them their money back (and so will Russia). Problem is, the US doesn’t have the money to pay their debts. The USA owns 23 trillion to other countries. It used to be only 17 trillion only a few years ago, so it grows at an exponential rate. So it is essential for the US to make China and Russia stop doing what they are doing. Hence all these wars in the Middle East and the Korean peninsula.So, you see, it’s not about “freedom” and “democracy”. It’s about money and only money.

687,"There is a very minimal chance but still there are lots of things that can go wrong. Some problems that we are about to face this century might change economic conditions.First of all it can be that global demand doesn’t pick up and the government debt bubble bursts in the west. If this happens then western economies will shrink and demand might take a long time to recover to current levels.Water crisis may change the agricultural prowess of china and food scarcity and freshwater problem in urban areas might abruptly stop economic growth.Oil runs out and china the biggest consumer by then, faces a energy crisis.Climate change affects agricultural yields, leading to food scarcity.Altough these scenarios will be faced by the Chinese population surely, what effects it has or how the CCP react or prepare for it varies.

688,"Yes there is a realistic chance. In 2017, the US had a nominal GDP of 19.3 trillion, China 12 trillion. China is growing quicker than America, if you believe the CCP’s questionable statistics.However, consider this. Last year, America grew by over 2%, China by close to 7%. Yet the USD appreciates last year. So last year, for the first time since 1999, in USD terms, the US grew faster than China. So the gap didn't close last year.Moreover, China demographic crisis means it grow rate ill fall to 4%-5% relatively soon, with America’s at 2%-3%. That means even a small depreciation to the USD, will mean that in nominal GDP terms, the gap won’t close quickly.Finally, longer-term, there are two things that are likely to stop China. Firstly India will overtake China in terms of population. The only reason China has a high GDP is its population, but it will lose that advantage soon. By 2100, India may be the biggest economy in the world.Importantly too, China has a much less stable government system, longer-term. Don't confuse lack of volatility (China) with stability. More volatile systems will be more stable longer-term. The chance of China going the same way as the USSR longer term is pretty high.",4,0.024166666666666663,0.4583730158730158,0.4120041289614449

690,"The answer lies hidden in the Chinese diaspora. Hard work, a will to succeed, and a craving/drive for business. Deng Xiaoping either knowingly or stumbling across this characteristic in the Chinese race, took the initiative that unleashed this power and it ignited the fire of capitalism within China. It was not the CCP, or the SOE of Communist past, it was the capitalist dream embedded within the Chinese people. Many say the SOE drove the business success, and that is only partly true. It was the dynamics of hard work and the will to succeed that created small private enterprises and large private enterprises that propelled China’s economic success. From the small retail trader in SE Asia of Chinese heritage, to the educated Chinese elite that commands some of Silicon Valley’s tech businesses, Chinese have shown how well they are at business. Now, the Chinese in China have shown that same success to the world.“Financially, SOEs perform worse than private firms. In 2015, private Chinese firms generated 9 percent return-on-assets compared to 5 percent for SOEs (a measure of a firm’s profit, specifically, a firm’s net income as a share of invested capital). This is not some new occurrence, with data showing SOEs poor financial performance, compared to private firms, going back at least 25 years. Metrics that determine long-term economic growth—productivity and innovation—show even more evidence that SOEs do not sustain robust innovation-led economic growth. Private firms not only invest more intensely in innovation activities than SOEs, they are more capable in translating their R&D investments into productivity gains. By analyzing stock market data and annual reports of 1,900 Chinese firms between 2001 and 2011, three economists show the negative drag SOEs have on Chinese innovation. After classifying firms by their ownership structure, they find that as a share of revenue, SOEs invest 0.57 percent into R&D, while private firms invest 0.95 percent into R&D. In other words, private firms are 67 percent more R&D intensive than SOEs. Private firms are not only more R&D intensive than SOEs, they too are better able to translate these R&D investments into productivity growth. Every 1¥ invested in R&D by a private firm returned an additional 0.16¥ in output, while every 1¥ invested in R&D by a SOE returned an additional 0.12¥ in output—approximately a 30 percent difference. China’s own experience with privatizing some SOEs since joining the WTO in 2001 should give them even more reason to fully embrace market-based economic trade policies. A separate economic analysis covering firm data between 1990 and 2013 shows that, on average, when a SOE switched to private ownership, R&D as a share of net assets doubled, or an increase of 0.14 percentage points. This surge in innovative activity also explains why patenting increased by 7.2 percent, which was accompanied by high-quality patents and more collaborative R&D with international companies.” Despite China Favoring State-Owned Enterprises, Its Private Companies are More Innovative and Productive",0,0.0773893855062686,0.3579517344127733,0.8699078507733343
691,"Being a Chinese, I just would like to act friendly and moderate at any occasion as what our inherited philosophy always told me. Even facing some funny logic, I will try my best to keep smile and keep silence.Knowing when to keep silence is some of the highest morality of human being, isn’t it. I mean, for Mr. John Charles Harman, as graduate and BS holder of Kinesiology and Sports, if you are presented full design of something high technology, are you capable to memory it, copy it, produce it, and moreover, develop a further advanced next generation product compare to the original one you see. I know that it is a hard logic for you to understand since that you are the people who will take all the links in your answer as your reference. By the way, do you believe the earth is flat?Take nuclear weapon as an example, China did get help and reference from Soviet Union for developing the very first nuclear bomb. However, when the Sino-Soviet relationship had rip at 1959 which made Soviet Union withdraw all relevant experts, China still produced and successful exploded it in 1964. Not mention, China independently developed its own hydrogen bomb just two years later.Let us back to the question. Sorry for writing long for irrelevant things with the question and cannot bear but write something offensive.The main reason or say you can credit most things of China’s economy growth to China Communist Party. I know that we can assume if there was another party ruling China, would it do a better job and also CCP did make some big mistakes during its 69-years ruling. However, history is history, we will have to admit that it is under CCP’s lead and policies that present you nowadays China. Also you can sing a song of praise to high endurance and hard work Chinese people.If we just talk the right things which CCP did:Land Revolution (Mao)All the wars just after PRC established and develop nuclear weapon (Mao)Insist on establish a integrated industrial system (which was against Stallin’s will) (Mao)Eliminate illiteracy (Mao)Open and reform policy (Deng)Commercialization Reform and cut of dying state-owned sectors (Jiang)Joining WTO (Jiang) (China made a huge concession to US which made US cannot refuse such favored agreement with China and China representative, Zhu Rongji, prime minister at that time, was called traitor after he signed that agreement.)Etc. (Something may be very important but out of my knowledge)Doing one or two things right is quite normal, however, when you manage a country and can always keep a right direction is not easy. CCP achieved it.About large population, it does contribute to the economy growth like providing demographic bonus (*Do not forget, only free, educated population can become demographic bouns), large domestic market for industrial products, and etc. Meanwhile, it also brought challenge and problems like huge money you will need to improve the life of people, infrastructure, job creation, etc.",1,0.1813516865079365,0.53781498015873,0.9964619223372192
692,"That is a major reason, but not the only one. China had a pragmatic leader in Deng, who realized China’s huge and low cost labor force could be very well used to propel the country forward. Korea, Taiwan and the Asean countries had done the same.He built huge infrastructure like ports, roads, railways, airports, industrial estates and more. He threw open the economy to foreigners who could operate in a capitalistic manner, using low cost almost unlimited labor to produce goods for their markets. He made the rules and the bureaucracy business friendly. He had the advantage of having dictatorial powers, and is one of the rare of that kind who used it benevolently. Aberrations were few and far between.As China kept on getting more prosperous, wages kept on rising. They moved from low paying, low skill jobs to better skilled ones. They had trained their people in relevant skills. Today, China is the 2nd largest applicant for patents in the world, behind America.China still has many levers that are unused. Its farmers have tilling rights but not ownership. They can work as long as their health allows, and after that they have to live on the savings that they have made during their lifetimes by squeezing every penny of discretionary expense. Now imagine, if these farmers are given land titles. When they cannot, or don’t want to continue that work, they can monetize the land and use that money for the rest of their lives. That will create a huge market of over 500 million people (bigger than Europe sans Russia) and domestic demand.The reason the rulers are not doing so is the fright that financially independent people may start demanding liberties and shake the communist party’s dictatorial powers.",4,0.18013322884012545,0.528448275862069,0.9941996221220109

What would be an effective industrial policy for American technological development, as a more positive and less threatening response to Made in China 2025?Education as Industrial Policy is the simplest and most enduring strategy.Innovation needs many things, and most of them come from academia.Fund K-12 abundantly.We need the most knowledgeable, capable, adaptable, principled, skilled citizens in the world. They are the product of K-12 education.Fund the heck out of schools. The Capable should be leaving their private schools and private sector jobs for the chance to be part of something so exciting as preparing the next generations.Public school systems must compete financially with industry for the best educators, learning facilities, and learning technologies.Expand on schools as the social service delivery channel of choice.We get better graduates when kids are consistently fed, homed, and cleaned, and clothed.When they don’t have to leave school for primary medical care.When they have child care, protective services, and mental health services on the spot.Bring the community to the child.Improve the quality of K-12 education.The humanities and the sciences make for better workers, neighbors, and voters.The spirit of not leaving children behind is the right one. Same thing for school districts.Treat teachers much better.For K-12 teachers, fully fund retirement, forgive home loans, and provide other financial benefits. Keep them focused on learning and teaching.Universities, stop treating most of your teachers as second class citizens. If we gave you enough money, could you make sure your teaching assistants, grad students, and contract instructors made enough to live on? Didn’t have to take second or third jobs to make ends meet? Had a real shot at tenure?Free college.Community colleges and university should be free. Other countries do this.Include a basic living stipend while students are in school. More focused on studies than fighting the sleep deprivation of two side jobs.I’m OK with students working in public service jobs during school as a condition of education. Plenty to do.Forgive all student debt. It’s stifling the economy and keeping capable people from returning to school to advance themselves.Expand the capacity of post-high school colleges.Nobody should be turned away from a state college for funds. If you have the grades, you should be accepted.So more classrooms, more instructors, more campuses, more alternatives to the classroom lecture.Prepare for the waves of adult re-education. If 40%+ of all 2020 jobs will be disrupted by technology by 2030, many people will need to learn new skills, myself included. Many of them, multiple times in their lives. Make education reentry easy and enticing.Bring back basic research as a national priority.Scientific discovery comes before commercialization and new industries. So we need more pure, raw science to produce the raw materials for innovation.Fully fund university research at public universities. Make America’s state colleges and universities the best places in the world to understand the universe, extend life, grow homes, and everything else that the many sciences can offer.into the physical, biological, cyber, and social sciences. Debug how science is done so it moves faster and openly.Turn science into solutions, at scale.National Research laboratories for every branch of technology.Use the power of government procurement to drive non-military innovation too.10 gigabit unfiltered symmetrical fiber to the home at $30/month.Targets:half of all households the US in four years,half of all classrooms and public spaces in six years,100% in eight.I’m not shocking you when I say the Internet bridges the Digital Divide.

696,"Thanks for requestMade in China 2015 is a strategic development document that contemplates sharing a portion of what has traditionally been the advantage of western manufacturing - complex high tech production, most modern processes and driving industrial advantages by creating advanced intellectual knowledge.The most valued industrial currency of the day in 2018 is not land or access to natural resources, or cheap energy or physical force - - - It is monetization of new ideas, trade and brain power.The good news is those 3 things are not finite, just as global GDP is not finite either.The issue I see for the US is old man Trump and his acolytes are looking into the mirror of what once was and using that paradigm to colour their thinking.Manufacturing companies still exists but they are slowly but steadily being replaced in the hierarchy of the Global 500 by companies that do not manufacture products. Big oil is no longer king.What the future holds is the growth of services.Walmart, Amazon, banking, AT&T, investment firms, health services, insurance, search engines, etc are the future drivers of economic prosperity.Apple does not manufacture anything, they outsource the mfg to sell a phone that cost $300 to produce and sell it for $800. It is the soft things like design, brands and customer service that make the big bucks and drive the stock market.Industrial policy is not my thing but my observations tell me ….What America is losing out on is its’ brain power.The US public education system constantly under delivers.While US Ivy League universities are largely successful because they buy the best brains from around the world from countries whose education systems deliver much better results.The importation of temporary workers in high tech fields is testimony to the lack of US resources, in the fields that matter the most.Yet the US administration acts to retain lower skill jobs in industries like coal.Even worse when the US political class are so dumb as to welcome protectionist measures with xenophobia based on religion and/or nationality.At this point in time, the US cannot out brain China. Nor can the US stop China from implementing 2025.In 2018 the most advanced instant messaging app world wide is WeChat a Chinese invention that western companies have been trying to emulate its success and functionality for years.2025 says China wants to be leader in NEVs well it’s on the way.

697,"What would be an effective industrial policy for American technological development, as a more positive and less threatening response to Made in China 2025?A2A. The idea that the US doesn’t do industry policy is a myth. The US does industrial policy on a massive scale, and has always done so. http://www.civitas.org.uk/conten...Prior to WWII the US had 40% - 50% tariffs on everything, and it was the most trade-protected countries in the world. After WWII the US championed GATT and later on, the WTO, which opened the markets worldwide, but also put restrictions on how much the US can tariff foreign goods, which drove a change of US industrial policy from tariffs to domestic incentives and subsidies.Take a look at government procurement. Since the 1933 Buy American Act, the US government procurement has been locked down with the most exclusive clauses on supporting domestic industries. Foreign share of America’s procurement market is estimated to be around 2%, which is lower than all other industrial nations. Not EU, not Canada, Not Japan, Not China. In fact, EU directives are specifically designed to avoid “buy domestic” policies.In addition to government procurement, the US has a whole bagful of industrial policies worth $trillions of dollars a year, including:Direct subsidies such as ARRA, which is direct federal contracting with small to medium firms totally $200+ billion a year. industry subsidies such as Federal loan of $65 billion to GM and Chrysler in 2008 - 2009, Export support through NEI, R&D tax credit, state and federal manufacturing subsidies such as the $1.3 billion subsidy Tesla received from Nevada, and the $2 billion subsidy Intel received from Oregon. The top five manufacturing companies are all old established political players. All in manufacturing too: Boeing ($13.17 billion), Alcoa ($5.64 billion), Intel ($3.87 billion), General Motors ($3.49 billion) and Ford Motor Company ($2.52 billion). Long history of government subsidies in agriculture, energy, and military. Government VCs such as the one CIA started, what is it called, In-Q-Tel, whose success triggered an avalanche of other government-backed VCs from the Military and other government agencies. Oh, and let’s not forget the super duper deal of TARP, which provided $2 trillion federal funding to shore up banks. Troubled Asset Relief Program Plus various state and federal tax subsidies.It’s not that the US does’t have an industrial policy. It’s that there are massive number of people benefiting from these procurement, subsidies, and favorable tax policies already, and they are all working quietly behind the scenes to keep the goodies going. So the money you need for any NEW industrial policy - you don’t have it! If you sit back and think about it - the government is not in the business of making money. It doesn’t make the pie. It’s in the business of dividing the pie. So if you want to give a slice of the pie to somebody, you have to take it away from somebody else.And so, who gets the money then? Well, the Congressmen all spend half of their time asking for money, so they’ll call up the ones who can write a check. And who can write a check? The guys with money. Duh. That’s why you can “opine” however you like.

There are a few, who are teaching and presenting good surmises of what constitutes coherent understandings on this matter, and hopefully the human race will find itself more in tune with a logical consensus on what exactly constitutes a “benefit” - but until then, the question cannot be answered coherently. Progress is being made and more and more people are learning how to contemplate these sort of issues.",0,0.313755980861244,0.39760765550239235,0.9598274742781777

709,"China  economy in 2018:—Yet China enters 2018 with robust economic-growth momentum. Despite stresses that we highlighted last year, which have only grown—regional disparities, an aging population, declining heavy-industrial sectors, property bubbles, growth in debt levels, and continuing environmental pollution—China remains slightly ahead of track of its goal to double GDP between 2010 and 2020 and to realize its self-declared ambition to become a “moderately prosperous” country.Given this, how might 2018 unfold?China’s continued international expansion—with bigger bumps in the roadAfter a pause and reset to eliminate outbound investment that the government found frivolous, China Inc.’s outbound investment will resume its upward trajectory in 2018, with a focus on Manufacturing 2025 sectors and Internet-enabled businesses, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things. Many global-scale Chinese companies are still mostly focused in China, and they are impatient to scale elsewhere. The reality is that even in 2017, China’s more mature outbound investors kept moving ahead with strategically relevant investments ranging from computers, aviation, and automotive to wealth management, schools, and healthcare. Many of these more mature investors already have businesses outside China of the scale of a Fortune 500 company, with the ability to raise cash where they need it for investment. Geographically, Brazil, Japan, and the United Kingdom in particular saw increased interest. In 2018, investment in these sectors will continue with a particular emphasis on the service sectors—healthcare, tourism, education, gaming, and similar.The international reach of China’s tech companies and investors grew and grew with myriad, often minority, investments too small to show up in national statistics but that gave companies access to innovative technology and business models to scale in China. In 2018, a lot more attention will be paid to global Chinese investment in these fin-, med-, and edtech and AI start-ups, with political pushback in the United States, leading them to focus more heavily on Israel, Scandinavia, and the United Kingdom. De facto, many Chinese investors will simply assume that they could not get approval for investment in the United States and so won’t try. If US–China economic relations deteriorate significantly, we even might see real pressure to break up deals consummated in years past.Belt and Road will remain the flagship international state-to-state collaboration program for building China-sponsored infrastructure around the world. In 2018, there will be more scrutiny of projects, potentially leading to delays (as with the high-speed rail links in Eastern Europe) but also more projects under way. While in part this will be a result of rebranding existing work under Belt Road, clearly the heads of relevant state-owned infrastructure companies are under strong pressure to deliver real projects as central government in Beijing has become frustrated at the slow pace of project realization. In 2018, multinationals should focus more on what business opportunities result from a port in Kenya, railroad in Hungary, or industrial free-trade zone in Kazakhstan than on gaining a major slice of the construction work.Beyond supporting its businesses to expand internationally, China’s government will grow its soft-power initiatives in 2018, investing more in its Chinese culture centers at universities around the world, in its international media projection online and on traditional TV, and through its official overseas development-aid budget, the largest recipient of which in recent years has been Cuba.Domestic centralization and controlA strong, powerful leader with a team around him largely selected by the leader are common ingredients for more centralization for economic decision making and control. China is no exception. And economic success over the last five years, relative to the rest of the world, has created confidence that the government can micromanage at the sector level successfully. But there are additional reasons why China will be visibly more centrally controlled in 2018.In the financial sector in particular, regulators have moved beyond making examples of individuals whose actions they disapproved of, to a much clearer and complete set of regulations of what is permitted for wealth-management companies, insurers, and online financial-service providers, massively restricting opportunities for regulatory arbitrage. Areas of ambiguity that were large enough in the past, for example, allowed Internet players to become highly popular asset managers and key payments providers without a license. By 2019, it may be hard to even launch small incremental services without approval. Specifically in payments, all online payments will now have to pass through a central government-run clearing house, so that the government can now, should it choose, see who is passing money to whom. Clearer regulation is not a bad thing per se, many multinationals have complained for years that they could not invest with certainty due to ambiguity over regulation. We can hope that the data-protection and cybersecurity laws become similarly clearer in 2018.Credits:—What can we expect in China in 2018?",2,0.12783414502164495,0.40877976190476173,0.870003014695468

712,"Till now China has made no blunders respectively to it's economic policy. Since the formation of People's Republic of China in 1949. In the early or during the Mao's era China was developing but the pace was not too high. After Mao's demise , Deng Xiaoping became the paramount leader of China in 1978. He was the chairman of China & said to be the inceptioner of the booming economy. China is a communist nation & socialism is a part of communism but Deng Xiaoping gave a unique statement that “We will follow Socialism but with Chinese characteristics”. He opened the Chinese economy , made reforms which boosted the manufacturing sector , gave stimulus to the traders to invest & due to which the Chinese GDP grew more than 10% perpetually for two decades. After Xiaoping many leaders came & had done their respective work.In 2012 Chinese communist party was to choose it's new general secretary & the new President of People's Republic of China. On 15 November 2012 , Xi Jinping was elected as the new President of China & the general secretary of Communist Party of China. In 2013 when President Jinping was on his official tour of Kazakhstan in Almaty (capital of Kazakhstan) President Jinping officially spoke about his ambitious project named One Belt One Road. It was the first time he portrayed his vision regarding the project & described what will be it's implications on the rest of the world.One Belt One Road , is an ambitious project. It is all about rejuvenating the pristine Silk Route , which goes all the way from China to Europe passing through naturally rich Central Asia. Earlier Silk Route was limited to land transport as goods from China to Europe were transported through land. OBOR is not just limited to developing the land route but also the railways , waterways & air transport between China & Europe.But everything is not so optimistic as it seems. OBOR can become the biggest blunder of China. OBOR is like an open cheque book offer , China is giving massive loans to the nations to build their infrastructure. But investment under OBOR is quiet different from the regular one. When China invests in any country especially in the construction sector , all the work is done by the Chinese firms which means that the country in which investment is being done , it's companies will not take part in the construction process & also the major work force will be Chinese. Now why does China's foreign direct investment is different from others? This is because the infrastructure of China is all ready so developed that the construction companies of China have nothing much to do in their country. The Chinese cities are full of skyscrapers & over construction of tall buildings have converted many cities into ghost towns & also the labour force in China is no more the cheapest in the world so the Chinese companies invest especially in those countries whose infrastructure is extremely poor & where there is abundance of work.Pakistan , a bankrupt economy. An economy with extremely poor infrastructure & a massive population of (20–25) crore. A country which is generally not on the investment chart of foreign companies but this country has got a prime position for Chinese investment. China Pakistan Economic Corridor or CPEC is a whopping $46billion investment in Pakistan under OBOR. It is an economic corridor that that will be build by the Chinese construction firms & will be connecting Girgit , Baltistan in POK to Gwadar in Baluchistan. There will be a cluster of roads & highways going through whole of Pakistan , building new airports & most important rejuvenating the port of Gwadar. These investments will really boost the Pakistani economy but all of this will be done by China & funding will be in the form of loan & we all know pakistan will never be able to repay it's debts. All ready pakistani economy is not performing well because of severe political instability & lack of security due to terrorism & Pakistan has already taken massive loans from IMG & World Bank.This will result in increase in the Non Performing Assets for Chinese banks. CPEC will result in influx of cheap Chinese goods into the country & slowly it will destroy the domestic companies of Pakistan as they won't be able to compete with the cheap Chinese goods. Local industries will collapse & will shut their production which will increase the unemployment rate & onus on the economy.Sri Lanka is also in crisis. Being a member of OBOR initiative Chinese investors have also invested in Lanka. The port city of Hambantota is a such example. The port is developed by Chinese firms but the airport build in Hambantota is the biggest issue. If you google out ‘World's Emptiest Airport’ the result will be Hambantota airport. $600 million have been invested to build the airport. Hambantota , a city with low population & not a big tourism attraction is having an airport bigger than Colombo. The Rajpakshe government projected the investment as a significant one & said that it will make the economy robust but everything was said for political gains. In reality it is just a liability for the government & it's a useless property. The incumbent Sri Lankan finance ministry has itself castigated the investment & chances of repaying the debts are very bleak. This may further result into a NPA for Chinese banks.Greece , a country facing severe financial crisis is also looking towards China for a help. After hosting the Olympics 2004 in Athens , the Greek economy had declined year by year & in 2017 situation became so adverse that it was finally declared as a bankrupt economy. Being a member of European Union , bailouts were provided by Central European Bank & Germany but nothing hasn't much changed. Chinese firms eagerly waiting to invest in Greek properties & Greece is in dire foreign investment. Chinese firms have leased the largest port in Greece & granted various bailouts to the government to clear of its mounting debts but the future of Greece is still bleak. Unemployment is rising , tourism is low & the decisions taken by Alexis Tsipras government haven't been so fruitful. So in the long run we will see that whether the economy will rejuvenate or it wiil become even debt ladenSo everything about OBOR is not so optimistic as it is a unilateral path. It is all about exporting the cheap Chinese goods to the partner countries & nothing regarding import is talked about under OBOR. The massive influx & over dumping of cheap Chinese goods will definitely corrode the tiny economies & will jeopardise the domestic companies & the emerging start-ups.Thank You.",8,0.043044325239977435,0.36648538418103643,0.9789524166458321
713,"The biggest blunder of chinese economy in recent times it its debt problem. See thi figure:You can see its total debt has gone up from 150% to 250% of gdp in 2017. This clearly states that debt is growing much faster than the gdp.What happened in 2008 was that after the global financial crisis. China faced a slump in economic growth as demand from USA and europe slowed down. This lead to more than 4 million people being unemployed in china. This led the chinese government to change its economic mission, The government wanted china to move from a production economy to a consumption economy. At that time, consumer spending only contributed to around 30–35% of gdp which is low compared to 60–70% in the western countries. Government went on spending spree, it spent a lot on infrastructure including roads, high speed rail, airports and whole cities. The government encouraged loans so as to increase consumption but in china where the savings rate is more than 50% this was very difficult.This program unfortunately didn’t go well. Though China used more cement than the whole developed world combined, built more high speed rail than whole of europe and even built whole cities some even larger than manhattan it couldn’t accelerate gdp growth. China has complete newly built ghost cities that have top of the line infrastructure, some of these cities even resemble famous western cities but sadly no one lives there.All these spending spree lead to a whole load of bad loans and slowed down growth to 6.5% which in the previous decade was 9–10%.

715,"The US used to be very supportive to China’s economic development. It supported China’s gradual open up the market and agreed to allow certain trade barrier (tariff, market entrance restrictions etc) to exist with the general agreement these barriers would gradually reduce and eventually disappear. The gradual, controlled measurement is important because one of the most important lesson learned in China’s modern development is that sudden abrupt changes in policy can cause disaster that quickly spin out of control. China is doing its part (of gradually open up) if anyone read the statistics. What is in disagreement right now is how fast China should open up. The US think China lowers its barrier way too slow which put its own economy in jeopardy. This kind of disagreement can only be solved when both sides sit down, look at the statistics together and talk things through, rather than resort to threat and mounting on new barriers.Now back to the question: What would happen to the Chinese economy if the US suddenly does a 180 reversal on its policy and supports everything that China wants to do?Now forget about the poorly worded phrase “everything that China wants to do”, what would happen to the Chinese economy if the US supports China. It will be the same as we saw in early 2000. An economic boom in China market. A freer market economy. Loads of small entrepreneurial opportunity. Opportunities for ordinary Chinese who are willing to start their own business to make it. Rapid growth of local consumption level. And extremely pro-American public opinion. On the other hand, US companies can captured the local market consumption boom and make huge profit from it. People focused too much on a couple of foreign enterprises failed to thrive in China market, but look around, how about Unilever, how about McDonalds, how about McKinsey & Co, Accenture, Buick, VW, LVMH, Dolce&Gabbana, Coca-Cola, Estée Lauder, OTIS… The US companies can hire young talented Chinese people too. Foreign MNCs used to be the number 1 choice of employer for Chinese university graduates for decades, until well into 2010s when Chinese companies started to catch up in compensation and benefit. When Motorola was hiring in China, applicants lined up from upstairs to the street. They are not blue collar assembly workers, but university grads. The former early Motorola China employees, who are now mostly above 40 years old, are the core experience senior executives in many local and International companies in China.It does not mean US has to be submissive to whatever China wants to do, but just reverse to the earlier years being supportive and dialogue on the assumption that both side want to collaborate and make things work. I want also to point out that in the 1980s and early 2000, the collaboration of the two countries is not one-sided, that China setup barrier and US patiently waiting. China provided massive favorable terms to international companies in terms subsidy (yes, China provide subsidy to foreign companies to setup shop in China, like Intel), tax exempt for a number of years, followed by reduced tax, reduced property rental price etc. Intel benefits from the Chinese government subsidy and tax exemption. Its then CEO Otellini said Intel saves USD 1 billion from building manufacturing in China.

They would be convicted and reported to public.In the early years that Xi Jinping comes to power,he just began to declare to fight corruption seriously,then a lot of corrupt politicians were sentenced.Not surprisingly,China’s score and rank went down on TI’s list,because those surveyed had more exposure to this country’s corruption than before.Meanwhile,in the west,there is a thing called political donations.Cooperation can give money to politicians to support their campaign which would definitely recognised as corruption in China but totally legal in the West.Image how would the list be if that phenomenon were widely considered as corruption as well.How could we know that how actually corrupt a country is?See the efficiency of investment.How much per 1$ yields when it was invested in a place.",1,-0.02889822595704949,0.45060690943043885,0.9921189159255301

743,"I am far from having any expertise in technology, but since the question is asking about the “wider implications,” I might provide some of my thoughts on this issue here. I think we can look it from different levels and perspectives.For the Chinese government, this is an alarming call -- to wake up from all those self-boasting nonsense. China is still a long way to go to reach the so-called technological strong power status.Yes indeed, China has achieved numerous “breakthroughs” in sci-tech and also some other fields during the past several decades; China is dubbed as a bellwether of the “four new great innovations” -- namely, high-speed rail, e-commerce, mobile payment and shared bicycles......But has China obtained all the “core technologies” needed to support all those “breakthroughs?” Are the “four new great innovations” more of just a change of models, instead of real technological inventions or innovations (except the high-speed rail)?With this said, the first wider implication should be: YES, China has to and must be more self-reliant in the high-tech sector. And once the government really feels the pain, such as the pain brought by the US’ banning ZTE from buying American components, will it invest more budget and pool more talents into research the core parts and core technology of its own. And in China’s logic, once the government, especially the top-level leaders are determined to do so, then we can expect it happen, sooner or later, no matter how difficult it would be.The influence will definitely expand further, instead of just being limited in the chips, or semiconductors/electronics, etc., China has to and will dive into the deep sea of R&D (research and development) of various high tech core products of its own.And this leads to the second implication: China will definitely have its own chips one day, maybe within 7 years of the banning period, or maybe much longer. During the process, suffering losses, enduring some inconveniences brought by the lack of high-standard, high-quality components from the US, etc. are what we can expect. But China can get over it step by step. And till that day, the US will find it is facing a larger and stronger competitor, in more fields than today.For the enterprises level, what the Chinese enterprises, including the state-owned ones and the private ones, must learn from the ZTE lesson, is to follow the international rules and also observe, respect and follow the local laws, regulations and even the culture, while doing business with any other nations.As the Belt and Road Initiative (B&R) accepted by more nations, and catapulted by China’s “going out” strategy, more and more Chinese enterprises are investing abroad. Taking ZTE as an example, if it followed strictly all the rules and regulations, there would be no excuses for the US to impose a ban on it.(But of course, there is an old saying in China: If you are out to condemn somebody, you can always trump up a charge. No one is perfect, neither does any company.)I firmly believe that, there is no “real” winner in any wars of any forms, no matter hot war, or trade war, or technology war......So, it seems that the US has indeed dealt a deathly blow on ZTE, and hence a heavy blow on China, does this mean it won’t endure any losses by its side? Probably not. Qualcomm, the main supplier of components, especially the chips for ZTE mobile phones, lost one of its largest clients.Though currently, ZTE is, in a de facto paralysis, I guess, it has to turn to other suppliers sooner or later before China develops quality components of its own. And will nations who can provide alternatives, including Japan, South Korea, Germany, France, or Netherlands, etc. reject such a large client?Don’t forget, besides ZTE, there are several other large mobile phone manufacturers in China, for fear that they will one day be banned by the US, they might also turn to other alternatives.This means the US is losing its clients, forcing its clients to turn to its competitors of other nations for cooperation, and in the meantime, China will come back as a strong competitor against it one day.And also, since the US hurt China seriously in the tech war, I don’t think China will just swallow it and does nothing. Revenge might be on the way, but not necessarily from the tech side, since China is actually lagging far behind the US in this field.And also, from a third nation’s perspective, with the US targeting China, and also some other countries with bullets including military wars, punitive tariffs, trade wars, tech wars......Will it point its gun at my head one day? Is this US the same US who constructed the current world order and who has been a leader, guarder and defender of the world order? Can we trust it any more?

745,"The trust we Chinese had in free trade and the US had been shaken, badly.And yes China will work its ass off to become more self-reliant in ALL areas in the next few decades.We had a plan in place to develop our own semiconductor industry, but it was not in a hurry, and according to that plan we can take our time, because this is one of the goals that can not be achieved easily.We lived in a bubble, where free trade exists and it will not be easily affected by policy makers.And that bubble just bursts.Blow is a quote from the CEO of Huawei, and he said this back in 2012:我们现在做终端操作系统是出于战略的考虑，如果他们突然断了我们的粮食，Android 系统不给我用了，Windows Phone 8系统也不给我用了，我们是不是就傻了？同样的，我们在做高端芯片的时候，我并没有反对你们买美国的高端芯片。我认为你们要尽可能的用他们的高端芯片，好好的理解它。只有他们不卖给我们的时候，我们的东西稍微差一点，也要凑合能用上去。我们不能有狭隘的自豪感，这种自豪感会害死我们。……我们不要狭隘，我们做操作系统，和做高端芯片是一样的道理。主要是让别人允许我们用，而不是断了我们的粮食。断了我们粮食的时候，备份系统要能用得上。”It says—It is out of strategic concerns that we decided to develop our own device OS now. If they forbid us from using Android and Windows Phone 8 one day, will we be caught empty-handed and have nothing to do?For the same reason, when we develop high-end chips, I also not against you guys to buy high-end chips from the US. I think you should use their high-end chips as much as possible and gain a good understanding of them. When they refuse to sell things to us, our products can also be used as backups even though the quality is not as good as theirs. We cannot afford to embrace an unreasonable sense of pride, as it will kill us eventually. Our direct goal is to make money and take up Shangganling. If we cannot take up Shangganling, we should at least take up the Wall Street. We cannot be narrow-minded. The reason why we develop the OS is the same as that why we develop high-end chips. We wish others can allow us to use their products. However, if they forbid us from using their products, our backup systems must be used and play the same role.This is actually a common mentality when we are dealing with Anglo-Saxons.Still, no one believed it would happen in 2018 until it does.ZTE’s case helps to increases China’s dedication significantly.Now no one will jump out when the government decides to pour in billions of dollars into developing semiconductor industry which could lead to nowhere.

746,"“China becoming more self-reliant”That’s the wider implication from this ban. But it will takes time to be self sufficient in technology component. Maybe 5 to 6 years China probably need. The thing is producing the components is not a problem for china but producing the highest level components that works in a same performance as the in market components from Intel, Qualcomm, Texas Instruments and many other industry leaders that I will not named here. Pouring more money is not the absolute solution. Chinese companies also need technology. From more than 1000 Chinese semiconductor companies majority of them are small companies that surely not just small in funding but also lack in high technology know how. Of course ZTE can sources their components from this companies as an alternative but be ready for sub par product performances. Don't be too proud of China achievementsl in designing and developing its first Supercomputer CPU. ShenWei(SW26010) is not a perfect CPU. Of course it beats Intel Xeon in Speed-power to energy consumption ratio but in multitasking it's lacking confirmed by potential clients and researchers.Japan also can design and develop their own Supercomputer CPU (although the architecture is from ARM) and not reliant on Intel if they want. Plus ARM is now is owned by Softbank.Fujitsu picks 64-bit ARM for Japan's monster 1,000-PFLOPS superAlso K Supercomputer (Japan's second fastest Supercomputer) was using SPARC64 architecture.So it not just China’s only trend. But in executing task many agree that US and Japanese Supercomputer still better than Chinese Supercomputer. So here people will see China just wanting a bragging right by straight developing the most powerful supercomputer but neglecting the “real importance” of Supercomputer.So this can be apply to other attempts also from China. Right now China is fighting to lift the level of their Semiconductor industry. Starting from Memory. Chinese memory makers(Tsinghua and YMTC) still generation behind Top 3 (Samsung, SK Hynix and Micron) in technology. And it being told by experts if the Chinese companies trying to move up the ladder they are at risk of stepping on the big 3 intellectual properties(DDR3, DDR4 technology). Maybe they can “escape” the lawsuit in China's market but it would be a different story in international markets.And Tsinghua eyeing every opportunities to acquire many US or European component makers tell us that China is still lacking in consumer level technology know how. To develop the same level components it could take probably 6 years if not decade working from scratch. They also need to watch on possible lawsuit problem.So as a conclusion of course China can work themselves to be self sufficient in electronic Components but people here need to grounded theirself into reality. China is always see the need of creating “an alternative” in consumer technology, before sanction or after but the results were always not sufficient enough to compete with market leader. But they can always trying again and again and I will waiting for the result.",11,0.15065476190476187,0.4684093915343916,0.9659335278113976
747,"First I’d say no way that China keeps growing on itself. Think about what happened to S.U. And think about why China keeps growing so fast since 1980s. IT IS BECAUSE FOREIGN CAPITAL AND FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY. Without them, China definitely cannot keep growing, even will encounter big social problem, even civil war. Because made in China will die immediately and millions of people lose jobs. If you ever visited a China factory, you will find most key machines are made in USA, made in Gemerny and made in Japan. Without the foregn technology, don’t say cellphone, even to manufacture a radio is a problem.The crisis behind made in ChinaIn April, 2018, US govt announced that all US companies are banned to sell any hardware and software to a China tech company ZTE for 7 years. As a giant electronics company, ZTE is one of largest telecom station equipment suppliers all around the world and the fourth larggest smartphone sellers in US, the first three are Apple, Samsung and LG. In 2017, ZTE’s revenue is over 100 bn RMB (US $15 bn). This punishment is because that ZTE has lain to US govt. In 2017, ZTE paid US govt $8.92 as punishment for illegally exported goods to Iran. And ZTE agreed to punish 35 employees. But late US govt found that instead of punish the 35 employees, ZTE actually praised them.In China, the most famous and legendary company is Huawei. Years ago, ZTE was even better than Huawei. But finally Huawei became much more successful than ZTE, personally I think it is because ZTE is a state-run company, the management system is corrupted. Many former state-run employees say in state-run rompanies, relationship is much more important than personal quality. Most chief managers are families of Govt officers, and their salaries are extremely high (normally one year 1 Mn RMB – US $150k is only a starting salary ), even though generally rarely really contribute to company, but even trying to make state-own property to be their own. And actually the western world doesn’t recognize China economy as MARKET ECONOMY, even though China govt insists that it is. But the truth is that state-run most companies get orders with help of govt. For e.g. China govt doesn’t allow private companies to run business in oil, telecom operation, banking, transport, insurance and amny other major industries. While only a few state-run enterprises have been monopolizing those industries for decades. China has been investing a lot in infrastructure construction such as high speed trains. For those govt projects, state-run companies have much moe priorites than private companies. Even they can sell lower quality products at a higher price than private companies.Many state-run companies are under protection of govt. That’s why they make lots of money easily, but they are not efficient at all. This rude economy control results in great unfairness between state-run and non-state-run. Have a look at the China fortune 100, over 90% of them are state-run companies. What, you want to do telecom or oil or banking business? Govt won’t give you business license at all, if you do secretly you will be arrested.List of largest Chinese companies - WikipediaIt is like Jack is a mayor and there is a $10 Bn public metro project. And Jack’s son is CEO of a state-run or private company. Jack secrectly gives the order to his son, even though there is a so-called public fair bidding. In the govt, most officers get benefits from Jack and afraid of him. To the public, govt doesn’t release true infomation or even lie. State-sun companies have become privileged class’s tools to rob Chinese people, but nothing related to welfare of ordinary people.Personally I agree that China economy is not market economy. Many foreign companies complain it is too hard to do business in China, you need know Guanxi and how to steal business secret, majority doesn’t have patience to make a real good products, IP is not well protected and respected, etc. Actually not only hard for foreign companies, but also very hard for China private companies. I think what makes China business so hard and unfair is the corruption of govt. Think about it, if you are an owner of private company, work really hard for surviving. You and a state-run company both bid for a highway project. Your team has been working hard for months to come up with a good solution and good price. While the state-run company just easily won with a shabby solution but much higher price. Then can you still behave like nothing happened and continue working hard, can you still believe in that better quality and competitive price is the key of wining order? You probably understand that Guanxi (relationship) is much more important than product/service and price, and you probably start to learn take shotcut. Even though you don’t want to, you have to if want to survive.People may be astonished that ZTE really dared to sell to Iran and even praised the 35 employees (ecomomic criminals to US) after paid around $900 Mn forfeit. Why ZTE didn’t obey agreements with US govt and hasn’t punished those 35 employees? I think fisrt it is because the 35 employees must have Guanxi (relationship with chief govt officers). Second, because the state-run companies are too corrupted, cannot make a right decasion. They get used to taking shotcut and cheatting, there is no respect to laws and rules in their blood. Third, ZTE is a state-run company, they believe the powerful central govt is getting their back.This news has become headline of China domestic media. But what they are focusing on is that Trump is trying to start a trade war, punishment to ZTE is a kind of cold war like US against SU. I think it is meaningless and stupid, do they really think nationalism can save made in China, can improve China technology? Also main media say China need to develop IC technology, it is dangerous to rely on foreign IC companies. Once they don’t supply core IC hardware and software, made in China will die. Yes it is true. But what they don’t mention is that many Chinese companies like ZTE don’t obey rules & laws and compete illegally, invest more on Guanxi (relationship) than technology.What I believe is that China govt need to transfer from RULE, CONTROL, to SERVE. The privilege class shouldn’t be too greedy, should stop sucking blood of innocent people. Stop robbing people by unfair competition, by controling resource, even in the name of protecting people, in the name of law and fairness, don’t be too greedy. When govt becomes transparent, the world and Chinese people will feel safe. When China economy is a real market economy, people will truly benefit from growing of China.

751,"This recent trade war has been sparked for protecting the US economy from china exports. China exports subsidized steel and aluminium to US and other countries. China is the biggest steel producer in the world currently. It accounts for 42 percent of world steel production.[1]china hiked its tariffs on 106 imports from the US in response to a US tariff’s hike on Chinese imports. So between this gap, India can bolster the trade relationship with china. So the trade deficit can be reduced between both countries but not significantly.Positive impacts:60 percent soybean exports of US go to china. But china hiked tariff on soybean of US imports. China exports lot of agricultural products to India. But now India can pitch the soybean exports to china.[2]China raised tariff rate cotton to 25 percent to US imports. Last year, India exports almost 25 percent of the China’s cotton imports. So we can get a piece of pie from increasing our cotton exports to china.[3]China hiked tariffs on mostly food items of US imports. So exporting food items will bolster the bilateral trade. But It is not going to reduce much of our trade deficit.Negative impacts:The impacts of the trade war between US-China may not have any direct impacts in emerging economies. Because the target of US is China. But perhaps India will be a victim of this trade war. India accounts for only 2 percent of the US total import of the steel. China may dump their cheap aluminium to Indian markets and sweep jobs of this industries.

762,"What the main reasons for the China's successful transition from a planned economy towards a market economy, as opposed to the failure of Soviet Russia doing a similar transition?A lot of the answers here don’t seem to know what really happened. Basically, China conducted controlled experimentation, while Russia played Russian roulette.There were two key controlled experiments that China introduced in early 80’s. The first one is Dual-track system in 1981, which allowed State-Owned Enterprises to sell products above the planning quota freely in the market place, at whichever price. Now you have a market price, and you have market-driven innovation. All this, without the risk of the sudden shortage and/or unemployment. Dual-track Price System -- china.org.cnThe second controlled experiment is Special economic zones of China. Just 4 of them set up between 1980 - 1984. One of them is Shenzhen, which looked like this in 1980.It was selected because it was just a sleepy, small fishing village that if things don’t work out, you can afford the downside. Shenzhen has the key geographic advantage of being close to Hong Kong. Close enough to attract capital and investment from Hong Kong for manufacturing. Xi Jinping’s father, Xi Zhongxun, was tasked by Deng Xiaoping to set Shenzhen up. So Xi Senior went to Beijing to ask Deng, so, what do you want me to do with this special economic zone with no money? And Deng said, well we have no money, but we can give you some favorable policies. You just have to figure it out without any fund from the Central Government. 37 years later, Shenzhen looks like this, with a GDP at $338 billion in 2017, just surpassed Hong Kong.Shenzhen economic expansion dwarfs growth in Hong Kong and SingaporeChina itself is basically a giant portfolio of experiments. It’s actually more de-centralized than the US, where local officials are positively encouraged to experiment and share the learning with each other. These experiments are set up so that only those policies that deliver positive outcomes get adopted nationwide. So it’s a continuous improvement model. It’s not that the Chinese didn’t make any mistakes. They probably made vastly more mistakes than the Russians. But they are localized, “affordable mistakes”. As a result, they also learned tons more about how to make free market work for them as well.These features are detailed in the book Amazon.com: China's Great Economic Transformation (9780521712903): Loren Brandt, Thomas G. Rawski: Books, written by two econ professors. One from University of Toronto. The other from University of Pittsburgh.Fundamentally, the Chinese mind is wired differently than the Russians. One is apatheist. The other is theist. Throughout history, whenever the Chinese encountered something that they don’t know what to do with, they de-centralize power, get more people to experiment, and adopt the approach with the best outcome. The Russians are not like that. China is the only country where policy-making, law-making, institution-making, are all experiment-based. One must work with the Reality, not the Theory or Mythology, always. (i.e., For example, you don’t have congressmen debate and then vote to pass new laws in China. Instead, you try out the draft law in some small district, monitor the outcomes, analyze the result, revise it, then try it out again in larger cities. Repeat until you’ve got enough data to make it into a national law. No data, no law.)",456,0.15061622051417972,0.44040772153017044,0.962671182964183
763,"It's hard for me to move away from my own biases shaped by my background but trying my best to earn a cursory understanding of China has led me to this: It's not a free market.I think that a lot of people want to buy into the concept that western democracy is the “end of history” or that it's the only system capable of bringing happiness and prosperity. It doesn't matter how many times that fails across the world because every westerner grew up in a successful system that we all grouped together as “Western democracies”.China was very successful under communism. It went from mass exodus emigration from the Qing dynasty days, the utter failure of the transition into a republic, the yearly famines, foreign invasion and unequal treaties back to where China normally is; one of the most powerful countries in the world. It's not even close to its full power yet. Then under Deng Xiaoping it under went a transformation to what he called market socialism.But, the key point is that the state government chose to make this deliberate transition. In Russia, who chose it? The USSR dissolved against the wishes of many and a collapse followed. So, first, it was a planned transition not a disorderly collapse into a government void.Second, China didn't simply let go of the market. For me, I've seen crown corporations, my country's history (Canada) includes a mega corporation under a crown charter colonizing a significant swath for the fur trade. My perspective is coloured by the fact that I know a “private” corporation can have an exceptionally visible government hand meddling in its affairs and directing its efforts for the “greater good”. China is similar. I am most familiar with tech, and what do I see?Case study: Digital CashChina began to partially privatize some banks decades ago and with this came a slow liberalization of business models. Stock trading became popular. During this came two tech giants of tencent and Alibaba. The Chinese government itself was convinced that a cash based economy was a thing of the past and wanted to move ahead. The plan? Social credit!What a dismal failure! Social credit was not adopted by the Chinese companies because it was bad. The main problem? It locked out people from the economy. These tech companies wanted to include people, no matter how poor, into their business models.Government reassessed, gave up on the social credit model. From the market economy came an accidental success; people used a leaked feature on WeChat to move money for red envelopes (a tradition during new years). This grew into a digital way of moving cash over debit rails.Seeing this success, the Chinese government let it run wild for about five years. Many new technologies were developed by the market. Digital cash bloomed. Then they rolled out regulations. What were they? Government is now backing the market with banking regulations to allow the same digital cash to access investment funds and other financial vehicles to allow even the poorest Chinese resident the same interest growth opportunities as bankers in Shanghai.China uses a mixture of “market periods” as a sort of crowd sourcing of ideas, development, and then the heavy hand of government to direct corporate direction and spread the wealth.When you look at spending, China favours significant wealth transfer, domestic development and building up areas.Case study: TibetI come from Canada. My country has these things called “native reserves”. You might as well be in a shithole in a war zone, and that's on purpose, we built these horrible areas to make indigenous people suffer and want them to give up their heritage and become like non indigenous Canadians. Some of my compatriots will disagree but that's what it is.It's Canada and 70% don't have clean drinking water. They suffer cholera and TB in the 21st century.Then I hear about “free Tibet”. I see high speed rails that Canada as a whole can't even build (though the irony is that a Canadian company built it in China). I see brand new universities. I see massive housing efforts providing for the people. Top notch schools. Roads. Hospitals. Free Tibet? Indigenous people in Canada would want to join China if they could.This success has nothing to do with the market. China and its government chooses to consistently use its wealth to improve the welfare of its people. This is a government actively afraid of people's lives not improving. I wish the Canadian government gave half a shit about me instead of just bankers. My vote means almost nothing.I'll end off my analysis by saying that China is not an example of a successful model to copy. They're like an updated Qing dynasty. An emperor running a massive country with 21st century technology to figure out problems.Instead, China is an example of putting in competent people and then getting competent results. They are an example of a system to consistently produce competent replacements.That's how I view their success and admire it even if it can't be copied into Canada.",40,0.13530714756258236,0.425298324863542,0.9980157231465976
764,"One crucial difference—Russia transitioned to capitalism way, way, way too fast.Russia went through that transition in roughly 3 years, from the 1990 to 1993. The Soviet Union privatized and sold off all, and I mean ALL, of its assets to corrupt insiders in the Communist Party for cents on the dollar, which then led to a pillaging of state resources and the enrichment of a very few insiders and the impoverishment of all other Russians. These are the infamous mafia billionaires of Russia who now support Putin. There was also no experimentation—all of Russia was, all at once, made capitalist and privatized overnight. This sent shock-waves through the Russian economic system that totally destabilized it, which led to an economic contraction (and pain) deeper and greater than what the U.S. suffered during the Great Depression. This Russian economic depression lasted from roughly 1991 to around 2002 or so, obliterating the wealth and hopes of a whole generation of young Russians and leading to an immense increase in criminality and social breakdown. This also resulted in the vast majority of Russians sinking into poverty.China, on the other hand, went very slowly in its transition from a centrally-planned communist economy to capitalism. Its transition occurred from 1981 to around 2010 or so (and some experts say that China is still going through that transition). It also experimented with introduction of capitalism—only a few select parts of China were made capitalistic “special economic zones” at the beginning of free-market reforms in the early 1980s, and as those areas became successful, the nation’s leaders carefully liberalized more and more of China. This process happened in around 25 years or so. There was also no privatization and sell-off of assets in China—the government retained those assets for itself. What the Chinese government did do was to encourage heavy foreign investment, technology transfers with foreign firms, and entrepreneurs to establish their own profit-making enterprises in these special economic zones. As a result most billionaires in China are self-made men who built up their own businesses instead of stealing massive assets from the state. That makes these men less criminally-inclined and more innovative with their businesses and money.The result of this slow approach—China has had the fastest growing economy in the world for the past 30 years, lifting up roughly 900 million people out of absolute poverty. The Russian transition was different, it sent 100 million people into a worse poverty than what they suffered during Soviet times.So, the sequence and the speed of capitalistic transition matters A LOT.Russia (and the other former Soviet republics) would’ve benefited tremendously if they had gone through the Chinese “slowly but surely” route in their transformation from centrally-planned economies to the free markets. Certainly Russia and those other nations would’ve had more stable and robust economies, and richer citizens overall, which would’ve meant stronger democratic norms and fewer dictatorships. A slow economic evolution could’ve even prevented a corrupt strongman like Putin from seizing power in Russia.",75,0.069478021978022,0.48806166056166056,0.9967719546164446
765,"Many years ago I’ve read a very insightful article on the subject, and I’ve miraculously been able to recover it: How China Won and Russia LostI strongly suggest you read it but, to sum up: dekulakization in the USSR was complete, both in terms of means (the best part of the 20s as well as the early 30s were spent violently persecuting them, with rabid mobs, military-style actions, deportation to the GULag, mass executions, artificial famines) and in terms of sheer chronological distance: in the 1980s there simply was nobody left alive to remember functionally how entrepreneurship and demand/supply work.In the USSR, the “Old Man” and his knowledge of how “capitalism” (ie. free trade) works were eradicated, and the path to Communism was taken at full speed.Keep in mind that “kulaks”, despite being painted as rich, greedy exploiters, where in fact simple peasants, with very slightly above-average wealth: some could afford to hire a hand for the reaping season, some had one more cow than their neighbors, or two pigs — maybe they were filthy rich and owned a horse. Most were simply poor but enterprising peasants and in many villages, all it took to be branded a kulak was an envious neighbor calling you that.Thus were all traces of rural entrepreneurship wiped out, that had emerged after the emancipation of serfs in 1861. Quoting from the linked study:By Gorbachev’s time, the farm population had shrunk to a quarter of its former size; only older workers remained, working perfunctorily on state land or tending their private plots. They had long been converted into wage workers and received pensions and socialized medical care, albeit of a low quality. In China, rural dwellers accounted for 80 percent of the population; compared to Russian farmers they were young and vibrant. They lived without the social guarantees of Russian farmers. In China, only the young had not experienced private agriculture. Small private plots had existed in China for 2,000 years. An elderly farmer in Jingshan village succinctly captured this historical memory: “Family farming is as natural as human desire to eat, to have sex, and to love grandchildren. We loved family farming because it gave us some freedom. The leaders thought they knew better how to live our lives. But it is our lives, isn’t it?”In Russia, few farm dwellers could even remember the last experiment with private agriculture in the 1920s.In the wake of this Randian eradication of entrepreneurship, only Dirigist pseudo-economics were left. Fast forward half a century and this is, in the immortal prose of P.J. O’Rourke, people’s economic reasoning in the Gorbachov era:They were fabulous markets. They’d do any nation proud. Except for one little problem — no customers. Some people were wandering around but it was the kind of wandering that Americans do in Porsche showrooms. Prices in the private markets were high. Meat was selling for 25 rubles a kilo. That’s 38c a pound, but the average Ukrainian makes 250 rubles a month. So 38c a pound is like going to the Safeway and getting 16 ounces of London broil for a hundred bucks. But it wasn’t poverty alone that made the private markets such dysfunctional and unbustling places. Prices weren’t just high, they were bizarre. For one thing, they were all the same. Each babushkaed grandmother selling lentils was selling lentils for the same price as every other grandmother — no premium for quality, no discount for quality and no haggling.I asked Marina about the beef. I said, “Isn’t the beef cheaper this time of the year? I mean, if you don’t slaughter cattle in the fall, then you have to feed them in the barn all winter, and, especially in a country with a grain shortage, I’d expect lots of people would be bringing cattle to market right now, increasing supply and driving down prices.”“No,” said Marina.“Now, pigs, on the other hand,” I said, “are raised on slops, and people are going to be tossing out food scraps year ‘round, so the price of pork would tend to remain constant.”“Meat,” said Marina, “sells for twenty-five rubles a kilo.”“Beef and pork, they both sell for the same price?”“Meat,” said Marina, “sells for twenty-five rubles a kilo.”“Fresh spring lamb?”“Twenty-five rubles a kilo.”“Stringy old mutton?”“Twenty-five rubles a kilo. Meat,” said Marina, “sells for twenty-five rubles a kilo.”There was another way to buy food in Kiev, at the state food stores with their long, scuffling lines at the head of which was nothing, just about nothing at all. There was bread, sometimes, that you could use as a medicine ball or a boat anchor. There were ten or a dozen five-gallon jars full of murky liquid with a few unidentifiable pickled things resting in the bottoms and other jars of the same kind which contained plain water. The sausages, when there were any to see, were a shock and a horror, looking like nothing but discarded sex toys. The produce was appalling. The potatoes resembled gray prunes and no other vegetable was distinguishable from compost.But the prices were right. The state store’s carrots — which could have passed as criminal evidence, wizened remains of a kidnap victim’s severed fingers maybe — cost 50 kopecks. And a kopeck is three-thousandths of a penny. The carrots in the private markets cost six times as much. Thus the Soviet economy is undermined by a kind of reverse black market from an anti-matter universe, a black market where it is legal to buy things you don’t want too cheaply.Every aspect of material life in the Soviet Union works this way. If you stand in line long enough the state provides goods and services. The services are out of service and the goods are no good, but food, clothing, shelter and medical care are — just barely — available. And they are hilariously inexpensive. The babushkas in the private markets don’t really have to sell you anything. They’re there to make money, not a living. If you don’t buy the food, well, then… fist/fist, forearm/forearm… they’ll take it home and eat it themselves, and you can stand in line for mummified carrots.“Return of the Death of Communism, part III — the saga continues”, from Give war a chance.The Soviets were left with no other policy than throwing money (subsidies) at a problem that wouldn’t seem to sort itself out — the only reaction a command economy knows, when the people lose their capacity to independently better their own condition.Whereas in China, the generational transmission of expertise had not been broken (1949–1978), the population were capable and actually willing to work in a free economy, and all that the Central Committee had to do was stop forbidding them from doing it. To quote from the linked paper:Deng Xiaoping’s famous description of Chinese reform as “fording the river by feeling for the stones” is not incorrect, but it was the Chinese people who placed the stones under his feet.Mikhail Gorbachev became general secretary of his party in March of 1985. By that time, he knew that the Chinese reforms were successful. His reforms, contrary to the popular narrative, closely mimicked China’s. He proposed to lease land to peasants, establish free trade zones, promote small cooperative businesses, and set up joint ventures. The difference was that Gorbachev imposed these changes from above, on an urban economy in which virtually all citizens worked for the state. Gorbachev’s reforms either were ignored or they were enacted with perverse consequences. Bottom-up reforms worked in China; top-down reforms failed in Russia.[…]Real reforms, whether dictated from the top or bubbling up from below, require a reform constituency. In the Chinese case, a large percentage of the population was recovering from the catastrophes of the Mao years. Rural dwellers, in particular, had witnessed the chaos of the Great Leap and had seen their parents and children die from starvation during the 1958–61 famine. They learned they had to take care of themselves. The urban elite had been ripped from the cities to a life of work and reeducation in the countryside during the Cultural Revolution, and a whole generation had been deprived of schooling. In the Russian case, the last famine lay three decades in the past. After the war, few people were executed for political crimes (political dissent became instead a mental disorder); the Gulag had been gradually dismantled after Nikita Khrushchev’s secret speech of 1956. All lived under the motto, “We pretend to work and you pretend to pay.”Surveys show that Russians were basically content with the system, comfortable in the bosom of their state enterprise or state farm.China had a reform constituency; Russia did not.Sometimes, it only takes for the grandson not to know grandpa’s life experience and, when the center no longer holds, all things fall apart.",78,0.07864481944099777,0.416843847942574,0.998512894835619

769,"The main reasons for China's successful transition from a planned economy towards a market economy, as opposed to the failure of Soviet Russia’s are twofold:China has a 2,000-year tradition of competent governance and Russia has none.China is ethnically and culturally homogeneous and Russia is heterogeneous.Russia’s Communist Party was pretty awful–rigid, grossly inefficient and often brutal. Yet, for all its faults, it was the best government the country had ever had. China, by contrast, had always had the best government on earth, just as it does today. It was always meritocratic, based upon the Confucian value of compassion, highly sophisticated and greatly admired by its people as this advice, from the Huainanzi in 221 BC illustrates:In a well-governed country, those who discuss policy must be in accordance with the law; those who carry out official matters must be regulated. Superiors evaluate actual performance; officials carry out their work efficiently. Words are not permitted to exceed reality. Actions are not permitted to overstep the law.In a disordered country, those who are praised by the multitudes are richly rewarded though devoid of accomplishments. Those who stick to their duties are punished, though free of guilt. The ruler is in the dark and does not understand. Worthies do not offer proposals. Officials form factions; persuasive talkers roam about; people embellish their actions. Those who are taken to be wise devote themselves to artifice and deceit; high officials usurp authority.

770,"Interesting question. A big book can be written about it. Here is what I think is relevant for for the understanding of this phenomenon.Chinese spent less time trying to implement communism. Russians have experienced multi-generational change. Russians (or rather all post Soviets) had their mentality broken, they did not want communism anymore (or didn’t care) but at the same time they forgot what market relationships and entrepreneurship really are. Respectively “lets make a quick buck” mentality prevailed in Russia.Soviet Union was economically more developed than China. Even today Russia on per capita basis is more developed than China. China started really low and it is understandable that they showed higher growth rate. When China catches up with Russia on GDP per capita their rate of growth might also slow down.Demographics. Huge Chinese population allowed enormous economies of scale. That was big enticing factor for Western investments. From Western point of view China had something that Russia didn't: unlimited supply of workers willing to do any job for minuscule pay.Internal politics. China was mono-state. It's territorial integrity was never threatened by market reforms. Soviet Union was Empire comprised of various national/ethnic entities. The Empire was long overdue for breakup. The disintegration of Russian Empire had actually started 70 years earlier and that was only temporarily delayed by flirtation with communism and arguably by WW2. When Market reforms started in USSR there was no way to confine them to economic matters only. The Empire failed apart and aftershocks of that event are still being felt today further retarding prospects of massive Western investments.",10,0.08153153153153155,0.40112612612612614,0.866301779017052

785,"A large hardworking labor forceEconomics prosperity depends on the size of labor force and productivity. China has a huge labor force. I mean ridiculously huge. If you exclude dependents, sick, out of world rural population, disabled, etc., China’s work force is 2–3 times US total population. All of them want a better life and they work extremely hard for it without complaining. My father loves to tell me the story about when he kid in 1970s, the only day our family can eat meat is Chinese New Years. It’s not steak, not sea food, it’s ground pork in dumplings. Put anyone in that environment, he/she will work hard.Unique governing systemChinese governing system, critiqued harshly by western media, is actually fantastic in terms of economic development. The system is a mixture of Meritocracy, Technocracy, Authoritarian, Socialism, and Communism. The country is governed by centralized decision makers who consult with an army of academia, business experts, and technical know-hows. This system cap down innovation and freedom, but it gets shit done. When there is a problem, governors sit down with experts to determine a opitimal solution. When facing trade offs, government can freely focus on long term benefit without worrying about public opinion. It strives to implement plans made by those who knows instead of pleasing those who don’t. This is how China is able to build a large infrastructure that most poor countries can’t.Willingness to changeUnlike other countries, China is willing to reform, and they do it consistently. China had a disastrous economic history from 1949 to 1978 under Communism/Socialism system. After visiting several developed nations, Deng Xiaoping determined that it is not possible to build wealth without a drastic change, hence ordering a market economy reform in 1978. This reform resulted a burst in productivity, which times the huge labor force, created an extrordinary output. It seems an easy thing to do in hindsight, but it’s not.Capitalism 2.0Chinese market has two part: one controlled part has SOEs for macro economics policy implementation and a free capitalism market. Its capitalism market is very different than other developed nations. Businesses in this market are subject to more pressure from governing authorities and less pressure from investors and analysts. In traditional capitalism, investors pressure business to grow and to beat earnings. Managements who focus on such metrics will tap unsustainable measures to expand their businesses. When they make mistakes, government borrow money to bail them out. Then they do the exact same thing expecting to be bailed out in the future. Chinese capitalism is different, governing authority has power over capitalists. When greedy capitalists do shady stuff that can undermine the economy, you don’t get bailout, you get a ticket to jail.Being poor is goodWhen a country is not developed, it has only one job to do - developing the economy. In a more advanced society, you have to worry about healthcare, international reputation, geopolitical threats, equality, etc. You have to worry about external stuff like allies and regional wars. Then you run into a developed bottleneck and cannot move forward until the next technology revolution. China is emerging, but still have a ton of potential. They will keep working on internal development until they are either developed or stopped. By the way, wars and corporate bailouts are the biggest reasons why America is in so much debt.Temperament of leadershipI was genuinely surprised when Xi Jinping start addressing and taking forceful actions on potential risks, such as private debt, outbounding acquisition. I thought the China would enter complacent period and start mounting foreign debt. On the contrary, it seems the leaders have a good humble temperament in making rational decisions.Also worth mentioningGeographic location: China is in a great place to trade with other nations.Large consumption demand from developed economies.Technological advancement such as the Internet and logistics.",21,0.0658380970880971,0.4574458411958413,0.9973674634715396

787,"Disclaimer : I’m not an economist. Nor am I educated in economics. You can say that my answer is entirely emotional and uneducated so choose to ignore if you find my observations irrelavant.I read some of the answers, and I felt that those who talks about slave labor, cheap labor, currency manipulation etc, have no idea about modern chinese background. After first coming to China 10 years ago and staying here for the past 8 years, I see a lot of changes happening in China, from a labor intensive low cost manufacturing economy to now a mid-high tech product powerhouse, one thing did not change. That is the chinese’s sheer willingness to work hard. The experts can make up a thousand reasons for their growth but all those reasons would be external, their success comes from within and nothing can help them if they are not willing to help themselves.I heard a lot of foreigners saying that chinese students studying in their country are boring. All studying and no play, makes a dull Jack. But essentially, what they believe in is grasping every opportunity they can and to work hard now so that they can play in style later. Such beliefs are ingrind in their soul. The same can be said for the workforce and business owners. For those who calls that slavery, it ain’t slavery if they are paid and willing. They genuinely happily earn good money for their work. Look who are the biggest spenders in tourism? They can’t be slaves if they have money to buy those stuff in your country. It’s slavery to you because you are not willing to work that hard.Of course, I’m not saying that all Chinese are rich. But what I can see in China is that for those actively seeking out opportunity and is willing to work hard, they get rewarded for it. And there are a lot of such people.Let me share the story of some of these people whom I got to know in the past 10 years.Li - Li is from Hebei province. She and her husband came to Guangzhou in 2001. They were not very educated and rather poor. They went to Guangzhou in hope of a better life as their farmland at home is not earning enough to feed their whole family of 3 siblings, 4 parents and 2 grandparents. Being the oldest amongst the youngest, they are the first to step out in the family in hope of improving everyone’s life. They managed to find work as security officers at the Guangzhou cosmetic expo.Li did not complete her high school education while her husband only finished primary school. While working as a security guard, she studies in her free time as she heard that those who graduated from high school can get better jobs. Her husband is rather more entreprenic in nature and socialise with the business owners in the expo alot. By the time Li graduates from high school through self study after 2 years, her husband has already laid out the ground work needed to understand how the cosmetics industry works.Li quit her job as a security guard and went on to join a cosmetic company in the expo as a export sales rep. Her husband also resigns and join a cosmetic factory as a worker to learn the trade better. For the next 3 years, they moved from their rental room to the company dorms to save money, staying apart. Li learns the trade very fast and picked up english as an additional skill, she also works extra hours to close more sales. Meanwhile, her husband gets promoted to be the supervisor of the production team.In 2007, Li and her husband decided to start out on their own with their savings of about RMB20,000. They rented a small counter at the cosmetics expo and brokered sales acting as the middle man. I got to know them in 2008 at their small counter at the cosmetic expo. The deals they managed to get are in turn given to Li’s former company for production, while her husband understanding how the production process is like, checks on the quality of the produce. They work long hours daily, unwilling to hire staff as they have little capital.In 2011, Li and her husband earns enough to start their own factory in Guangzhou Baiyun by renting a factory floor space of 500sqm. They finally starts hiring their own staff and buys their own equipment. By 2016, they bought their own 4 storey factory building. They now also owns several properties around China. Currently, I estimate their net worth to be RMB80million.Updated photo of Li’s Factory building in Guangzhou with the name blured out. (Don’t want to be accused of advertising.)Hu - Hu is from Heilongjiang. He graduated from Heilongjiang with a law diploma in 2005. He got a job as a legal assistant in Dalian shortly after he graduated. After working for a few months as a legal assistant, he felt that legal work is not his true calling.In a twist of fate, he found another job as a purchasing assistant for a fruit distribution company in Jinzhou Dalian. Being inexperience, he is offered little pay of about RMB400 a month. One of his OJT training requires him to go to the orchards to observe the harvesting of fruits. The work is hard and tedious as many of these orchards are located quite remotely, and he can only afford to ride a bicycle.Despite these, as a purchasing assistant, he learns that the profit margin is actually very high for fruits sold to the consumers directly from the orchards. Over time, he learn that there will be some fruits that his company is not willing to take in if the harvest is too much.With the little salary that he has, he roped in a couple of friends from his former school to pool their money together and buy the excess fruits from some of these orchards. They then split the fruits amongst themselves and peddle them on the streets or resell directly to some of the fruits stalls if the volume is too big.Over a period of 4 years their pool of money grew quickly. During this period, nobody took a single cent out of the pool and just let the money grow, profits are all returned to the pool to finance bigger volume of fruit. Hu’s salary during these 4 years, grew from RMB400 to RMB 1000. By 2010, their pool of money has grown to about RMB150,000. I got to know Hu through a mutual friend in 2011. My impression of Hu is that he has strong business acumen and is also an ambitious man.In 2010, under the leadership of Hu, they decided to rent an orchard space of 3000sqms in the rural area to start their own orchard growing cherries. Hu choose cheeries as he understands the business well through his job, he also knows that it is one of the most profitable fruits if sold during the correct season. They have not look back since.Now they OWN about 18000 sqm of orchard land and is involved heavily in the fruit industry of Dalian. They work together with the city government to provide low interest microloans between RMB 10,000–500,000 to farmers, they also setup a distribution portal online to allow farmers in rural areas to connect directly with fruit sellers in the city. The goverment sponsors their workshops to educate the farmers on how to modernise the argriculture industry through the use of modern machinery and the internet for sales. They are responsible for a logistic network that moves about 30 tons of fruits around the country daily to retailers. I estimate Hu’s personal net worth is to be around RMB 70million. And he is still working very jard daily.Photo of Hu at a presentation for farmers interested in loans and sponsorship by his company.These are just 2 person I know personally.

789,"China’s GDP in 2017 was about $12 trillion, or about 60% of the US’s $20 trillion. This made China the 2nd biggest economy in the world, with Japan a distant 3rd with around $5 trillion. It is not surprising many people are wondering how China went from a known poor third world country in the 1970s and early 1980s to become the world’s #2. Here are the reasons.Chinese are smart and they work hard. No explanation needed.China’s potentials were greatly suffocated by the planned socialist economic model imposed on China by the CCP under Chairman Mao Zedong, because he believed that socialism (state ownership, planned production, etc.) was superior to free -market capitalism. So China’s economy during the 1950–1980 period seriously under performed by all accounts. This came to an end in 1976 when Mao died and Deng Xiaoping started the free-market reforms in the late 1970s/early 1980s.The reforms liberated the minds and hands of the hard-working and intelligent Chinese population. For the next 30 some years, China’s economy grew at around 10% annually non-stop!With a population of 1.4 billion (4 times that of the US), any aggregate number will be dazzling. So with the 2nd largest economy, China is still by far a poorer country on a per capita base: its per capital GDP is only $8600 while the US is around 60,000.China achieved its economic growth at heavy costs: it has to give up environment, endure a phenomenal system-wide corruption, and allow wide income inequality between the poor and the rich. All these mismanagement and mistakes are biting back at China and costing its continued growth.So while China made huge progress in producing goods and services, it is still relatively poor and it needs to pay back for the mistakes it made along the way.",8,0.06953781512605041,0.4912114845938375,0.6752029522899418
790,"Interesting question!Suppose we compare China vs India, and S Korea vs Philippines. What lessons might we learn from the different historical growth? Two possible lessons come to mind:(i) universal education and public health provide the foundations for high growth;(ii) a government that is focused on development for everyone (“broad based growth”) delivers higher growth than a government that is (in practice) concerned only about a narrow part of society - e.g., the elites (“narrow based growth”).Just speculating! Many people who are smarter than me have tried to work out a “formula for growth”, but no one really knows.The great thing about investing in universal education and public health is that they both make a real difference to peoples’ lives, even if there is little economic growth. After all, economic growth isn’t the only thing that matters to people.That said, I feel sure that universal education and public health will eventually deliver long-term growth. It may be quicker for some countries (that have “good government”) and slower for other countries (with “less good” government).What makes a “good government”? Democracies are preferable, but weak democracies that are effectively controlled by an elite (e.g., capitalists) may perform worse than authoritarian governments that focus on delivering broad-based growth for everyone.A truly democratic government is a government that is focussed on growth for everyone, not just growth for the few^.^ Speculative comment: Growth among developed economies (US, Europe, Japan) have slowed considerably. Might it be because their respective governments have each failed to promote broad-based growth? Democratic governments are supposed to deliver growth for everyone, but in practice, wealth in the US and Europe (not sure about Japan) have become concentrated in the “top 1%”, with income stagnation for the rest.China should watch out that it doesn’t fall into that trap!(Just speculating!)",13,0.11108333333333331,0.4224236111111111,0.7568596045833289
791,"China 50 years ago was third world. So how did they become the second largest economy with more rapid GDP growth than the US? First of all China is a country with 4 times the population of the US. With so many people living under essentially a political dictatorship, people have very few rights and work for very little compared with other industrialized nations. As such and because they have very little in the way of regulations, china attracted a lot of industry because of an overabundance of cheap labor. However there has been a catch. In order to produce products in china companies have to hand over the technology. That has happened so many times by so many countries wanting to take advantage of cheap labor, China has become a money sponge. In addition they have used protectionist tactics to support their industries and kill their competition. For decades this was allowed to go on because people in our country and others were making a fortune off of it…but it was systematically destroying our manufacturing sectors.China has so much money now they are buying our businesses and inheriting pur intellectual property. What they can’t buy they steal through hacking. China has been very effective at waging war against our industries and unlike them…we see competition as healthy. They see it as war…a war they are winning!But all of this started with Nixon back in the 70’s that thawed relations with China by visiting the country. Interestingly enough, the Chinese leader at that time was the greatest mass murderer of all time.

For example, Egypt now is the largest population country in Middle East,what about his economy?

China has the largest market on the earth, every country was interested to do business with China. The world become more and more opening from 1970s last century, and China has caught up with the chance.Second, the leadership of Chinese communist party. I don't have good or bad view about the CCP.

793,"Planning, population and politics.Planning : Because China is a semi communist state the leaders and administrators are there for the long haul as well as having practically zero 'opposition'. This means that they are able to set out clear goals and have multi-year plans that everyone can follow. Because the leader must go through far fewer challenges to their authority than purely democratic leaders, the leader of China can have the forethought to do what needs to be done to advance the nation of China. The unhindered planning process means that there are also far fewer barriers to carrying out those said plans. However when speaking of leaders of absolute authority we could of course mention Russia but the difference is that instead of a few choice voices to comment China has many people sitting on committees so I think the interests of the people are better looked after as a whole than the Russian state.Population : There are lots of them. So when said plans are put in place many are following them and the resultant force or result is obviously very strong.Politics (or lack thereof) : China seems to try it's best to not get involved in foreign wars.

795,"Based on what I have seen so far in other countries and what I have seen in China itself, China' impact on world businesses has yet to be seen in its real might. My impression is that we will start to see it after about five to ten years.This does not mean there has not been any impact (there has, which I will describe shortly), but rather this impact will pale in comparison to the real impact that we will see.During the past thirty years (1990-now), China's impact was mostly based on the fact that it manufactured cheap products for foreign companies, to be sold worldwide, thus impacting the local industries which could not compete with the cheaper prices.In turn, from 1995-2010, most of the better quality products worldwide continued to be made by foreign brands, but in factories in China (Mobile phones like Apple, machinery, computers, etc.).Since 2010, there has been a further development - now it is Chinese brands that are competing worldwide - this started with Huawei - a small manufacturer of printed circuit boards in Guangzhou which got contracts to make telephone switching systems, thence rose up one level at a time, till they made cell phone and modem parts for various foreign companies.This is a trend that is followed across China, openly, by most Chinese companies. They make products for foreign brands (which approach them due to the cheaper labour costs for the same quality). They learn how to make these products and once they have mastered it, they venture out to make and market it in their name. It works sometimes (like in the case of Xiaomi, Huawei, Lenovo).Today, China itself has such a huge market that other brands that have done the same do not need to market themselves outside China. They are all well aware that their image is not necessarily that of a high quality company outside China even if their products are excellent. Thus mammoth companies like BYD and KingLong that could be considered as large as Ford and GM have not had much impact outside China - yet. The reason is simple, their efforts have a far better utility for the same marketing done in China, where their orders have simply multiplied over the years.My impression is that we will start to see their impact after about a decade, when these companies feel it worth their while to market themselves outside China.My impression is also that the west will realise this AFTER these companies take up a large slice of emerging markets like 40+ countries in Africa which the west has generally ignored as non existent. Unlike Japan and Korea, which were nurtured by the US and hence never did anything by surprise, China is different. The west has generally been ignorant of mainstream daily truths of China.(For example - even Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger were unaware of Petro China and BYD till they saw their annual reports two years back. And most common folk in China were well aware of the constructions in south China sea islands five years back while the west ""discovered"" this only when a write up appeared in 2015 in the Times!)having said that, some of these effects are already noticeable. Xiaomi and Huawei are already the largest selling phones in India. Walmart would not have achieved its popularity if not for China.",11,0.1010139225181598,0.37591404358353514,0.984358476417402

799,"I think what you are referring to is the devaluation of the RMB. By printing lots of currency you can devalue your currency against the other global currencies; however, China devalues their currency through deliberate adjustments of the actual exchange rate of their currency.This can lead to economic growth for when a country devalues their currency their exports become cheaper relative to that of the United States becuase now a US Dollar is stronger and can buy a greater quantity of products with the same amount of money. For a country that relies heavily on the growth of their manufacturing sector this can be a boon to the economic growth of the country.Nevertheless, there are disadvantages to doing this. Increased price of imports, inflation, and now that the government is stepping in to protect manufacturers they may grow complacent and less efficient due to the lack of true competition.TL;DR: Currency devaluation can spark growth, but has lots of consequences that the central bank issuing the devaluation must be aware of.",4,0.0630952380952381,0.2565476190476191,0.9427509479912901

But I think the really interesting point is whether you can actually increase GDP by printing and lending more money. Your intuition (or question) is not entirely off the mark because in an economy where there is massive under employment and low productivity the scope to increase productivity through capital investment is huge - a-la-Keynes. In the western and north western regions of China this is the case. If a farmer replaces a bullock with a Yanmar tractor and harvester he can produce a lot more rice for himself and his neighbours. There are a million opportunities when capital and new techniques are applied, but this can only happen if someone is willing to lend the money.

The vision is that by the end of this stage, the following goals will have been met:China’s economic and technological strength has increased significantly. China has become a global leader in innovation.The rights of the people to participate and to develop as equals are adequately protected. The rule of law for the country, the government, and society is basically in place. Institutions in all fields are further improved; the modernization of China’s system and capacity for governance is basically achieved.Social etiquette and civility are significantly enhanced. China’s cultural soft power has grown much stronger; Chinese culture has greater appeal.People are leading more comfortable lives, and the size of the middle-income group has grown considerably. Disparities in urban-rural development, in development between regions, and in living standards are significantly reduced; equitable access to basic public services is basically ensured; and solid progress has been made toward prosperity for everyone.A modern social governance system has basically taken shape, and society is full of vitality, harmonious, and orderly.There is a fundamental improvement in the environment; the goal of building a Beautiful China is basically attained.2、In the second stage from 2035 to the middle of the 21st century, we will, building on having basically achieved modernization, work hard for a further 15 years and develop China into a great modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced, harmonious, and beautiful. By the end of this stage, the following goals will have been met:New heights are reached in every dimension of material, political, cultural and ethical, social, and ecological advancement.Modernization of China’s system and capacity for governance is achieved.China has become a global leader in terms of composite national strength and international influence.Common prosperity for everyone is basically achieved.The Chinese people enjoy happier, safer, and healthier lives.The Chinese nation will become a proud and active member of the community of nations.In my opinion, China will start to surpass US in 2035, they hope they could meet this goal before 2050(exactly 2049, it is the 100 year anniversary for nation founding).",19,0.17619825708061004,0.37886710239651417,0.9621292071627451

814,"The U.S. was the chief financier of the rise of Japan via the World Bank and the IMF, but the direction was toward ‘The Triangle: Taiwan, South Korea and Japan. A weak economy in any of those countries was seen as perhaps facilitating a Communist direction, which was an active political party in Japan, and practiced to some degree in early Taiwan.The World Bank and the EIB provided Japan with a significant amount of capital in the years before 1960, accounting for more than 60 percent of the total capital flow to Japan during that period (MITI, 1990). The loans went mainly to the electric-power and steel industries. Beginning in 1956, Japan also received long-term loans from the U.S. Export-Import Bank (EIB). Almost all of the World Bank loans were made to the Japan Development Bank (JDB), a government financial institution, which borrowed on behalf of private companies. prior to the war, Japan had previously been using both Taiwan and Korea (North and South) for industrial manufacturing. After the war, these businesses ‘departed,’ however, particularly for South Korea and Taiwan, the knowledge skills of the native labor force remained.Steel production, and it’s products (bikes, cars, motorcycles), and any application requiring fine labor assembly became the direction through out the ‘Asian Triangle,’ as they became adept at emulating the West. Bi-lateral trade, particularly with Taiwan was as large a market for Japan as was export to the U.S, for many years.An early requirement pressed upon the Japanese by the U.S. was that of women being allowed to vote, and their use in the War-labor force revealed that their skills should be allowed to go further than homemaking. Although pressed-for by the U.S. early on, prostitution wasn't made illegal until 1958; blow-jobs remain legal today.The industrial prowess of first motorcycles (coming in as small, and utilitarian at first) got Japan into the U.S. Market followed by cars that again, were note worthy for being small and utilitarian in nature. Going head-on against markets filled by American companies was avoided, instead, niche markets were exploited. Slowly, appreciation of the robustness of the Japanese designs was appreciated. I recall when small pick-up trucks (Toyota) were adopted by some companies, and the employees were resentful of no longer having their big Fords or Chevies… so they DROVE THE HELL out of the Toyota’s, and the little trucks took the punishment. [ At one point, I recall a City that was allowing purchase of small trucks that had to be U.S. made (Many had Ford, or Chevy on the label). The only small truck at the time being made in the U.S. came from a Volkswagen plant. The San Jose Police force was tired of needing to maintain a trailer in order to retrieve broken down Harley Davidson’s, so they bought Kawasaki’s,- and had no need of the trailer. ]But yes, at that time, as U.S. steel, automobile and even plywood manufactures were being low-balled by superior products out of Japan, and and U.S. employment was definitely impacted. Nationalism, and Union-cheer leading against imports was a common mantra, and a view of a’ Japanese threat’ was popular. Also, then as now, Japan was very quick at copying (stealing) U.S. technology; for example: the Japanese Government would almost completely subsidize the acquisition of NEW American technical items (Lab Equipment, etc.), but the reimbursed’ Japanese buyer was required to allow the new equipment to be taken apart and analyzed by any Japanese R&D groups (eg. Hamamatsu and Shimadzu) came in the door. To my knowledge, this Japanese practice continues. Since the U.S. went through this phase with Japan already, China doesn’t seem to present much more of a threat (‘Same-ol’ same Old’), and none of their products have quality that best’s Japan. Beijing’s activities against the Philippines and dealings with Hong Kong has great interest however.",1,0.08904986007258735,0.37439219030128107,0.8151783132105084

826,"Checkout the World Outlook Report by PwC in the link below.The World in 2050It saysIndia’s global GDP ranking at PPPs by 2050 (behind China but ahead of the US)However you have asked ,How can India surpass Chinese Economy in 10 years?10 years is a very short time.But we still should have some guidelines to go ahead.The two essentials for economic growth are Capital and Productivity.We can manage to muster up money for investment but we lag behind in productivity.Forget about manufacturing, Indians are not even productive in agriculture.I read this on Quora, unfortunately I didn't save the link, nor remember the question or the person who wrote the answer, except it was written by a farmer with substantial farm land in Maharashtra. His son went to USA to study. He visited his son in USA and fell in love with the farm land in USA. He managed to get some land on lease in USA for farming. Now he farms in USA in summers and in India in winters. He has compared the output of farm labourers in India and USA. He says his US agri-worker earns $8 to $10 per hour but has an output equal to 3 or 4 Indian worker. And he was talking about a simple task as picking Okra from a field.What drives the US worker to give better output than the Indian worker. It isn't the money. I don't know what it is. But the only difference between the two workers is that the US worker is a school graduate. Otherwise both workers have the same insecurity of jobs. They do not get to work every day.But we are talking about China. Chinese too are school graduates except in some far flung , remote areas. The agricultural sector is better managed in China. People are alotted land for agriculture according to the size of their family. Originally all produce was bought by the state and there was no private sale. Now farmers are free to sell their produce at market rates. The Chinese agricultural productivity is phenomenal. They use latest techniques in agriculture and are very profitable. Compare that to India. Farmers are burdened by high cost of modern farming inputs which they do not know how to deal with, and end up losing money. Many farmers have given up farming as a profession. They just engage in subsistence farming. They do not sell a single grain of food. All their efforts ends up as zero to the economy.",6,0.11298469387755103,0.45362244897959186,0.6552177614756771
827,"By providing skills to our lakhs of Unemployed youths.If you see Chinese economy growth, they have jumped from agri to manufacturing and then towards service sector whereas We Indians have bypassed manufacturing sector and leaped from agriculture to service sector. The reason for doing so was that we don’t had the required resources in terms of machinery or the skilled labour force during our 80s and 90s. We are now paying a heavy cost because of this because we have nearly 49% of our population dependent on agriculture which is contributing just 16% to our GDP. So the only thing is we have to move out this huge rural population who are dependent on agriculture but since service sectors are mostly white collar jobs we can’t make them to find job there. We need to provide them skills so that during non farming season they can find a job.On the other hand China which adopted one child policy till a few years ago are faced with declining work force, they have more aged population and they can’t be replaced with young labour force. We Indians have nearly 65% of population who are below 35 yrs old age bracket so the space vacated by the Chinese mostly in manufacturing industries like the textile industries or the leather industry needs to captured by Indians and if we have the skilled labour force then it will be easy.

833,"The central government is like any central government, it provides the guidance and goals for the future. Central governments are like the ’corporate board’ of a corporation. They look at strategic opportunities, political direction, and provide guidance to the various divisions (in China’s case divisions equals provinces) If you know how a corporation runs, it’s pretty much how the Chinese government is run. Central governments control the overall budget but the budget is shared with provinces and provinces are perceived like division in that they are to be managed for financial and economic success, same as a corporation would. At one time in China’s experiment on capitalism, provinces had the most power because it created the funds (selling land and resources) and each behaved like separate countries (which was destructive) and caused financial imbalances (think bankruptcy in a normal business sense). The central government was weak because it had no (financial) hammer to deal with the provinces. Today, that condition has given the edge to the central government, so now provinces have to tow the line a bit more and show their competitiveness by their economic performance. Provinces are like profit and loss centers in divisions. Because of the way China is structured politically, she can focus long term, can aim strategically, and be more efficient with resources. In the past corruption diluted efforts and caused some issues, but there were some redeeming things about corruption also. Corruption got things done quicker, with less bureaucratic inefficiency. It was like adding oil to the bearings so the machine ran smoother. The downside was in economics, it cost more to produce or accomplish things. Those on the take, became financial czars on pittances of income. Remember, business people don’t bribe people to lose money, they bribe to make money.

I get why Chinese nationalistic pride wants to believe it, but that wasn’t the average American’s thought process. Americans do not live their regular lives structured around a constant awareness of their country’s power. You as foreigners experience the US that way. Americans don’t. They experience their lives as tenuous, as constantly insecure, and they believe (rightly) that their communities are new and fragile.This actually isn’t propaganda, either.

China trades unfairly with the US, they take advantage of us. Huh? You like bargains so you buy Chinese imports. You make the rules so that Chinese content gets valued at full retail. You claim trade imbalance. Analysts say the average Chinese import only has 50% Chinese content, the rest of the value came from elsewhere, including the US. China gets hosed 100%. If only 50% is China’s content, the $500 billion export number should be $250 billion, about half of what you say it is. You leave out traded services that shows the US has a surplus of $37 billion, that doesn’t get counted. And to top it all, we have a restricted list of items we won’t sell to China.

868,"It’s true that China holds over $3 US trillion of foreign cash reserves, but should Beijing decide to blackmail nations by dumping its reserves, the impact would be catastrophic worldwide and also spark financial disaster in China as well. Unloading foreign reserves would only generate benefits if by chance other nations declare war on China, forcing Beijing to take extreme measures in response.Even the mere threat of unloading foreign reserves without the nation facing the brink of war could also lead to disturbing consequences. Another sovereign nation could call its bluff and if Beijing balks that makes China look weak in the eyes of the world. But if Beijing does push ahead on dumping currencies that would cause the most serious global financial crisis since the Great Depression in the 1930s.Accordingly, the idea of China acting as a bully on account of its foreign reserves holdings does not make sense. Beijing would inflict severe pain on both the world and China markets and hence would not profit from such endeavors. So if you ever hear rumors that Beijing plans to dump its foreign reserves, but a military war is not imminent, then ignore it, since the Chinese government would never be so foolish to resort to such risky tactics during times of peace.But, let’s say China seeks greater influence with its huge holding of foreign reserves. Here’s my suggestion that could create benefits for many sides. Instead of targeting the purchases of US (United States) and EU (European Union) Treasuries, it’s better for Beijing to invest more in the emerging markets in Southeast Asia, South Asia, Central Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America.Despite the high risks of such ventures, China can capture greater diplomatic influence and economic strength in the international community. Meanwhile, the US dollar is valued way too high and American exporters can enjoy greater benefits and opportunities from a lower-valued US dollar compared to other currencies.So let’s take a closer look at a breakdown of China’s foreign reserves, as of March 2018. The Website TradingEconomics posts trends in China’s holdings of foreign reserves. Here is the link:https://tradingeconomics.com/chi...Beijing had reduced its holdings last February after surging to US$3.16 trillion in January. Nevertheless, the Chinese government declared it a “state secret” to disclose details of its specific foreign reserves holdings.According to reports, two-thirds of holdings are the US dollar and and the rest is mainly placed in the euro, British pound and Japanese yen. The currencies are considered stable and strong, but the sovereign governments in charge of those currencies face serious debt challenges.The EU had nearly gone into default when Greece’s economy nearly collapsed about ten years ago. The US, UK and Japan have high loads of debt yields as well. If China chooses to dump its currencies the powerful nations of the world would confront chaos, while the debt time bomb would harm China as well.As noted earlier, a better strategy for China is to focus its efforts on the emerging markets. But if the experts are accurate in their analysis, Beijing has failed to take advantage of the scenario.Nevertheless, Beijing appears to be making some progress with its Belt & Road Initiative, pledging to help participating nations (mainly in the emerging markets) build huge infrastructure projects with financing from the AIIB (Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank) and South-South Cooperation, China’s offer to increase investments and trade between Chinese companies with African and Latin America markets.Therefore, we can anticipate more deal-making between China and the Emerging Markets down the road.Tmcgregorchina@yahoo.comWeChat: 86 1343978718Twitter: @tmcgregorchinahttp://english.cctv.com/special/...",33,0.06427777777777778,0.3545317460317459,0.9000056576996346

873,"In the past, China and Russia have had a ‘hate/love’ connection. Today, it is love because both China and Russia see that they complement each other quite well. Russia is strong in fuel resources, grain, and theoretical/military technologies. China is strong in manufacturing and applications development. These synergies bring together two giants that when combined could produce a competition to world economics that would dwarf a weakening American -European alliance.The fact of the matter is, today, we see Europe, especially Germany moving closer to Russia/China. Trumps declared isolationist policy may give the US a ‘losing’ economic position with world economies. China and Germany, on a technical basis, see each other complementing each other and sees synergies with collaborative projects. The latest is the jet engine that China developed and Germany wants to further develop in Europe. What you see in these alliances is a leap forward in technologies in a broad front. Trump’s trade war with China only accelerates the economic decline for future US-China collaboration and dialogue. The political environment is moving swiftly these days. China is becoming the center of commerce in Asia. Vietnam and India are wooed by the US on the military front, but they are holding the US at arms length. Our posturing to gain military encampments has, so far, yielded nothing. Vietnam has just made peace with China over the South China Sea, in spite of American support of Vietnam in her position on the Sea. India, seems to be shying away from collaborating with the US. Her recent purchase of arms from Russia and France point to rejection of attempted US partnership with India. What Asians know and Trump seems oblivious of, is trade intereconnects nations because it is a large part of their GDP, especially for developing nations.The BRI by China perfectly fits the paragam for a China-SE Asia-Central Asia-Europe-Russia trade interconnectivity by sea and land. As a core initiative, it can extend sea routes to the Americas, Africa, and Australia/New Zealand. The BRI only amplifies trade importance. It also creates reasons for developing countries not to seek wars. At a time where America should be part and parcel of these world projects, where America should be leading in a peaceful rise to world economies, it would seem we have turned out back against the rest of the world. We have made enemies in Europe, Africa, Russia, China, and the Middle East.Free trade has become so entrenched and integrated into world economies that our attempt to change the rules is being met with resistance and chaos. Russia sees this as an opportunity to be on the winning side. Russia’s closer alignment with Europe and China, her developing relationships in the Middle East, and her impact on the world in general, seem more peaceful than the Russia of the past and the US of the present. Amazing how Trump has turned the world upside down and America is ending up on the losing end.Russia’s economic success will be intricately tied to China. Did you know that 10 years ago, Russia-China trade was negligible, today it is $80 billion, and analyst say it will be $200 billion in a few years. Oil and gas lines from Russia will be flowing. Cross border trade is thriving and will expand. Russia/China joint ventures on a wide-body passenger jet will lead to other joint-venture projects, Russia/China tourism is rising. So, barring any catastrophic event, this marriage of economic interdependence may have a long way to go.“Bilateral trade between China and Russia has skyrocketed this year and is expected to reach US$80 billion by the end of 2017, an increase of over 30 percent year-on-year………The trade relationship between China and Russia can be expected to develop significantly further. China is currently negotiating a free trade agreement with the Eurasian Economic Union, a Central Asian trade bloc that also includes Kazakhstan to China’s west, Russia, and Belarus, which borders the EU. When finalized, it will have the effect of bringing Chinese goods, duty free, to markets across Russia and to the very borders of the EU itself.Beijing is also working with Moscow in building a high-speed freight rail link between the two cities, which should be operational by 2019. China and Russia are also exploring the development of the Northern Sea Passage, an Arctic route that, when feasible, will considerably reduce maritime transit times between China and Europe. Not surprisingly, northern European countries such as Finland and the Baltic nations are already putting infrastructure development plans to cater for this, including a projected Arctic Corridor that would see rail extend from Helsinki up to Kirkenes on the Arctic Ocean.As part of its Russian strategy, China has also been busy in assisting Eastern European nations get up to speed with technological developments, and in particular with the coming launch of 5G and related e-commerce technologies. Both China and Russia are some way ahead of the EU in the development of this. China has been making overtures to Europe’s 16 eastern nations to examine better collaboration and cooperation between them, Russia, and China itself…China and Russia are also getting together on standardization, including over logistics and transportation issues such as rail containerization. Underscoring their IT superiority, the two countries also rank first and second, respectively, as the world’s best IT developers. Chinese programmers outscore all other countries in mathematics, functional programming, and data structures challenges, while Russians dominate in algorithms, the most popular and competitive arena. This has very specific implications as the world moves into a more IT-driven universe and with special attention to e-commerce and the new supporting businesses that developments such as 5G and Blockchain will bring.The China-Russia plans may go further still. Both Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin have openly discussed the possibility of uniting Eurasia and developing something known as the Great Eurasian Partnership. This concept brings together the members of the Eurasian Economic Union, Shanghai Co-Operation Organization, and ASEAN as a huge free trade bloc:” http://www.china-briefing.com/ne...So, Russia is not jealous of China’s growth. Russia will be an integral partner in this growth. They are collaborating more and integrating both nations in infrastructure, technology, information technology, and manufacturing projects. If China’s long range plans succeed, the entire European to Asian continent will be interconnected, not only with logistic routes, but economic development, inter-connectivity, and energy transport.“Business\EconomyRussia and China in the 21st century.

Although, now that China has elected their leader to life, now his friends will be in the front seat probably for life. I will be honest, it is not the right direction. Because the Chinese leadership changed in the past, the friends of the leader at that time would have a great time, for a time, until the next leader came in and ‘purged’ the people he did not trust. Those that were rich and powerful suddenly became shamed overnight. Now that is no more and will gradually begin to lool more like Russia in the coming years I fear.In Russia, anyone would is the friend of Putin is wealthy. It always has been since he rose to power and will always be whilst he is there. Russia is one of the most unequal countries on the planet. Because Putin has been in power for so long, his friends have grown wealthy beyond belief for buying cheap national natural resources and controlling them. It must be noted however, that despite being so wealthy, that does not make them an exception to Putin’s wrath when he is displeased. There are many tales of mutli-millionaires and billionaires dying in uncertain circumstances.They are both theoretically market economies, but both are oppressors of free speech and dissident. One has historically ‘recycled’ it’s plutocrats, the other less often and far more violently.Russia has been embroiled in the past of the cold war for too long, taking it’s own side against every other free nation on the planet and this has held them back somewhat as sactions have crippled their economy gradually.Meanwhile, China realised that it should drive immense growth to catch up to other developed nations, and also noted that it had the resources and man power to achieve this. I mentioned that they have borrowed vast amounts of land in Africa to feed their population in the future, as well as taking advantage of a lack of a strong governance in Africa to kinda rob the Africans of valuable natural resources.In terms of the world stage, China takes with money and wealth, Russia with lives.",2,0.15477357609710551,0.562359943977591,0.9959325691770333

899,"1 Background Yes, I think it probably is. Let’s look at the evidence for that assertion.2 Two Different Possible Government Priorities in Running An EconomyGovernments can eitherrun their economies for the benefit of their rich elite (and historically most economies have been run that way) orrun their economies for the benefit of most of their working people.3 The Structure of Economic DemandThe rich in an economy are between 1% to 10% of the people in an economy and their demand for goods and services is seldom more than twice the normal average worker level.The workers in an economy are between 99% and 90% of the people in an economy and their effective demand is usually between 50% to 70% of the annual effective demand in GDP.3 The Economic Effects of Each of These Policies3.1 The USA and the UK : Since 1980 These Two Economies Have Been Historically and Are Now Operated For the Benefit of the RichThe equation of national income isNY =C+ I+G whereNY= National IncomeC=ConsumptionI =Investment andG =Government expenditureThe table below shows these three figures (C, I and G) for the USA, the UK and China.From the above table you can immediately see that both the USA and the UK are high consumption, low investment, low-growth economies. The official policy of both governments is an Austerity squeeze for the majority of their workers combined with tax cuts for the rich, many of whom rapidly relocate their increase in income to the residual British “treasure islands” to avoid taxation. About half of the annual increase in national income is now allocated to the rich and this creates a lack of investment capital, high interest rates despite very low CB base rates and low innovation levels in both countries. Both the USA and the UK have persistent and significant balance of payments problems, with the USA importing about 2.9% more than it exports, and with the UK having a negative BoP of about 1.6% of GDP.It takes a large mount of fixed capital in both the USA and the UK to produce an extra 1% of GDP growth - the Capital-Output Ratio is 7.8 in the USA and 9.8 in the UK.The triumph of the invalid and impractical castle in the air of Washington Consensus /monetarism/financialisation/neoclassical/ neoliberal macroeconomics means that neither the rulers nor the ruled nor their academics nor their media have the faintest idea about how to reverse their accelerating economic decline. Trump’s solutions - isolationism and protectionism - are no valid answers. Brexit is the British version of isolationism and will be an economic disaster.Running the economy for the benefit of the rich leads to a spiral of economic decline and to the increasing impoverishment of the majority of its workers. The dot com economy employs few people and does not create the widespread local prosperity that a productive manufacturing industry can.3.3 China Where Most Growth Benefits Its WorkersThe Shimomuran economy of China is entirely different. First, the Public Bank of China creates no-cost investment credit of about 25% pa for productive purposes.The Government receives a tax take of about 30% of that created credit once it is spent, so receives an annual addition to their revenue of about 7.5% of GDP.Chinese consumption can rise at at almost 7% a year, capital expenditure and government expenditure at about the same rate. The balance of payments runs at a surplus of about 1.9% of GDP.During the last four decades China has grown at an average rate of GDP growth initially equal to about four times and more recently about three times that of the USA. No end to that process is in sight.4 ConclusionsThe current American and British Governments have, whether they realised it or otherwise, chosen relative economic decline because that is an inevitable consequence of running the country for the benefit of the rich.The numbers of the rich are far too small to generate the enormous levels of invention and innovation which are dormant in the working population. One of the major reasons FDR won the Second World War was because he created a FED-financed banking-for-SME system which mobilised the ingenuity, inventiveness and innovation of millions of the American people. Practical intelligence is distributed everywhere among the people and sometimes far too little of it is visible in the ruling class.To turn the economy into a production system for the financial preference of the rich is a political choice which results in economic decline.During the last four decades China has grown at an average rate of about three to four times that of the USA. No end to that process is in sight.The Chinese Government by practising Shimomuran no-cost investment credit economics have produced rapidly rising living standards for all of its people and is by far the best example of how to achieve rapid economic growth.",28,0.11832393483709273,0.395375939849624,0.6772653514454621

Admittedly, for several decades its government was authoritarian, which is somewhat difficult to avoid while a nation is underdeveloped, but Singapore’s political climate has been gradually opening up during the past decade or two.Singapore has an effective education system, far better than China’s.To my knowledge (and I have visited Singapore), Singapore has not caused undue environmental damage, whereas China has created an enormous environment problem.Singapore’s economy is rather well-balanced; China’s isn’t.

906,"Ok. Shall we do the math? China's trade surplus with the US represent less than 3% of GDP (2.7% to be exact). Total exports is around 3.7%. So even if exports go completely to zero (which it can't for reasons I will explain later), the impact is not that significant.Now lets look at the composition of goods that China exports. For those who think it is steel and aluminium, think again. China's exports to US consists largely of electronics (consumer and intermediate) and mechanical intermediate products. Lets look at electronics: China produces 51pct of all electronic goods in the world. In other words, they produce more than all of the world combined. In the last few decades, US production capacity has already been hollowed out. How long do you think it takes for them to rebuild? 5 years? 10 years? And how about the skill set? So the immediate effect will be much higher prices for Americans rather than a sudden shiftnto domestic production. The same applies to most of the other goods that China exports. Volumes might drop a little but certainly not zero. And to make things more complicated, some part of the electronics export have imported intermediate components (even from the US) so net impact to China is further reduced.And to counter those still living in the 90s, China no longer exports cheap goods. They exports a lot of tech and intermediate goods, and is the most critical supply chain link GLOBALLY. And their capital goods exports are growing in leaps and bounds.Now lets look at China's imports from the US and see what China's tariffs against them would do. The biggest is clearly soy beans. With a tariff imposed, soy bean imports from US will likely drop while prices globally will rise. But when you understand soy beans are largely used for feedstock, then you would understand that it is substitutable. With the largest wheat producer next door along with Brazil's ability to makeup for any shortfall from the US, I suspect the price impact will be somewhat mitigated.The importance of the US market has declined a lot in the last decade. And it will continue to decline. if the US decides to start a trade war with China, the only people they will hurt significantly are US consumers.",24,0.06977891156462585,0.4074829931972789,0.9655673510864986

908,"Stop whistling in the wind.The Chinese economy will be devastated. Almost as much as the US economy. All but the most developed economies are damaged so badly that people die of starvation and malnutrition-related diseases and the child mortality rate goes back to the level seen before 1980.Assuming this current fight escalates and significantly damages trade between the US and China, the opening salvo will take a few points off the growth rate for each nation. While each economy is growing, China is growing much faster, but the affect of economic dislocation is relative to a nation’s expectations, so the point lost on top for the US compared to the 2 or 3 points lost by China will have a stronger affect on China.Then we get to the second round, as other nations choose sides and try to protect their favorite home industries. Protectionism is economic cancer. Both nations are built on trade, so with this geographic widening of the trade war, both would be devastated; the US would go back into recession, and China would go to no growth. Since it is relative to a population’s expectations, China, in particular, would face far-ranging and unpredicted political and economic dislocation.Third round: efficiency losses. This is the big one. Loss of trade is the invasion of North Africa; loss of efficiency is Stalingrad and Kursk. It is a bottomless pit of economic backtracking with uncountable casualties. Example: You had six giant factories building mobile devices in China. Suddenly, you have a 10% drop in that industry. Inventories are built up for the higher sales level and you cut manufacturing severely to get to correct inventory levels. Workers are laid off, not by 10% but rather by a third.Profit levels decrease, so workers in the front office are also laid off. Their dry cleaners, auto mechanics, waiters, bank tellers etc. have also to be laid off as the loss of internal economic activity leave most businesses fighting for survival.It stabilizes at the production plants after two or three rounds of big layoffs, but now they are serving a smaller economy from a large, expensive plant. The price must increase, so all worker’s paycheck does not stretch as far. And more community workers are laid off. Tax revenues fall off, and public employees are laid off.In rival nations, smaller, less efficient plants take up the slack. Prices rise there too. Money is short at the household level too. Local workers are laid off. These industries are under the protectionist umbrella so they no longer have any incentive for efficiency and for decades after, nations implode into recession or depression as their decrepit industries fail.So China goes from strong growth to the inverse, recession. Possibly a deep recession. The US drops from recession to depression.Now we are suffering. Both nations’ citizens were expecting an ever improving life. Governments would fall (this is how Trump became President). Small nations with weak economies tank. People go without, even to starving. Millions die.TENS OF MILLIONS DIE!This trade war is stupid and dangerous. Both sides need to make concessions. If I were President, I would ask China to place an export fee on steel (which can be collected by China and used to fund China’s infrastructure initiative in the third world) and to drop the 25% import tariff on some part of the US auto industry, say pick-up trucks and similarly sized SUVs (Jeep Cherokees).

Also there has been a major push to export to markets like southeast Asia, Middle East, Russia, Latin America, and Africa. For the last few years China has been funding infrastructure projects to develop the economies of southeast Asia and Africa so they have the money to buy Chinese goods.The other thing to consider is that factories go into and out of business all the time, and a lot of the factories people think if when they think Chinese factory went out of business a few years ago.One thing is that I find that Americans are often scarily out of touch with what is going on with the world.

It is NOT a situation where the U.S. and China have been treating each other equally and fairly — and then suddenly Trump picks a fight with a mercantile-type scheme. Instead, China has not allowed “fair” trade on a broad spectrum of issues. Trump is trying to develop a position where China will eventually make a few concessions (which may be more token than substantial), and then Trump and China will cease the rhetoric and retaliatory moves. This outcome probably has a 90% of being realized.

Refrain from presenting the data without consent, I hereby just present his conclusion:US chose the targets so that the tariff is not going to significantly affect US economy. Chinese suppliers only take a small fraction of the total US imports in the 1′333 items involved.If the tariff is applied, the author estimates that US imports from China would be reduced-exactly what Mr. Trump has promised-except that it comes at the expense of negative contribution to US overall trade balance, assuming that Chinese products are going to be replaced by other foreign suppliers instead of the domestic manufactuers (if there’s any).China will probably lose nearly half of exports to US on the 1′333 items, costing 600–800 thousand jobs. The possible damage is limited by the fact that among all these 1′333 items, US is only account for 15% of Chinese exports.China’s retaliation has taken a quite different strategy.

920,"I believe that China will make a better world power than the United States.Here are my reasons:Tangible results vs color of the catChina has a period of communism but is now as capitalistic as any other country. China focuses its resources on producing tangible results for itself and its neighbors. China’s foreign policies are therefore predictable and steady as it goes since it is based on economic consideration which anyone can calculate on his own.The United States on the other hand is made up of visibly overlapping kingdoms so that whichever voice is the loudest will win for the moment. At the time when the Middle East is experiencing extreme volatility, President Trump still sees it right to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.World connectivityChina is increasing its connectivity with its neighbors by rail, road and air. There are railways and highways running from China outwards through Kazakhstan, Pakistan, Myanmar and so on.Meanwhile the United States are wasting billions of dollars of its taxpayer’s money building a wall on its border with Mexico.System of governanceChina uses dialogue and team learning similar to the Six Thinking Hats whereas the United States uses the argument method to make sure than everybody has a chance to block action. So what takes China one sitting with around 3,000 delegates all in one general assembly to make major reforms, the United States will need to go fifteen rounds in a boxing ring between the White House, Congress, House of Representatives, the Judiciary, their lobbyists, Wall Street, the vocal public and their media people.Plan long termThe Chinese accepts its culture of putting community above self. The Chinese view their country as the larger family. The leaders reciprocate by taking care of individual citizens. In such a paradigm, China can make long term plans.The United States on the other hand idolizes the self over community. So every few years, they would like to change their leaders when they don’t like them any more.World supportChina believes that world peace and prosperity are economic issues that can best be achieved by economic activities.The United States on the other hand believes that the ideological struggle is very important no matter how many countries are suffering because of the lack of economic development.Over time, nations begin to judge for themselves which approach will serve the world better. Therefore, when the United States pulls out of the Iran nuclear deal, only Israel is visibly very happy. But most of the countries and the United Nations disapprove of the US action.When the United States moves its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, only a small country Guatemala makes a similar move.

(Another emperor, Emperor Yang of Sui, was condemned in history and it was mainly because of his wars, raging taxes etc, many other ‘sins’ were added to him, but history scholars attributed his downfall to the wars (which caused much sufferings).)Here is another Chinese guy speaking on US television, interesting that he had also mentioned ‘wars’:If you match his comments to the Chinese history I had just described above, I think you can feel a little of the Chinese culture.

I cannot stress enough how important this is to American military strength.

The US's allies that host bases put Americans front and center to the world, for better or worse. China would need something similar to truly gain hegemony.Develop a strong officer and nco corps.

In contrast to previous bluster where Trump claimed it would be easy to win a trade war, top US officials are now backpedaling and calling for negotiations.As Bloomberg reported yesterday, the following exports are included in China's tariffs: cranberries, mainly grown in Paul Ryan's home state of Wisconsin; whiskey, associated with Mitch McConnell's Kentucky; and oranges where the swing state of Florida is the biggest exporter. That is not including the big guns on soybeans, autos and beef that would hit the Midwest hard, namely the states that went to Trump.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/a...Evidently, China right now is the only country in the world that has the economic heft to influence and decide elections in the US with their trade policies.

927,"“How would the USA tariffs on Chinese goods impact the economy of the EU?”It’s possible the US tariffs on Chinese goods, and reciprocal Chinese tariffs on US goods may lead to a net decrease in US-Chinese trade. In that case the Chinese may find ways to increase trade with the EU (as well as expanding trade with countries in Latin America, Africa, and Asia). The EU might also reduce trade with the US, because of tariffs, and increase trade with China.In the short run, any loss of trade is a disruption and bad for the economy. it takes time to establish new trading relationships to replace those that are damaged. In the somewhat longer run, the economies of china and the EU will grow. Each will benefit from increased trading with the other. Only the US economy will, on average, be hurt. Some areas will be hurt more than others. And the profits of some companies protected by tariffs may increase.

928,"I’ll throw in a contrarian wildcard. NO. We will create our own failure or demise. Only when we in the US, work together constructively and for benefits not only to themselves, but their neighbors, will attributes of success come about. We live in a shared integrated world and only positives add. Destruction, conflict, and political polarization subtract. Whether one likes it or not, Americans tend to have a racists/religious intolerance streak. All one has to do is to look at our history and see the stains of racism and religious intolerance in our short history of life as a nation. This is a measure of our lack of confidence in ourselves and our insecurity. While we advertise freedom, democracy, religious tolerance, and political diversity, all have been part of a never ending conflict of differences. This, above all, is a drag on America and her ideals. Racism and religious intolerance are drains on progress.If history is to be repeated, China serves as that reference. Over the course of several millennia, China went from warring states to what some call a ‘civilization state’, a homogeneous polyglot of various tribes into what the Chinese call themselves as the ‘Han’ race and a nation called China. It is this homogeneousness and focus on a ‘harmonious’ and peaceful citizenry that keeps China focused and efficient in both economic and social order. It is the parts of China that are different from the Han demography, that China has it’s greatest challenge to domestic harmony today.So, what is the US today? In it’s short history of 232 years, America continues to be a melting pot of diversity. People of different ethnic, religious, and political beliefs make for a ‘unharmonious’ mix. Our racism and religious intolerance add fuel to the fire of progress. Diversity has strength in broader views and openness, but it has it’s dark side of conflict and polarization. If China’s history rings true for the US, it might take at least a millenium before this mix cools down and coalesses into a harmonious population. It is this harmoniousness or ‘working together’ that has contributed to China’s efficiency and effectiveness in moving such a large population into a positive concentrated direction of unity for national growth and progress. It is the focus reason that China’s leaders have emphasized for China’s concentrated efforts for success today and for tomorrow.For America, democracy creates a catalytic, amplifying effect that tends to polarize and distend actions and policies of state. Because of this, China’s intended peaceful rise is often viewed as a threat. Our government over it’s young history sees military power as the solution to make the world more homogeneous in the mold of a western-Christian-Democratic characteristic. Of which China bends to but is not. Our mantra of freedom, free speech, religious tolerance, and political diversity are only correct when viewed through our lens. Those that don’t are crushed until nothing is left or the conquered people submit.This was China’s history, over 2000 years ago, during the warring states period. Now, instead of one continent, the US views it’s mandate as a world contagion. In this melee of different political and economic thought, we now have a unmanageable leadership that throws uncertainty into the wind of progress. Trump’s calculus has divided the country and the world more than any president in our history. If anyone or anything that will cause the ruin of the US, it is his careless leadership that will lead to our ruin. One day, he wants war, the next peace, today a country is our friend, tomorrow it is the enemy, our long-lived alliances are shattering, our political will to stay in the forefront of technology are sliding into an abyss, our direction is towards isolationism and facism, and not global continuity. It is not China that will ruin the US economy, it is US leadership that could ruin the US economy. China will continue her economic rise with or without America as part of that rise.What we Americans don’t realize is our industrial and economic might comes from the fact that WW1 and WW2 utterly destroyed Europe and Asia, while America’s industrial complex not only grew, but remained intact. With the economic implosion of Russia, the US was the hegemon of the world. Now the world has recovered and we are in a competitive economic race with the rest of the world, a challenge we created with our ‘free trade’ globalization policies. We did so for our own interests, but today, the world has healed its war wounds and is striving to find their place in today’s world. The genie is out of the bottle, so to speak. America needs to stay the course as a strong moral and economic leader and not as a military hegemon. Our horrendous expenditure on militarism is money not spent on our domestic and social needs.

930,"Yes. China could totally decimate the American economy. It would not however do that by putting on tariffs. That would merely slow down the economy or slowly create a recession in America.The main way that China could do this is by selling all American bonds at once, in a very short space of time. Right now they are only considering scaling back the buying of American bonds. Not even stopping the buying of them.What would happen if 10% of America's outstanding bonds were sold at once? Well first of all nobody would be big enough to buy them. Secondly by selling so much it would obviously depreciate the value of the bonds and make it less enticing for others to even hold it, so they might sell it too.Meanwhile the USD would totally nosedive.America's thirst for consumption bodes well for China's goal of fast growth and industrialization. America sells China bonds and China sells America goods. The trouble is that from an American's eyes, the growth given to America may not seem worth it (2/3% against China's 20% in the height of the boom) but the system worked well for both for so long…until it didn't.But it is not in China's interest to do that as the U.S. is China's biggest market for exports.

932,"Yes and no.China export to USA is around $500B, but about half of that is Korean, Japan, Taiwan and USA components. USA GDP is around $20T. The damage of trade war to either side is small.China holds between $1T to $3.5T of USA bonds. In theory, if China dumps these bonds all at once, China can disturb the USA market. The USA stocks are over $60T, so the effects are limited. Furthermore, the Fed can print more money or to buy the bonds to limit if not eliminate all impacts. Trump talked about not honoring the US bonds hold by China. Such move will collapse USA economy immediately and permanently.China can somewhat affect USA economy as all USA low-end manufacturing has relocated to China, such as clothing and shoes. However, China has moved up in labor costs and many of these factories have moved to Bangladesh and Indonesia. Limiting exports will be inconvenient but will not harm USA economy.In case of a full-blown trade war and USA kicked China out of WTO, China can damage USA high tech industry by totally ignore all IP rights. China can reverse engineer many USA products but not the high-end stuffs. Again, these IP impacts are severe but survivable.Having said that, China can severely damage USA economy.

Many Chinese companies have ADR and are partially owned by Americans and mutual funds.China attacking the small farmers is pointless. News articles focused on tariff on soy beans to hurt the voters of Trump, but nobody mentioned that the soy bean processing factories in China are owned by Americans.The claim by Trump that China is stealing from USA is a fake news. The reality is that every company in China is trying to increase sales to USA. Few American company bothers to increase sales to China.China can hurt Trump badly by attacking the supporters of Republicans.

943,"The answer given here is nice, however it did not deal with Nigerian's most greatest challenge. Someone indicated control of parliament. The Parliament is a part of the government so probably what you meant by ""government control of parliament"" could be Executive having a strong control over Legislative, by making such suggestion it is clear that you believe the challenge faced by Nigeria is mainly from legislative arm of government.I want us to understand that such a control if placed on the wrong hands(leader) would lead the country to civil war. Nigeria is a nation strongly controlled by tribal sentiment. A retired military general currently accused the military of not being neutral in respect to the current Fulani versus middle belt crisis. Right or wrong as the claim may be, it is clear that Nigerian leaders are also affected by this tribal sentiment. As much as it is good to emulate China, for Nigeria to move forward she should look within and try to see where are major challenge is coming from. Too much power to the executive(Authoritarian rule) may have worked in China does not mean it will work in Nigeria.If Nigeria as a nation can conquer tribal sentiment(especially amongst its elites) a strong tool militating against her growth then a strong challenge would have been conquered. So firstly tribal sentiment should be fought against by the President.Secondly I do not not agree to the idea of sending the unemployed to the farm as a strategy.

951,"TL DR: Shared interest.Imperialism has evolved tremendously over the past century.Small backgroundInitially it was blatant. New powers like Germany/Japan felt the only way to upstage the established colonial powers, were to march their armies across continents and seize territories by brute force.Then it’s the cold war. USA/USSR establishing spheres of influence through post war occupation, aids and alliances, fighting small ideological wars in the frontiers of their blocs. Mutual assured destruction (MAD) restricted conventional warfare to just proxy wars.When the USA rose to be the sole superpower, they maintained their global dominance through cultural (with English as the gluing medium), economic (with USD as the central of international exchange), social (the American dream), ideological (democracy and capitalism), and military (with huge military spending and foreign bases etc) superiority - etc.However, some perceive the US dominance as unfair, skewed in US’s favor, with the US willing to rewrite the rules as she seemed fit.Shared interestChina is trying to sell a system whereby everyone minds their own business, but are inter-connected by trade. This creates the condition where nobody tells anyone what to do, yet are bind together by mutual interest.As such, she is willing to work with non-democratic regimes (or those with human rights violations), and generally maintains a policy of political non-interference (unless of course, they’re issues that she deems as her inherent right - like TW).Of course there’s also the one belt one road initiative, with her own financial institutions set up for this purpose (AIIB).Such a long term approach to things (investing in wilderness, politically unstable regimes with little hopes of recouping the investment, at least in the short term) is something that’s unlikely to happen in a free market, capitalist approach.All the while she tries to portray herself as a socially responsible world player, with her commitment to environmental efforts and her stand against trade protectionism. In areas like renewable esp, you wouldn’t be surprise to see them taking the lead in future.ConclusionWhether this new form of imperialism will work in future is anyone’s guess. But one thing is certain is that imperialism will continue to evolve as the world becomes ever more sophisticated and inter-connected.",5,0.030396599927849936,0.45500090187590186,0.9948021625559038
952,"Wikepedia defines Imperialism as follows:“Imperialism is an action that involves a nation extending its power by the acquisition of inhabited territory. It may also include the exploitation of these territories, an action that is linked to colonialism.

The US is generally regarded as a “neo-imperialist” country; it exploits and influences (and helps) other countries but does not colonize them in the classic (European) sense.China will probably show neo-colonialist behavior, but will do so with soft power.

955,"There is factual evidence of the positive Chinese impact on African economies, but there is no single comprehensive study that presents all the evidence in one place.However, there is an excellent website, run by the world’s leading authority on Chinese investment (most of Chinese ‘aid’ is actually investment), called China in Africa: the Real Story. Subscribe to it and watch in amazement as Professor Brautigam’s PhD students trek to the farthest corners of Africa to verify the claims about Chinese activities across the continent. Here’s an example of what they discover:“A $60 billion Chinese infrastructure fund established in 2016?” CARI says: “No way.”First off, the article states: ""Last year, China established a new $60 billion fund to finance infrastructure projects in Africa, mostly with Chinese lending."" Nothing like this exists. The article could be referring to the combined ""pledges"" made by China during the December 2015 Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) in Johannesburg, South Africa. This is how FOCAC officially described the pledges: ""Of the total 60 billion dollars, 5 billion is offered as aid gratis and interest-free loans, 35 billion of concessional loans and export credits, with increased preference; 5 billion of investment augmentation into the China-Africa Development Fund and Special Loans for Development of Small and Medium Enterprises in Africa, respectively, and the initial 10 billion for foundation of the China-Africa Capacity Cooperation Fund [for industrial investment].""[i] Thus, the US$60 billion does not constitute a single fund and it is not focused on infrastructure. It includes a host of financial instruments, including loans, grants and investments.infrastructure is welcome, but as projects made possible by loans — financed by the Chinese — they have saddled the economy with debt.And here’s Prof. Brautigam talking about what’s really happening there:There is another authority who can help us understand the impact of Chinese investment in Africa, Dambisa Moyo, the Oxford University PhD, who is African and who recently spent half an hour alone with President Xi, discussing development aid. Since President Xi has a PhD in rural developmental marketization, it must have been a great conversation. Dr. Moyo’s book, Dead Aid, shows that Chinese aid has done more good for Africa in ten years than Western aid in 100 years. Here’s Dr. Moyo herself:",162,0.13545995670995672,0.26666666666666666,0.9380698022774507
956,"Not sure these are “development theories” as such, but here are some featuresWhen China opened up, it was investment driven, so just allowing in “Open Door”, just tax concessions as incentives.Special regions incentives to direct investment to special zones, so that industries are built up in certain areas and not spread out, help develop infrastructures, plan the transportation/roads etc, water and waste treatments etc.KPI’s (key performance index) for local officials, developing economics, attracting funds being the top considerations for the KPI, as a result top officials were good businessmen.Later on it was the East-West and the inland, so to encourage the industries to move to less developed areas, with cheaper labour. (It would be a “win win”, and wise move anyway, but the government would help to drive and speed up this process)Then come the “Scientific Development/Growth” thinking. … led right from the top during Hu’s term, instead of blindly growing, economic/ industrial growth needs to be ‘scientific’ (also have non-economic items such as environmental controls etc in mind, yes China was serious about such things too!)Progressive emissions, wastes targets/quotas set, some incentives/subsidies for improving environment including very heavy fines. (Just for example, small size coal fired plants were closed down, smallest first, also power plants using rubbish as fuel built with incentive burning rubbish) Certainly not profit driven!Minimum wages, salary increase targets were set, and policies help to achieve these. Results: labour intensive industries forced to improve productivity, labour intensive industries discouraged, high value added encouraged, China developing its middle class narrowing rich-poor gap. In the same time, other rural developments took place and actually more rural worker stayed home (well, even when the factory wages were growing)Incentives for R&D, for attracting high value and scientific experts, maybe further incentive if from overseas, special quarters for experts or high value employees (may not be subsidized as such, but government put up the cash to build them, and only rent out at costs or low profits)Building of more scientific industrial parks with corresponding environmental targets, with better planned waste disposal and water treatments, better planned transportation and residential areas …etcI think in the beginning it was mainly letting in, and then drawing more capital in, and later on discouraging labour intensive and encouraging high value added, and high R&D (also result in high value added). There is also a social and environmental agenda, not everything for profit.Another feature is that China is a communist/socialist country, the Government does not allow sweat shops and ill treatment of workforce. [There maybe some bad employers but even that, it would not amount to slavery level, they cannot hold the people and if we think about it, even so high paying plants have difficulties recruiting workers, also when you think workers are travelling miles away from home, and every year (Chinese New Year they go home) there’s a ‘change period’ people left factories and rejoining or changing factories, workers are very free to choose where and who they work for… if you ask the businessmen, factory owners of your own country, they can confirm this. So, to sum up, government do not run sweat shop, illegal ‘sweat shops’ at least not ‘slavery bad’ … the worst illegal factories in China no way close to the true ‘slavery’ factories (illegal immigrants with their passports withheld and truly imprisoned) in some countries.]The other thing is the subsidies for the “dumping” industries, if they provide incentives, the incentives are for all, including the foreign companies, they all know what ‘incentives’ are given and they enjoy the same incentives, incentives also not ‘industry specific’, Chinese government does not heavily subsidize heavy loss making companies. One example, solar panels, listed companies are making profits now, and 20% gross margin, prices are what we call ‘commodity’ prices (i.e. very narrow range between highest and lowest when both have the same industrial standard) how come something with a large gross margin become a “dumping” when they are shipped to the USA even with the shipping costs? Why? just because the costs are too cheap, so “the Government must have subsidized them” “if we assume they have the same costs as, say, Singapore in a similar industry …” well just politics but please don’t imply “evil” or “fairness” !！So, I believe that the PRC government has been planning the growth sensibly also with social (also socialist) and environmental considerations. It does not use ‘sweat shops’ and does not ‘conspire’ or use ‘unfair’ means to achieve growth. There are individual cases of illegal practices in China just like in other countries, but not the results of conspiracy between the PRC Government and the ‘evil bosses’. These industries were small scale and do not really contribute to the Chinese economy. Any large, successful industries in China can stand up to scrutiny with their workforce in good conditions and environmental standards intact.",2,0.023463917820353473,0.43434879202205945,0.9981318864250449

I think he is listening to people ,like the owner of NewsMax and the National Enquirer. Trump also seems that Trump trusts Fox news more than he trusts the people he hired. It is just conceivable that Trump has been getting really bad briefing.Lack of patience. Like President Reagan, Trump wants his briefings short and simple. He likes briefings less than one page. that means Trump really does not understand many nuances. Unlike Reagan, however, Trump is not smart enough to hire good advisors, let them handle the day to day details then monitor the process closely.Does not care. If I were a betting man, here is where I would place my bet. One thing the President follows are polls. Trump has been hearing every day what the Congressional generic ballot looks like — bad for Republicans. Trump knows the off year special elections have been disastrous for him — forget his party. Mike Pence has done the smart thing and committed to lots of campaigning for Republicans. President Trump however lacks this smart option and is committed to mobilizing his 15% base.Why China? President Trump has been looking at polls not policy. At first he tried to say he was championing steel. Then he learned that America’s biggest steel exporter is — Canada. It is hard to inspire animus toward those maple syrup eating, Molson’s sipping people who kick our asses at curling. Trump also learned that his first foray with protectionism with cut more Midwest jobs than it saves. So Trump is trying again and adding a racial tone. He is hoping he gets more votes from his base than he loses from Core Republicans who decide Trump is bad for their portfolios.Thanks for the A2A Gregory Rush",25,0.026675485008818358,0.4678571428571428,0.5945750379422605
973,"China’s Shift Away From Exports Provides Cushion Against Tariffs :“BEIJING—China is preparing for a trade war with the U.S. that could disrupt President Xi Jinping’s development agenda, though the country’s economy is better positioned to weather short-term shocks than just a few years ago.As China shifts away from exports in favor of domestic consumption, it has a better cushion against external jolts. Several economists estimated that the Trump administration’s plan to slap tariffs on as much as $60 billion of Chinese products would trim China’s economic growth rate—targeted at about 6.5% this year—by 0.1 percentage point if put into effect.“Today, when faced with a new trade war imposed on us, the difference in economic strength between China and the U.S. has never been more favorable to China,” said Mei Xinyu, an analyst at a think tank under China’s Commerce Ministry. (…)”“(…) Chinese officials have suggested specifically targeting industries in areas of the U.S. with large percentages of Trump supporters, such as the Farm Belt, according to people familiar with the discussions.Mr. Mei, the researcher affiliated with the Commerce Ministry, said that as the largest foreign holder of U.S. debt, China can also retaliate by selling its holdings of U.S. Treasurys. Holding the world’s largest foreign-exchange reserves and relatively low levels of national government debt also give Beijing room to maneuver.“China has more to lose in the long run, but it’s much better positioned to mitigate short-term damage because the government will simply step in to subsidize affected industries and keep injured companies afloat,” said Leland Miller, CEO of China Beige Book International, an advisory firm that tracks the Chinese economy.Still, some economists warn that if trade war escalates, it could cause long-term pain to the Chinese economy. Lower costs still give China’s exporters a competitive advantage, which means that increased tariffs will make China-made goods less attractive to U.S. consumers, said Yang Weixiao, an economist at Founder Securities.

988,"The losers in this action by Trump will be the industries that depend on steel and aluminum which will face higher prices. That means some of the nation’s largest industries: automobile, aircraft, heavy machinery and heavy equipment manufacturing industries. These manufacturers that use steel and aluminum for their products are significantly larger than are steel and aluminum producers. Statistically, steel imports are only about one-third of what US industry needs and so, the tariff would not apply to domestic steel production. Aluminum is a different matter for only 10 percent is produced domestically.WTO RULESThe World Trade Organization (WTO) agreement states that countries are free to take actions they consider critical to their security interests. However, WTO members are very cautious about using this provision because of the dire consequences to trade and the implications it can provoke. It follows that China, India, Brazil and other countries are just as capable of making such fake claims based on similar national security rationales for restricting imports. The provision of law that Trump is relying on for the imposition of this new tariffs is “Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 which allows imports to be blocked on national security grounds. “Previous administrations had interpreted the provision narrowly, requiring evidence that the military needs or strategic industries could not be supplied by U.S. production. The US Commerce Department under Trump is disregarding a half century of precedent by finding that steel imports coming from the most-trusted U.S. allies, such as Canada and the EU need be taxed. The risk assessment of Trump’s action is hard to quantify for the affected countries can easily retaliate by imposing tariffs on American goods. Moreover, tariffs could be imposed on targeted goods in order to cause economic and political sting. American exporters of all economic sectors should be weary of steps that might follow whether they are exporters of agricultural products or aerospace vehicles for once wars is started it is impossible to predict how it will end as history indicates from the 1930′s world economy experience. The invocation of national security concerns by Trump could be used as a precedent in which other nations might be willing to use national security as grounds for tariffs, and thus, neutralizing the ability of the World Trade Organization to arbitrate disputes. Whether a hot war or a trade war neither case is as easy as Trump claims it to be for our historical record indicates that wars in general have been started by either madness or stupidity.In “The Art of War,” Sun Tzu states that ""Every battle is won or lost before it's ever fought"". Détente was used during the cold war for easing strained relations, especially, in using the threat of a pre-empty attack. Today, a battle space has many dimensions which now include cyberspace. The defensive plan may not survive first contact with an adversary, but the general staff will quickly formulates a new plan and adapt making the evolving plan a part of the plan as the pieces move before the actual battle begins. In this scenario, it would be foolish to predict the outcome of a battle where the enemy is fully committed to fight back in any way they can and with whatever resources they muster together. China today is not an underdog to be bullied.A report last week states that China’s government is contemplating reducing its purchases of U.S. treasury bonds and briefly rattled financial markets. Against the tensions between the two countries, it was widely understood as a warning that aggressive American action on trade might jeopardize the willingness of China to subsidize the drunken spending of the U.S. government.China is now, and has been for a decade, the largest foreign buyer of U.S. treasury debt, with Japan being a close second. The Chinese central bank has halted new purchases and sold old holdings, each time the Trump administration rattles noise about China, which triggers concerns in U.S. economicChina’s foreign currency reserves now stand at more than $3 trillion. In contrast, the U.S. has foreign exchange reserves that hover at around $120 billion. Trump’s tariffs would automatically trigger penalties against the U.S. in the World Trade Organization (WTO), and might even lead to serious disruption of WTO’s years of negotiating or total collapse, which would inevitably lead to higher world tariffs against U.S. exports. Even if it doesn’t take place immediately the sense of turmoil to come would be enough to trigger dire uncertainty for American business and employment. China, on the other hand with a centralized party government system has a better probability of surviving the hard blow of global trade disruptions.“The only way to deal with a trade deficit is raise savings and investment rates,” Lardy said recently, referring to the reason deficits occur. In other words, Americans are consuming and spending more than they produce.” Lardy continues “It’s a strategy that’s almost certain to fail, that’s because U.S. trade deficits are largely the result of the shortfall in national savings relative to investments — a long-running imbalance that isn’t likely to change any time soon. Everything is working against Trump’s announced objective.”Trump Tax Cuts are a Walk on the BrinkCan America under Trump win a trade war with China? One option to be considered might have a nuclear effect on world economy and that is— China’s dumping US debt and replacing its dollars holdings with another reserve currency. By planning to add to the bulging US debt newly printed $2 trillion dollars, the GOP is putting the US at the mercy of its debtors mainly China and Japan.

993,"Two things come to mind: broad trade agreements like NAFTA are in danger because Trump is headed for bi-lateral agreements. The second is, he is targeting specific countries which is discriminatory against specific countries, in this case China. China knows and America knows that trade should only be charged against ‘value added’ for products exported, ie if a product uses imported parts from other countries in a ‘free trade zone’, they should be valued at the ‘value added’ cost, not the retail price. On average, it is estimated that 50% of the export value from China is the China ‘value added’ so China’s exports to the US are really only half the stated trade export value to the US. From the US to China, grains, aircraft, and machinery are almost 100% American made with American parts and labor Both the WTO and Americans know this defect and it is not widely advertised. China has complained to the WTO and nothing is being done. Trump is gaming the system and he will find, to his dismay, that China will obviously retaliate. If China adds tariffs to American grain and aircraft, Countries like Brazil, Argentina, Canada, and Australia will gain business from China. Airbus will benefit if Boeing is slapped with a Chinese tariff. So what is gained? Nothing. Trump wants $60 billion in reduced trade from China. He will get it with his ‘country specific’ attack. China will retaliate with like kind tariffs. It’s like playing chicken and to see who blinks first. Loss of jobs in farming and aircraft will get a loud cry from his constituents, especially from his core support in the mid-West. Stupid in gets stupid out.“The U.S. trade deficit with China was $375 billion in 2017. The trade deficit exists because U.S. exports to China were only $130 billion while imports from China were $506 billion. The United States imports consumer electronics, clothing and machinery from China. A lot of the imports are from U.S. manufacturers that send raw materials to China for low-cost assembly. Once shipped back to the United States, they are considered imports.” The Real Reason American Jobs Are Going to ChinaSo, if China’s exports at ‘value added’ were considered, China’s export to the US would be 50% of $506 billion, or $253 billion. US exports at $130 billion would make the deficit $123 billion instead of $375 billion, about one third of what is computed now. BTW, there are things China wants to buy from the US but the US restricts these items from China. China buys from Europe, Japan, South Korea, and Israel to replace these items.“The bilateral trade number fails to fully explain the impact of trade with China on the US economy. As it plugs into the global industrial supply chain, China is the “Great Assembler.” The OECD estimates that about one-third of the content of Chinese exports is foreign, compared with just 15 percent of US exports. Although China has been trying to increase its domestic consumption and move up the value-added chain, the latest data suggests that even in key growth markets—computer equipment, electronics, and electrical machinery—the foreign content of goods assembled and re-exported from China is still roughly 50 percent.” The US-China Bilateral Trade Balance in Value Added“The shipment of the ready-to-use iPhones from China to the US is recorded as China’s exports to the US. Using the total manufacturing cost $178.96 as the price of the iPhone, China’s iPhone exports to the US amounted $2.0 billion in 2009. Assuming that the parts supplied by Broadcom, Numonyx and Cirrus Logic, valued at $121.5 million, were imported from the US the iPhone alone contributed $1.9 billion trade deficit to the US, about 0.8% of the US trade deficit with China………If China’s iPhone exports were calculated based on the value added, i.e., the assembling cost, the export value as well as the trade deficit in the iPhone would be much smaller, at only $73 million, just 3.6% of the $2.0 billion calculated with the prevailing method (Table 2). The sharp contrast of the two different measurements indicates that conventional trade statistics are inconsistent with trade where global production networks and production fragmentation determine cross-country flows of parts, components, and final products. The traditional method of recording trade has failed to reflect the actual value chain distribution and painted a distorted picture about the bilateral trade relations. The Sino-US bilateral trade imbalance has been greatly inflated.” How the iPhone widens the US trade deficit with ChinaIf Trump gets Apple to move assembly of iPhones to the US, can the US assemble and test the iPhone for approximately $6? I doubt it. So, either way the consumer will be charged more for a product that is already expensive where Apple makes a 40% profit.What’s the bottom line? This could be the start of a worldwide trade war. Trade is like the blood vessels in the human body, disrupt the flow and parts of the body could die. Our organs are like nations, they are dependent more on trade than ever. Some do better than others and that should give cause to those that are behind to improve their export values so they are competitive. Today, the US is strong in technology, yet Trump cuts the budget for research, puts up protectionist barriers, scaring H1-B visa holders to take flight to Canada, and in all probabliity the number of foreign students seeking to study in the US will diminish and those that do study here, will go back home instead of seeking to stay.

And in 1991 the BoJ became independent, and adopted the whole kit and caboodle of Washington Consensus macroeconomics, and the Japanese lost generations of low economic growth began.The Chinese leadership are, in my considered opinion, very unlikely to abandon the Shimomuran practices which have produced and which continue to produce growth rates about three times that of the USA.Monetarism/Washington Consensus Macroeconomics/Neoliberalism /Austerity is the recipe for reducing economic growth rates, the impoverishment of the working class and a long period of economic doldrums.

Years of over development of infrastructure and misallocating infrastructure have built up massive debts that local governments and SOE's are largely rolling over to newer loans. The problem is many of these companies are not very profitable. And now with the Central bank rising interest rates and removing excess liquidity the businesses are stuck between paying their debts and trying to compete with inefficient, outdated, and outclassed companies.China is turning away from being the workshop of the world. China is trying to become a consumer led/driven economy. As the SOE's are struggling to compete the Central government has also become increasingly less interested in the industries they serve. Unfortunately the consumer class that has developed has also picked up the bad habit of excess credit growth. The Chinese miracle of consumer growth has led to the household debt to GDP to nearly mirror and likely to surpass American consumer debt levels soon if the pace of growth continues. The financial health of US consumers has been questioned at best. If Chinese consumers continue on the path of debt growth the health of this portion of the economy will continue to be questioned.",1,0.010550082101806241,0.41449096880131364,0.9216973913915734

It’s essential that he continues to speed it up.He’ll double China’s GDP by 2020 yet he’s been decreasing China’s GINI since he was elected in 2012.Facundo Alvaredo, Lucas Chancel, Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman–the world's leading authorities on income inequality–studied Global Inequality Dynamics: New Findings in 2017. (You can download a copy here). Here’s what they found:Inequality in both the U.S. and China has grown rapidly over the past few decades (Deng warned the Chinese it would but nobody warned Americans–so Americans are upset and the Chinese are just patient).In 1978, the bottom 50% of Chinese income-earners (people earning under $9,280, using PPP exchange rates) got 27 percent of the nation’s income. By 2015 their share had fallen to 15 percent.During that 1978–2015 interval, the bottom 50% of Americans ( with annual incomes below $36,000) saw a ‘complete collapse’ in their share: from 20 percent to 12 percent—3 points below China's. Look at the results:The researchers’ recommendations? “Policy discussions about rising global inequality should focus on how to equalize the distribution of primary assets including better education, access to skills and minimum wage reform”. China has been laser-focused on distribution of primary assets including better education, access to skills and minimum wage reform since President Xi’s election in 2012. That’s why urban poverty was eliminated in 2012 and rural poverty will be vanish in 2020.GINI doesn’t measure wealth (assets like home ownership, stocks and bonds) but, if it did, the picture would look very different because the poorest Chinese are the wealthiest poor people in the world: almost all own their own homes, mortgage-free.And here’s a final piece of good news: President Xi just announced that the entire country will focus on GINI improvement between 2020 and 2035: 400 million people will be brought into the cash economy. China’s GINI has been improving since 2012 and the economy has not slowed down.

1010,"The question is so hypothetical that it can’t be answered. To even start an answer, you would have to lay a lot more groundwork.First, why would third world (or even second-world) countries be trying to punish China? If it is for unfair competition, remember that there are plenty of countries that are trying to compete with China using tactics that are just as unfair (or even more). If North Korea, for example, were to try to punish China, they would destroy their own economy in a matter of days.China has plenty of domestic demand, and could easily out-last countries such as India, Pakistan, and so on. Low-cost competitors such as Honduras might be helped, but the net drop-off in demand from those countries would be minimal.So let’s say that you are mainly talking about Western consumer countries, like the U.S., Britain, France, and Germany.China’s exports in any given year are about $2 trillion. Their imports average about $1.5 trillion. So China’s total trade surplus in any given year is about $500 billion dollars. If the exports were to suddenly stop, there is little doubt that China would respond by shutting off the imports as well.The sudden loss of exports would definitely hurt the economy of China, since it is most likely about 20% of their GDP (exact numbers are not known, so it might be less, but is not more). China could certainly absorb some of that by switching much of their manufacturing might to items that they typically import, but much of their imports are services, financial products, and food, so the net hit to their economy would still be huge.I would say that China would suffer a recession, but they would be able to ride it out.The net hit to the rest of the world would be harder to define. About $300 billion of that trade imbalance is just the United States. For many of these products, there are other suppliers, but their costs are much higher.Computer parts, for example, are made in China at costs the rest of the world can’t even come close to. So we would most likely see an immediate price jump of 45% to 55% of every electronic component of everything. since electronics is pervasive in every industry, this might flow through to a 15% inflation rate in the first year.In the United States, employees usually only receive raises once per year, this would be like getting a 15% cut in pay. In the first year, 15% of everyone’s retirement savings would be gone. Nationwide strikes would be only months away.Although many new businesses would spring up to supply products formerly made in China, their costs would be high, their profit margins low, and their employees would be underpaid, by definition.Many farmers would go out of business without their huge international customers. The crop surpluses in the U.S. would drive crop prices so low that it would cost as much to harvest wheat and soybeans as you could sell them for.Many business would go under, simply because they could no longer afford to make ends meet without a steady supply of low-cost product.The recession in the United States would make the Great Depression seem mild by comparison. I am guessing that the worldwide financial system would be destroyed, unemployment would top 50%, and that something like 10% of the population would starve to death before alternate arrangements for food, shelter, and clothing could be made.",4,0.11211552571722064,0.4215782522562182,0.8046999722430919

So they are most likely going to continue to apply pressure and try to force China to change through non military actions. They have been attempting to make China “compromise” for a while; compromise for America means do what we want for nothing in return.They are attempting to do things but it is difficult due to the size of the Chinese economy and the relationships China has cultivated while America has isolated many countries. There was an attempt to resist permitting the yuan from becoming a global reserve currency. The USA attempted to pressure China into changing how it regulated its exchange rates and how open its economy is.China responded by creating its own version of the swift system so that USA would be limited in their ability to sanction or wage economic war against China. China was able to get many EU countries to join the new system as well as the BRICS nations and many other countries. The compromise that was reached was to let China into the global system that already existed without needing to make many changes. China in turn stopped pushing their new version of swift.America also attempted to intervene in the disputes over the South China Sea (the source of most trade in the region) by getting the Philippians to take the matter to court. China in turn got the Philippians to become closer to China and further from USA. USA got the court ruling they wanted but are unable to inforce it (mainly due to their unwillingness to sign the law they are attempting to make China follow).America has now turned to pressuring China into a more “fair” trade arrangement. They have also prevented China from acquiring certain types of technology manufacturers and have intervened in Chinese purchases of companies in USA (and Europe).This may not seem like use of military force, aside from the actions in the South China Sea where navy ships are being use to display strength in a hope of reassuring countries like the Philippians that they will be protected, but it is all only possible due to America’s military.In the end China will most likely not change. We are where we were prior to the conflicts of the 1800s, except China is now wiser and has a much better military and technology. It will take time for USA to realize that it’s no longer a one man show, but they will most likely adjust rather then go to war.The swap agreements and pricing of oil for gold are examples of actions that usually lead to direct war with USA. China has done these things with no direct consequences. They have been moving towards the removal of the US currency for trade. This would lead to independence from America and make it difficult for America to apply as much pressure, and will most likely lead to a more equitable relationship.IMO Americans should enjoy the trade deficit while they can. Before long China may ask (agree) to balancing trade by buying gold from USA for the dollars they no longer need for international trade.

1035,"China already is a super power.If you look at what a super power is supposed to be, China fits the mold.Economic strength; China has the highest GDP ppp,(purchasing power parity) and that is what counts when you rate a country’s economy.NGDP, (nominal gross domestic product) is simply a number that accounts for goods and services provided by a country, it does not say how much can be bought for the money generated.China ranks highest in GDP ppp above the EU in second place and the US in third. You can get more value for your money in China than in the EU or the US.Manufacturing ability; No question about that one. China is a manufacturing dynamo. There is no country on earth can match its ability to produce products or get things done faster. While other countries are wondering what to do and how to do it, China has it done. China has more high speed rail systems built and running than the rest of the world combined. China has used more cement for building structures in 3 years 2011–2012–2013 than the US has used in all of the 20th century.Social change and infrastructure: A super power must have a healthy population. It can not claim to be a super power if its population is starving. homeless and left to remain so. China has moved more than 500 million people out of poverty. It has build and rebuilt old housing and infrastructure to service a billion people. It still has people who need to be brought out of poverty but its poverty rate is less than the US while it has 4 times the population.A harmonious Foreign Policy; China has spread more peace around the world with mutually beneficial trade deals and the necessary infrastructure to increase that trade as well as open doors for people in the countries it has affected than any other country has in the last 100 years. They have not dropped one bomb or fired one bullet or created one refugee or displaced one person in its rise to a world power and its development of trade routes. At the moment someone in England can put a parcel on a train in London and have it arrive in Bejing 15 days later across the rail lines of China’s old silk road trade route to Europe. A huge saving in time and money compared to the sea routes. The amount of freight already transported to western Europe is enormous, something more than 4000 train loads of containers full of goods since about 2015.Government: China has an intelligently organized and run government that seems to be more interested in the people a good government should serve, than filling their pockets. While the west still criticizes the Chinese government for being Communist, they don’t see that the communist party is not the only party in play with influence. There are more than 2900 members of the legislative body and more than 2200 members of the advisory body. That appears on the surface to be far more democratic than a two party system people vote for to get dumb or dumber as a leader controlled by the elite.Military and allies: This is an area where China is not as powerful as the US but still powerful enough to give anyone foolish enough to have a go at her major damage making the prospect very disenchanting. China does not have plans to invade countries near or far. It has a difference of opinion with India but at the same time they cooperate at most levels so unless someone sends a Victoria Neuland in to destabilize things, that should not be a problem. If China has to use its military it will be to defend its home turf and there is no army on earth capable of taking China from 1.3 billion pissed off Chinese men and women.So, I would say China is already a super power in its own right, and better than any others in many areas.",7,0.20247209821428572,0.4492113095238095,0.8601724572244939

1044,"If the Trump administration administered tariffs on imported Chinese products, how much would the Chinese economy slow down?A2A.It depends on the specifics of the tariff regime, but generally-speaking, not as much as the US will suffer. For three reasons.One, given how much consumer products are from China, a tariff on Chinese product is a tax on consumer products. So average consumers will experience a Sticker Shock, which translates to a crash of Consumer confidence. The money you put aside for the big pre-school purchases for book bags, stationery, new clothes, suddenly doesn’t go as far as it needs to be anymore! Fall in Consumer Confidence leads to Fall in Aggregate Demand, and we all know where that can lead to - recession, here we come!Two, given how much China supplies parts for US Exports, a tariff on Chinese product is a tariff on US Exports. So the US Exports will become less competitive globally. So you can see President Trump’s tariff proposal as a proposal of the US to China, “Let me have more of the US domestic market. In exchange, you can have the rest of the world.” Well, given the size of the US economy vs. the rest of the world, it’s debatable if this is a good trade.Lastly, in the global trade eco-system, China is the lowest-cost producer. It buys resources from all over the world, uses them to make household products, and sells these products back to the rest of the world. So as soon as the US puts in a tariff, which results a reduction of downstream demands, China will cut its upstream import of resources. So all these resource-producing countries got hit. Hard. From Australia to Chile to Saudi Arabia to the African countries. There simply won’t be as much demand for resources as before.So then what happens? Well, these countries become poorer, and they can’t afford the high-priced manufacturers, like the US and EU, anymore. So they’ll buy more from China and less from the US and EU! Talking about shooting oneself on the foot. Karma, anybody?What’s happening in the US right now, is that people are slowly finding out that neither the Left, nor the Right, is effective against the Stupid.",356,0.05806441033713761,0.29873081463990564,0.9508269002044505
1045,"Not much. I am mostly referring to the steel and aluminum imports President Trump has already announced.1) Most US steel comes from Canada. China represents a small portion of the US import market.2) Assuming Trump is serious, China would keep exporting steel -- to Europe. President Trump just made US cars more expensive and less attractive to buyers. Expect the US to make and sell fewer cars -- even to domestic buyers. Instead, China will ship more steel ingots to Germany which will ship more finished cars around the world.3) I would not worry, however. Most of President Trump's protectionism can be termed Fake News. The President is happy to make sound bites for his bas, but quietly backs down before he angers Wall Street too much. President Trump has already announced so many exemptions to his tariffs that most observers believe there will be no real effect. The stock markets have pretty much discounted the possibility that any trade sanctions will have any real affect.

1046,"I think we can look at a previous instance where American demand for Chinese exports decreased sharply. Chinese GDP growth went from 14.7% in 2007 to 9.7 in 2008 and 9.4% in 2009. This is roughly a 5% decrease in annual GDP growth. However, in 2007 exports were 35% of Chinese GDP whereas they are now 18%, so we should expect a reduction in external trade to have roughly half the effect on Chinese GDP growth as back in 2007.The US currently makes up around 18.3% of total Chinese exports. If the US imposes tariffs on Chinese exports to cause reduction in demand equivalent to the GFC, we should expect (18/35) x 18.3% x (14.7% - 9.7%) = 0.47% reduction in annual GDP growth.China’s current rate of GDP growth is 6.5–6.7%/year. So in order to slow down Chinese GDP growth by 0.5%/year to 6%/year, Trump would have to enact tariffs that have the same effect on American consumption as the Financial Crisis. (Trump’s currently threatened tariffs would not achieve nearly this much, it will likely be a rounding error)The question is, are the American people willing to endure a decline in standard of living equivalent to another GFC to slow down Chinese GDP growth by 0.5%/year?",29,-0.037326388888888895,0.22925347222222225,0.6070204891025927

In areas like shoes (a top-5 import from China to the US) there is not a current alternative supplier in the US of any scale. If the tariffs were exclusive to China, allowing, say, Vietnamese trainers in, Chinese trainers would simply be trans-shipped via a third country as tyres were to Indonesia (then the US) when Obama slapped a tariff on Chinese tyres.The main Chinese exports to the US are smallish goods - Christmas tree lights, baseball caps, etc. It is difficult to write clear tariffs for these and mostly there is more-or-less no indigenous US industry to take up the slack, so little change except a tax on US consumers - and Wallmart.You will not build up a domestic industry, as few would invest in, say, a US trainer factory that would go bust the minute tariffs are revoked.",23,0.0222953216374269,0.31908939014202164,0.9888990071734025
1048,"The cost to China is huge, hence why the Chinese are doing there best to prevent Trump from doing it. If it hurt the US economy more then China, why is China so worried. Reality is when you don't listen to vested interests promoting articles on how it will hurt the US more then China is simply false.While US consumers may pay more for products, it could not come at a better time when the US economy is at full employment, growth is solid. A trade war may make the Federal Reserve hold fire on a few rate rises as inflation will take care of itself with price rises. In the short and medium term some pain in the economy will be felt but over time as new products are produced locally to replace those imported from China will provided increased stimulus to the economy.Free trade has mostly benefited the wealthy the past 30 years as cheap products made in China inflated profits and share prices but resulted in lower wage increases and lost employment across the US. To have solid wage rises you need some inflation, you need products made in the US to be sold at reasonable prices. Consumers must pay a price that enables products to be produced in the US to support US jobs. No one is talking about complete trade embargoes, the US will still source a lot of its products overseas but a rebalancing is required as China for too long has manipulated trade to its advantage, cant blame them for that but time to tighten the purse strings.China on the other hand cant instantly find another 300 million consumers as wealth as the US market. The tens of thousands of factories which employ tens of millions of Chinese to produce products for US consumers will have no one to sell too. These products will be dumbed in markets overseas for a fraction of the price they could have sold for in the US resulting in massive losses to Chinese businesses and likely thousands of factories closing or going bankrupt over time. This is if the US imposes broad range tariffs on many Chinese imports which seems to be Trumps next move.China losses massive amounts of export revenue, millions of jobs. I also sense a strategy from the US to test the strength of the Chinese economy built on a mountain of debt. China is the largest competitor for the US and a rising challenge, why would the US want to continue allowing China to trade at such unfair advantage to the USA. It doesn't make sense, it makes sense the US would now try and apply pressure and see if the Chinese economy starts to sink under its own weight once a few economic torpedoes are put into it side. A Chinese recession would test the strength of the Chinese Government and the support of the people, slow military spending and its programs for overseas.If I was the US president now, its exactly what I would want to do. Test the mettle of the Chinese economy in a true economic crisis. Don't allow the Chinese free trade with the US market until China opens up completely to US corporations. This is why Trump is talking about reciprocal trade and taxes. If countries impose taxes on US exports those same level of taxes will be applied to there exports to the USA, is that not fair.China is the biggest threat to the USA, so why would the US continue to give China an advantage in trade. Its long overdue that the US took China to task over its trade and economic policies. For China is may be coming at a vulnerable moment when its mountain of debt is built on shaky foundations and talk is once against spreading about a looming Chinese financial crisis. Will Trumps tariffs actually bring this about if they really hurt the Chinese economy. Perhaps that is Trumps goal to push China off an economic cliff.You can bet if Trump places large tariffs then the EU will likely follow otherwise Chinese products will be dumped there. Between these two market they account for nearly $1 trillion in exports for China.

Vehicular pollution here is extremely low. Motorcycles are simply not found. Neither are scooters running on petrol. Instead, the streets and sidewalks are flooded with electric scooters that people charge in their shops or at home!3) The government has already shut down many of the factories in the north and has given large incentives to home and agro based industries from the rural hinterland. Every week, I end up seeing massive exhibitions in Tianjin, Shenzhen, Chengdu with exhibitors from hinterland selling ecofriendly produce.4) Most of the tricycles (commonly used for the delivery of products purchased online) in cities are already electric, thus further lowering emissions.5) Data on monitoring the PM levels all over China is freely available to all Chinese people. And seeing the orange levels tells me that this is not doctored. I found subsequently that the air that my countryfolk have to breath back in India in Mumbai and Delhi is normally 4 ties as bad as Northern China!6) Every second day, for the past two years, people from the government (including the top bosses) keep reminding us how much more needs to be done to reduce pollution in the country. Thus the western media and NGOs - mostly based in EU and USA/Canada (who, let us admit, only arouse rabble but don't stay on to improve matters on the ground) are really not needed.The country needs to develop for 1.3 billion people, without damaging the environment the way Europe and USA did for smaller populations. Thus the solution will also have to be from here, certainly not a failed one from the west. I think the government is doing a good job there (far better than my won country where the Ganges and Yamuna continue to remain dirty and polluted, and where our cities and towns continue to be highly polluted, as all doctors who live there will testify)Disclaimer: I have written what I have actually seen on the ground and not what is said by some government spokesperson, some ngo or in the news - Chinese or western.",22,0.0917576272933416,0.41603458049886627,0.8972080145922515
1065,"Well definitely it is a yes to this question. The population died due to severe air pollution in China every year is around 500 thousand. This is a stat provided by government officials, so very probably the figure is in fact underestimated. Number of deaths caused by lung cancer have risen for 465% in past 30 years. According to a research done in 2014, among 161 cities only 16 could meet the required level of air condition, and the current situation could be even worse. In 2015 December the Beijing local goverment issued the first red sign, indicating that the air is extremely heavily polluted. All secondary schools, primary schools, and kindergartens has to be closed for three days to wait for the air condition to improve. China has become the largest carbon emitting country since 2014, mainly due to its large consumption of fossil fuels like coal. In 2015, Xi Jinping stated in a poverty reduction and development forum that the target for the next five years is to help the existing approximately 70 million rural poor out of poverty. In many of these poorest regions in China, people still face various difficulties in obtaining basic necessities, including drinking water, electricity, transportation, education and medical services. These poor regions tend to be environmentally fragile areas. The unreasonable development and exploitation of these places can easily lead to a worsening of their environmental conditions. The large middle class population in China is also another root of the current environmental problems. Many observers have already warned China of the possible environmental impact of the consumption habits and lifestyles of the large middle class. Although economic development in China in the last 30 years has created huge wealth and allowed hundreds of millions of people to escape from poverty, increasing industrial production has led to serious water and land pollution in China. The relatively wealthy population living in the eastern part of China is also facing serious environmental challenges from air, water and land pollution.China definitely has to start doing something to help relieve the problems, at least bring a halt to the continuously worsening trend. And the Chinese government did seems to be aware of this point and has begun to discuss ways in handling this issue. With energy conservation and environmental protection sweeping the world, “high efficiency” and “clean energy” became an important part of the 12th FYP. The State Council, collaborating with the National Development and Reform Commission, and relevant departments developed the “Twelfth Five Year Energy Development Plan”. The plan set out broader and longer targets for energy saving, environmental protection, clean energy, development of wind power, photovoltaics, biomass and nuclear energy, and covering different areas like electricity, coal, oil, natural gas and new energy.

1070,"From http://economictimes.coThousands of acres of agricultural land will be leased out to Chinese enterprises in Pakistan to set up projects” in areas ranging from seed varieties to irrigaNEW DELHI: The China-Pakistan-Economic-Corridor (CPEC) -- flagship project under the mega One Belt One Road (OBOR) initiative -- is not merely a corridor that Pakistan is hoping will transform its economy but rather a project that may wreck its finances and societal structure.A 15-year master plan of CPEC that has come to light reveals that Pakistan will be fully subjugated by China under the current terms and conditions of the project.The master plan, a copy of which is seen by ET, envisages a deep and broad-based penetration of most sectors of Pakistan’s economy as well as its society by Chinese enterprises and culture. The plan spells out in detail what Chinese intentions and priorities are in Pakistan for the next 15 years. It may be recalled that China has decided to invest $62 billion for the CPEC project.Under the plan, thousands of acres of agricultural land will be leased out to Chinese enterprises in Pakistan to set up “demonstration projects” in areas ranging from seed varieties to irrigation technology.A system of monitoring and surveillance will be built in cities from Peshawar to Karachi with 24-hour video recording on roads and busy marketplaces for law and order.Besides, as the per master plan, a national fibre-optic backbone will be built for Pakistan not only for internet traffic, but also terrestrial distribution of broadcast TV, which will cooperate with Chinese media in the “dissemination of Chinese culture”. A similar Sinification is visible in the Mandalay town of Myanmar which has impacted local architecture and culture. It remains to be seen how a conservative section of the Pakistani society reacts to the influence of Chinese culture.In some areas, the plan is to build on a market presence already established by Chinese enterprises -- for instance, Haier in household appliances, China Mobile and Huawei in telecommunications, and China Metallurgical Group Corporation in mining and minerals.A key thrust of the plan lies in agriculture. Pakistan will also become a market for agricultural produce from Western China and this will adversely impact local producers, alleged Pakistani civil society activists. From provision of seeds and other inputs, such as fertiliser, credit and pesticides, Chinese enterprises will also operate their own farms, processing facilities for fruits and vegetables and grain. Logistics companies will operate a large storage and transportation system for agrarian produce, as per the CPEC master plan. Chinese enterprises will take the lead in each field.Experts on Chinese economy claim that Beijing’s goal through CPEC is to improve the agriculture sector of certain western provinces. The plan proposes to harness the work of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps to bring mechanization as well as scientific technique in livestock breeding, development of hybrid varieties and precision irrigation to Pakistan. It sees its main opportunity as helping the Kashgar Prefecture, a territory within the larger Xinjiang Autonomous Zone, which is poverty ridden.FIBRE OPTIC WORRIESOne of the oldest priorities for the Chinese government since talks on CPEC began is fibre optic connectivity between China and Pakistan. An MoU for such a link was signed in July 2013 which may impact India’s security. “Moreover, China’s telecom services to Africa need to be transferred in Europe, so there’s a certain hidden danger of the overall security,” says the plan.The plan also envisages a terrestrial cable across the Khunjerab pass to Islamabad, and a submarine landing station of cable in Gwadar. Gwadar, as per the plan, “is positioned as the direct hinterland connecting Balochistan and Afghanistan”.The expanded bandwidth will enable terrestrial broadcast of digital HD television, called Digital Television Terrestrial Multimedia Broadcasting (DTMB). This is envisioned as more than just a technological contribution. According to the master plan, “It is a cultural transmission carrier. The future cooperation between Chinese and Pakistani media will be beneficial to disseminating Chinese culture in Pakistan, further enhancing mutual understanding between the two peoples and the traditional friendship between the two countries.”“There is a plan to build a pilot safe city in Peshawar, which faces a fairly severe security situation in northwestern Pakistan,” the plan says, following which the initiative will be extended to major cities such as Islamabad, Lahore and Karachi. This may see deployment of Chinese forces in Pakistan with a direct bearing on Indian security.Importantly, Pakistan’s federal and involved local governments should also bear part of the responsibility for financing through issuing sovereign guarantee, according to the plan.",1,0.07754683840749414,0.2752146760343482,0.979369588278631

1075,"This is interesting question..There are three phase of Chinese economy post WW2 that is influenced by three different Chinese leaders.MaoismDeng XiaopingXi JinpingChinese destitution should be explored from the Opium Wars.“Through most of Chinese history, China’s main threat came from nomadic horse-riding tribes along its long northern border. Even in the Cold War, hostility with the Soviet Union made its Mongolian border a security hot spot. But the Opium Wars — and even worse, the Japanese invasion in 1937 — demonstrated how China was vulnerable to naval power along its Pacific coast.”The Opium Wars: The Bloody Conflicts That Destroyed Imperial ChinaMao was  Han-racist, Mongolian  breed turned down the fate of China internally through his cultural policy.  After the Japanese colony, China was taken over by Mongolian through Mao and Mao changed the complete polity and its structure through coercion. Under “Great Leap Forward” policy, Mao, not only destroyed indigenous economy, but converted the China as “Commune” through ‘’one-party system’, where people of China had no alternative / option.What was Commune policy?“Communes, the largest collective units, were divided in turn into production brigades and production teams. The communes had governmental, political, and economic functions.”“In the commune, everything was shared. Private kitchens became redundant, and everything in the private kitchen, such as tables, chairs, cooking utensils and pans were all contributed to the commune's kitchen. Private cooking was banned and replaced by communal dining.”People's commune - WikipediaMao’s contribution to China was actually to destroy the Chinese civilisation, i.e. its indigenous economy, craftsmanship and most important, its ‘sociology’.  From the family unit, Chinese became community.  When the sociology of any region/civilisation is destroyed, then it is actually ‘breaking of spine’ and this is what Mao did to China. It is sociology that defines people and responsible of its evolution.The tenure of Hua Guofeng, brought a change and correction in the Mao’s policy.“Deng Xiaoping did not originate reform and opening — that began under the leadership of Hua Guofeng after the death of Mao Zedong in 1976.”China under Deng Xiaoping’s leadership“In December 1978, a group of party veterans led by Deng Xiaoping, a pragmatic reformer, forced Hua from power but allowed him to retain some titles. Hua gradually faded into political obscurity, but continued to insist on the correctness of Maoist principles.”Hua Guofeng - WikipediaWhy  Hua Guofeng was removed even though he placed China into reformed position? Becoz Hua Guofeng was not the hand-tool of Rothschild whereas Deng Xiaoping was.  The economy reform under the tag of Deng Xiaoping was the wealth management of Rothschild scheme.  The change of foreign policy of China under Deng Xiaoping was due to the outcome Vietnam War, and China changed its policy on Japan and intruded it films, television series and literature to change its mood towards Japan.  All the ports and market was surrendered to the international investors.  This was more critical that what China was after Opium Wars.  Deng Xiaoping revived China’s ‘Opium War’ history.“Lacking a unifying figure like Deng or Mao, China’s leadership today is a mostly faceless group of long time party engineers who have scaled the ranks not by fighting in wars or developing political and economic ideologies but rather by cultivating higher-ranking bureaucrats and divulging as little as possible about their ideas and plans.”After Deng: On China's TransformationWhat was this ‘faceless groups’?  They were Crime Mafia, Mafia of drugs, sex and weapon/violence.  These ‘faceless groups’ were moderated by Military.  Military became the oppressors of the ‘civility’ and operator of the Crime Syndicate.  The financial flow that is strengthening Chinese economy is nothing but the capital earned from DRUGS/CRIME. That is the reason, Chinese products are underrated and captured the market of periphery countries and periphery population in the core nations.Xi Jinping leadership has strengthened this syndicate under the tag of BRICS where it has centralised the DRUGS Syndicate and its periphery crime syndicates such has sex slave and violence to generate silk routes to reach out to the people of every continental without the hindrances of Law enforcement of the local agencies.So, what is CHINA’s Financial Market and Economy..  IT IS THE “POLITICS OF DRUGS” generated through “OPIUM WARS”",1,0.018278769841269832,0.33030753968253973,0.9967777844441565

Kissinger is among the most powerful person from the globalist elite group residing mostly in the city of London. He is the masterful thinker, and wanted to solve the severe US budget deficit caused by Vietnam war. He wanted to go off the gold standard to avoid US from selling the 10,000 tons gold holdings in the Treasury, to pay off the huge budget deficit. So he proposed a strategic idea to make US dollar the global reserve currency.To do so, Kissinger need to bring China into the global market fast and become the top three users of US dollars. The other being Japan and Saudi Arab oil producer.Kissinger play a very important role in China becoming global export powerhouse and factory to the world. This is not known by many people.  Kissinger is the kingmaker for the US-China relationship. His key to the success of Petrodollar hegemony created in 1971, is to get China to be the big user of US dollar. This strategy reinforce US dollar as the global reserve currency. US dollar when become the sole global reserve currency, US Congress can print as much billion US dollars they want to finance military spending and social food stamps programs for the over 20 million jobless.China now addicted to US dollars and hold more than 3 trillion US dollar in foreign exchange reserve.Another angle to look into is Kissinger wanted very much for China and US combined forces together during the cold war. Then this allowed globalist elite with US doing the dirty work, to screw the Soviet Union and cause the breakup into Russia.This allow globalist elite from city of London and Wall Street to loot Russia more than 3 trillion dollars of Russia natural resources until Putin put a stop to it.During Gorby and Yelstin leadership when Russia go through transition to market economy, greedy vultures from the city of London, partnered with Russian oligarch to scam trillions of dollar Russia state onwed mineral and oil and gas asset , and transferred to private hands.That is why globalist elite want to get rid of Putin.

He set up the precedent for ambitious party local leaders that in order to preserve your power base you have to play the game well in CPC leadership selection.Hu JT should have told Jiang, we are all in the same boat and should work together to make China a better country with less inflation, less unemployed jobless, clean air, clean water, affordable housing for everyone, allow talented Chinese genius from rural areas to get a stake in China economy and demand all local CPC leaders who engage in political infighting will be terminated from their party membership. But alas he is too greedy to do that.In China communist party system, with undemocratic selection process , leaders are chosen based on connections or guanxi and not meritocracy. Leaders at village, town, city, provincial and state level are selected base on quanxi and political group of secret alliances like in a big mafia system.All these leaders must be member of the Communist Party in order to be qualify and chosen as leader. These leaders will also be assigned to be managers, department head, general manager and director of all the state owned companies and corporations, not based on competency but on guanxi and connections.All the selected leaders face risk of being terminated if something unlucky happen in their department or state owned corporation they are assigned to run. As a results, these leaders will be prone to corruption and trying to make as much money as possible using current system loopholes and enrich themselves. These leaders also fear of losing their communist party membership due to circumstances beyond their control.Being member of the communist party is a privilege and status symbol which carry many advantages in their career. Therefore many young aspiring university graduate are eager to join the China Communist Party once they get job in the state owned companies or government service.The assistant or deputy are chosen by the leaders and most of the time they are less intelligent and less capable than the leaders. Why ? This is because in order to secure your position from being challenge you almost always chose less able future leaders work under you. You would not want a smarter assistant work under you and jump ahead and overtake you in career path. This happen in all institutions, government agencies and state owned corporations throughout China.At the state level, all minister are worry their dirty dealings in the past will be exposed. Therefore to prevent being investigated for corruption and dirty dealings before retire they selected leaders less able than themselves. This method of choosing managers and leaders happen in all stated owned corporations and government departments and agencies.China future leaders will be incompetent fools who are obsessed with status quo and unable to solve the most complex and complicated problems in the changing technology world. This will eventually lead to breakdown of leadership in CPC.When CPC unable to find humble leaders like Eleven, be sure all hell will break loose as happen to Zhao Ziyang and Hu Yaobang when they rumored wanted to grab power from Deng gang.Do you think China leaders from this kind of background have the capabilities and competency to run global corporations and institution in the future and replace US as the global leader ?COPIED FROM JOSHUA WONG FREE HK",0,0.005172296838963509,0.44704246370913037,0.9970120322977714

1117,"Actually two things that are connected. Income inequality and poverty. Though President Xi Jinping has placed poverty as a top priority, as he solve this issue, income inequality becomes the next focus. As other countries have found, the ‘last mile’ in poverty reduction is the hardest. It is much harder and expensive when you seek a lasting solution, not one just cosmetic. Each person, each family that remains in poverty needs a custom solution to fit their needs. Sometimes a local solution can be found like growing a different crop or changing what a village does. But, for some the solution requires moving a family, a village to a distant land where they can begin a new life. With most peoples with poverty as their life, things like housing must be provided by the government, but the attempt is as the saying goes: “give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime” (give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetimeThen comes the focus on income inequality. Though not as extreme as the US, it still is a problem in China. China’s Communist past is steeped with social experiments. From giving land to farmers, giving women an equal voice in the workplace, providing healthcare, providing housing, and even equal pay. Some have worked well, others not so. Deng Xiaoping realized that for China to become a powerhouse, the populace needed private incentives that would propel those who could drive themselves to success. From historic times, this was not the case. What Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin, Hu Jintao, and now Xi Jinping have tried to do is to mature Deng’s guidance into a balanced reform that works for China. China’s governmental strength comes from its ability to plan for the long term. As China gets more prosperous, it still wants it’s citizens to be entrepreneurs, business owners, and skillful workers. China wants it’s young people to seek a good education so they will prove a fertile foundation for China’s growth into technologies and endeavors that will sustain China’s economic and social growth. As this metamorphisis takes place, it seeks a balance for each citizen, not just a minority or oligarchs.

1122,"We need to look at the nature of China’s economic development and its structure today in order to really answer this question.China has a long history of large scale societal upheaval. Regularly through its 4000 year history everything comes crashing down as each attempt at development unravels at the seams.China’s economic model was constructed to solve a problem that has plagued the nation throughout its history. China as a nation has existed for over 4000 years. Most of Chinese history consists of internal struggles between various dynasties fighting to rule over the nation. Maintaining internal cohesion with a large population has been the nation’s great wall that cannot be traversed. Modern China emerged after WW2 when the Japanese who occupied large parts of China were defeated. The resultant vacuum led to civil war between the Chinese nationalists supported by the West and Chinese communists led by Mao Zedong, who was supported by the Soviet Union.Mao and his communists defeated the nationalists and then ruled China with Communism for the next 3 decades. The Communists launched two disastrous strategies to develop China, the first of them – the great leap forward in 1953, attempted to collectivize all aspects of life (even cooking pots), this strategy led to a famine and the death of 30 million people. This disaster of epic proportions gave birth to the reform movement in China which has been central to China’s rapid economic development.The Cultural revolution in in 1966 was even worse.The death of Mao in 1976 led to the emergence of the reformists and chief architect of China’s current economic development - Deng Xiaoping. Under his leadership an analysis of the nation was undertaken by technocrats from the Chinese Communist Party and concluded:its population, and in particular the growth of its population, could become the nation’s Achilles heal. If China’s population growth was not matched with economic growth and employment then the resulting mass unemployment would cause mass poverty, civil unrest and a revolt against the rule of the Communist Party.China created Special Economic Zones (SEZ) in the coastal Guangdong and Fujian provinces, that were designed to attract foreign investment in low-end manufacturing by offering cheap land, labour and a variety of tax and other incentives. This turned China into an export oriented economy and dependent on foreign countries to continue importing from it. The hope was in the future the coastal cities would lead to the development of China’s interior.The value of the Yuan, low wages and cheap exports were all controlled by the communist party to placate the Chinese population. To make Chinese goods more attractive than Japanese and German goods, the Chinese government controlled the value of the exchange rate of its currency with the world, rather than let it float freely.The nation’s large savings were funnelled through banks to firms through subsidized rates. In order to qualify for such loans firms were required to maintain high employment (in order to maintain social cohesion), rates of return on capital, building brands, customer service and profit played no part of this process.China’s growth also came from both huge state investment in infrastructure and heavy industry. 159 large State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), provide the key inputs from utilities, heavy industries and energy resources that facilitate the private sector.So what are Chinas problems and will it collapse:China is facing a huge overcapacity problem. This is a direct result of the nation’s economic model which prioritized production over consumptionThe coastal regions in China are interlinked with the global economy; it has seen most of China’s rapid development and enriched a new breed of merchants, all at the expense of the rest of China. Most of China today remains largely agrarian, has little infrastructure and lives in poverty. The wealth China has made is in the hands of a few. According to the Institute of Social Science Survey's 2014 China Welfare Development Report, published by a research institute in Peking University, 1% of China’s households owned 33% of the nation’s wealth.The vast majority of Beijing's investment has been financed by debt, whether in the form of loans, bonds or other types of formal and informal lending. Most has come from state-owned banks: In 2015, outstanding bank loans equalled 141% of GDP, while outstanding bonds totalled 63% of GDP. All of this debt, especially the money that found its way into the country's housing sector, created a housing bubble which has now created deeper debt problems.China exports dried up during the global economic crisis in 2008. What China did to stave off an economic crisis was to produce and build well in excess of what it needs in steel, cement and housing. In the process, it has amassed the largest build up of bad debt in history. Researchers at a Chinese state planning agency said in 2016 that China has ""wasted"" $6.8 trillion in investment.Overcapacity is so significant in many sectors that it will take years for it to be absorbed by organic demand. Sound loans, by definition, result in commensurate GDP growth. So when private-loan growth outstrips GDP growth, much of that excess will be problem loans. Based on this formula, China today is likely to have an estimated $1.75 trillion to $3.5 trillion in problem loans—a figure well in excess of the $1.5 trillion of total capital in China's banking system.China's economy faces significant challenges and is a direct result of moving away from the growth model it relied upon for three decades to another model of growth that can sustain the growth needed to maintain social cohesionWill China’s economy collapse? it possible, this is why Xi Jinping has taken on dictatorial powers and done away with presidential terms, the expectation is there will be painful reforms ahead.But China can navigate through this with polices, which will be painful, but necessary.",40,0.10313916038142847,0.3993458546035864,0.9215338357720466

Let’s not forget, the Great Wall built in the 7th century BC was claimed by non-Chinese to be seen from the Moon, from the Low Earth Orbit and even from the Skylab!Again, unlike most other nations, the Chinese population will remain on steady rise, and always there will be enough Chinese to hold the Chinese sky up.

1134,"It’s not performing better.China, US, and EU have similar GDPs, a widely used metric for a nation’s total economic activity, in absolute terms and in PPP terms. However, China achieves this level of GDP with a population of 1.4 billion, while the US and EU are able to do so with 350 million and 500 million people, respectively.This means that on a per capita basis, the US economy is roughly 4x as productive and the EU economy is roughly 3x as productive as the Chinese economy. The difference is even bigger in exchange rate terms, more like 6x and 4x respectively.Recently, the Chinese economy has been growing a lot faster than the US and EU economies, but it’s much easier for a poor country to grow, percentage wise, than for a rich country to grow. China did a lot of catching up in the past few decades, building roads, factories, and cities where there were none before; learning from advanced countries how to do so rather than spending centuries figuring it out; and receiving lots of investments from already wealthy nations. These projects are relatively low risk, high reward, and typically don’t require a ton of innovation, just a lot of capital.The US and EU, on the other hand, are already advanced economies, so for them to grow economically, they have to come up with new technologies and new solutions to problems.However, as China developed economically, it has exceeded the EU and the US in some ways and has itself accumulated a lot of capital which can potentially be used for foreign investments.

I am not advising you to forsake buying Chinese products but to counter the move by improving our own production methods.

So the king ordered Prahlad and Holika (who was immune to fire) to sit on a pyre, a wooden structure for burning a body as part of a funeral or execution. When the flames struck, Holika burnt to death in spite of her immunity to fire, and miraculously Prahlad prevailed because he called on the help of Lord Vishnu.

1143,"Step back a bit. What is the impact of being dependent on any country’s product? It is not only China, though today China is the subject of this issue. If a country becomes too dependent on another without any countervailing economics, it will, of it’s own accord, eventually die economically. That’s why balanced trade is healthy for world economics. Case in point: The United States has a trade deficit in excess of $300 billion with China. It has had this problem building for at least the last 10 years or so. Why? There are several, but in generalizing, it is because the US doesn’t have competitive products to sell to China. Digging into the details, what is the US good at? Technology. What’s missing in US exports to China? Technology. Why? The US is fearful of technology transfer to China and it’s costs are high. Funny thing is that, on balance, what the US doesn’t supply to China, China gets from Europe, Israel, Russia, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan….technology product. What is the number one import to China from the US? Grains and their oils. What countries produce similar products? Most developing countries like Brazil, Argentina, Russia, Australia, etc. So, what’s the outcome? For the US, death by a thousand cuts. For China, replacement of US products that the US no longer produces or prices that make them uncompetetive. Trump has started a trade war by placing tariffs on solar panels, washing machines, steel, and aluminum. It would appear from past rhetoric and the US trade imbalance, his target is China. But, he missed. Though China is impacted, others are more impacted. In the case of solar panels, most panels imported into the US come from Malaysia and South Korea. The washing machines made by LG and Samsung are South Korean. The largest exporter of steel and aluminum into the US is Canada. He recently targeted European luxury cars. In my opinion, he has stirred up a storm. Why is he missing his intended target on trade? Is this just another transient crisis to move attention from what is bothering him? Is Mueller getting to close for Donald’s comfort? Is his world crumbling? His White House staff is leaving in droves, his estrangement with his wife, his declining popularity, North Korea and South Korea are negotiating without him, and the fear of what Mueller might bring out when the’ Russian collusion’ investigation ends. It just could be Trump’s false flag. So, while we are derailed with confusion, the real issue of trade imbalance continues to fester. The trade war that Trump is creating will probably make things for trade and our domestic economy worse. With tariff increases, domestic costs will rise. The ‘peanut’ increases to the middle class by the recent passage of the tax act will be nothing but an illusion.

1153,"Will the nuclear arms race between China and the USA, and the communist bullying by China of smaller economies globally, lead to the fall of the United Nations?Let us dissect the question, it can be breaking down to three parts; (1) It assumes that there is a nuclear arms race between China and the US, (2) It insinuates that China is bullying smaller countries, (3) It implies as a result of the above, that the UN will fall.All parts of this question are fundamentally weak.First: it presumed there is a nuclear race between China and the US. According to US experts’ estimates, China has about 250-400 nuclear war heads, which is only loose change compare to the US’s 7000+. China’s nuclear objective is defensive deterrent, that’s the reason why it is the only nuclear power to solemnly declare NO FIRST USE policy.China quietly observed the race between USSR and USA; if one country produced enough nuclear war heads to destroy the earth 10 times then the other will try its hardest to produce enough to destroy it 20 times, and the other will do it for 30 times and so on and so forth, which ended ( or at least contributed) with the collapse of the USSR more than a quarter century ago. China is too wise and pragmatic to enter into a race that it deemed a waste of resources and no winner.Second: China does not bully smaller countries; the perceived bullying by China reported in the western media is the exaggeration of the “China Threat” theory. As we all know, China has 14 neighbours; China has reached the border agreement with 13 of them through peaceful negotiations, smaller countries usually received more favourable terms. The only unresolved dispute is with India, the problem is too complicated to discuss here, but the main reason being the arbitrarily drawn border lines by the British, the colonial master of India, during a time when China was the “Sick Man of Asia” and when England was the empire where the “Sun Never Sets”, how equitable these border lines were drawn up is up to any body’s surmise. As for the south china sea disputes, China has historically claimed these islands; being the first to name them, first to explore them, being the first country to have thousands of fisherman making a living in thses waters etc. As recently as 1945, at the end of WW2, it was the US brought Chinese officials to reclaim these islands (China was so poor that it did not even have any sea worthy vessels),Third: Due to the fact that the US and the USSR did have a nuclear arms race during the cold war, and that the US has been bullying the smaller countries ever since the Monroe Doctrine, UN did not fall. Some super powers frequently disrespect the UN decisions (eg. invasion of Iraq wasn't authorized by UN) rendering it not able to function at its expected level or efficiency.

1154,"Another question from a parallel reality! I “love” these.First of all, China is not in a nuclear arms race with America. That was the Soviet Union. Yes, I know, the Soviet Union disappeared in 1991 and the Cold War has officially been over since 1989. So who's this nuclear arms race with again? Oh, that's right! Nobody. The arms race is over.China and the USA get along fine. They pretty much have a codependent relationship at this point as China's biggest trade partner is the USA and they rely on this trade to continue. Likewise, the USA is massively dependent on China. There is not a lot of room here for real conflict.As for China's “communist bullying” China is mainly engaged in capitalist hussling. Its relationship with many economies is one of “sell us resources please and we will invest in your country-big time”. It's classic capitalist deal-making.Of course the Chinese are happy to do business with autocrats and dictators. Business is business and the Chinese couldn't care less about politics- least of all communism. The Chinese openly advise governments to squash any communist rebels in their countries. Communism is bad for business.In everything they do, the Chinese do exactly what the US has always done, only without the hypocrisy of pretending to care about human rights.As for the United Nations, why would it fall? the UN keeps ticking along ad it always has, doing its projects and trying to ignore the fact that, on the level of international relations and diplomacy, it is largely a huge irrelevancy and has been for over 2 decades.",4,0.09386446886446889,0.42380952380952375,0.909167103822824

The US is still “advocating” that position.

As some other people had said, the ‘maximum terms’ practice is not necessarily the ‘norm’ anyway, USA has this but Germany hasn’t.In any case, the ‘fixed term’ practice does have certain ‘comforting’ factor, it is a safeguard in a way, which was why it is adapted in some countries.

1170,"Anbang, along with HNA and Dalian Wanda, has been the biggest buyers of non-productive assets offshore from China, using leverage to “expand” their holdings. This represented a risk to the stability of the Chinese financial system and the Chinese government promptly took actions. With HNA and Dalian Wanda, pressure with applied through the lenders, through squeezing working capital, forcing these reckless institutions to sell off-shore assets and reduce borrowings. In the case of Anbang, it was more difficult to go via this route because its source of funding was not the banking sector but the shadow banking arena. The authorities clamped down on shadow banking in the last 2 years, creating a liquidity problem for Anbang, but the CEO refused to shrink Anbang’s balance sheet, instead creating even riskier funding sources by tapping the “insurance” market, breaking the law.This gave the opening to for the authorities to take over Anbang, and I fully expect the bulk of Anbang’s foreign assets to be put on the block.

No more than any other country in any case.Many folks perceive that China makes cheap junk just because that’s all they can do when in fact they are catering to their customers. High-end products are just as likely to come out of China as Germany or the U.S. and these things will cost nearly the same regardless of origin. Forget the brand, look at the product characteristics.I think that it is closer to the truth that China is more willing to make cheap stuff than anyone else (except for Vietnam and India of course) and as such often gets a poor rap because of it… but guess what… they not only don’t care that they are perceived that way, the embrace it.As far as low-cost manufacturing in and of itself, there are many more government subsidies in China than anywhere else and where they have been found to “dump” product the Chinese product suddenly becomes priced nearly equally with other, domestic production. There is also the perspective that China doesn’t recognize patents of other countries, but China isn’t the only one that does it… they have simply learned to time their introduction of any offending items to the affected countries until the patent is ready to expire… or if the item has a high enough margin they may introduce it prior to the expiration of protections and pay whatever they have to in order to grab some market share,",3,0.08160714285714288,0.4945408163265306,0.9744410858348063

1190,"What you are seeing is called the “stopped clock theory of forecasting.” If you think about it, a stopped clock tells the wrong time most of the time but tells the right time twice a day. In the world of forecasting, what this translates to is that if you simply forecast the same thing all the time, eventually you will be right. You just have to keep saying the same thing until it finally happens.People don’t get attention by saying that “everything will be OK.” Journalists don’t run those stories, and people wouldn’t read them if they did. So even if most authentic forecasters believe that China will manage OK somehow, this probably wouldn’t make it to whatever web page or newspaper or whatever you’re reading. And even if it did, you probably wouldn’t notice or remember it. You would only notice the extreme predictions.Furthermore, one of the roles of analysts is to get publicity for their firms.

1215,"Yes, it is. China is expected to exceed US in retail consumption this year (2018).In 2015, Zhou Xiaochuan from China’s central bank said China’s personal saving rate is very high at 50%.worried that with high saving rate, there would be less money for investment. It would reduce the effective investment rate. He was pushing for reducing personal saving rate, i.e. increase consumption. In order to push for consumption or investment, the base interest rate was set below CPI. It aimed at driving out the savings for consumption or investment.There are still potential for China’s consumption to continue grow. One measurement the government is looking at is to reduce Gini index. The theory is that the need to spend money is there but the poor families don’t have enough money to spend. By reducing Gini index, the population at lower percentile are able to consume more.One way to do so is by transferring wealth to the poor. We can see in 2015, only less than 1% of GDP is transferred to the poorest population. There are still more room to improve in this category. There are a couple of experiments is carrying out in China right now, such as “free lunch” program, and several field test on 劳动收入奖励计划 (working income incentive plan).Meanwhile, the upgraded consumption is also a hot topic last year. It simply means consumers are no longer choose to buy the cheapest possible products, but willing to spend more money on better quality, better branded products, thus spend more.The consumption channel is also important factor to drive up spending. Although eCommerce continue to grow, China witnessed big transformation of malls. Malls in China used to be predominantly selling goods and for people to meet in the holidays and weekend. The malls took a hit years ago due to the rise of eCommerce. People simply shop online rather than shop at the malls. But in recent few years malls in China transformed into an social gathering (restaurants, cafes and desert stalls took up to half of the space), and offline experience center. The stores in the mall are simply meant to display, to showcase concept products, to build brand and for people to touch and feel. Many stores encourage visitors to scan the in-store QR code to follow now and buy online later. This way the store reduce the pressure for the consumers to buy immediately, in exchange open the channel to advertise future products online later. Today I went to a mall and saw a store advertising that you can buy in the store and deliver to your home for free.A2A.",65,0.06731926406926406,0.44562445887445906,0.9297562967781919

I believe, China is doing a great job implementing sharing economy into its system as I genuinely think sharing economy is the sustainable platform of the future.Nowadays, more and more Chinese people have larger desposable income to spend and add to their savings putting money aside.You may convert RMB to US dollars and you will get relatively low income per person every month but remember cost of living is incredibly low compared to western countries, especially in 2nd tier or 3rd tier cities.

Many of these questions set up the scenarios in a way that the Chinese military would have to go out of the country, dealing with a huge logistic burden, have the least amount of international support all while LaLaLand enjoys all the home advantages and international support.Intentionally setting up a war scenario that clearly grands LaLaLand all the advantages and makes China dealing with all their potentially realistic disadvantage, that is just super biased/unfair and unrealistic. Why not intentionally set up a scenario in which both countries have to deal with their respective advantages and disadvantages? Setting an unfair unrealistic scenario to grand victory to certain country is just a way to please one’s ego.Another example: Let’s say that you want certain job really bad, but you can’t make whole lot of process getting it. Watching others getting it will make you mad. To deal with this emotion, there are two ways: you either stop wanting that job, then others getting it doesn’t matter to you anymore, or you work harder and smarter finding a way to make more progress which will certainly makes you feel great. But what if you just simply have to have that job, but you still can’t make much progress after a ton of effort, and others are still getting that kind of jobs left and right?

Others countries really want those progress as well, but for one reason or another, unfortunately, they either can’t get it or have made relatively small progress.

I think the old guards like Ye Jinying 叶剑英, Chen Yun 陈云，etc who had spent their lives building the CCP and went thru the Long March would not let the hard earned fruit of their lives went away to the Lin Dynasty. Thus the scenario would be China would then remain poor for a few years and then some kind of taking power from Lin would occur. Would China disintegrate then?

1267,"Thanks for the A2A.By conventional wisdom, most would associate Chinese debt as being an internal debt problem as it is mostly by held by domestic institutions, individuals and corporations. This is because its Big 4 banks are very profitable global banks if you measure by assets and also the Chinese gross savings rate is very high at 46.4% (see link) which means China has a lot of liquidity out there to combat the debt problem. It is unlike Greece’s debt problem as its debts are held mainly by foreigners. Because if the debts are mostly domestically held and bank failures happen, the government can nationalise the local banks or the banks can merge together to recapitalise like what the Japanese banks did during its deflation.However, Chinese private sector enterprises do have problems getting loans from the state-owned banks since there are so many state-owned enterprises who need loans from such banks that crowd out the lending. So one way for these private sector enterprises is to borrow from foreign banks and because of the Belt-and-Road initiative (BRI), they could set up regional offices in these BRI countries and borrow monies from the overseas foreign banks.To understand the extent of such loan situation, one can look at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) data. BIS is an association of the central banks of many countries and we can look at the cross-border loans for some understanding.The Mar’18 BIS quarterly report did highlight some problems with the cross-border Chinese debt. The link is : https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/...As the report is quite long and so I just did a quick glance. In it, it was written “According to the BIS locational banking statistics, cross-border claims of BIS reporting banks more than quadrupled, totalling $2 trillion in 2017. Among the Asian EMEs, we restrict our focus to Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand, the countries at the epicentre of the AFC. We will refer to them as “emerging Asia”. Together, these five countries accounted for 69% of the region’s total cross-border credit in Q2 1997, and 24% in Q3 2017. The considerable decline in their regional share reflects the emergence of China as the largest borrower in the region from BIS reporting banks.”One thing to note that as the Chinese banks are also members of BIS, we do not know the extent of the problem as it is possible the Chinese private-sector enterprises do borrow from the Chinese banks which also have their presence overseas.So to answer your question, China does owe other countries money in the context that Chinese private sector enterprises are involved in cross-border loans and could be a big borrower.Also, one should anticipate that it is possible that some Chinese private-sector enterprises are over-leveraged and could face the possibility of bankruptcy as the global economy has many uncertainties now due to the the Fed’s monetary normalisation policy, strong US dollar, high debts of Emerging Markets, trade disputes etc. But I am optimistic that China could have a soft landing for its debt problem as highlighted by my below answers:David BK Tan's answer to Why are people so focused on the US debt, when Chinese debt is larger than the US as a percentage of GDP and is growing much more quickly (US has lessened since 2012, Chinese has grown 80%)?David BK Tan's answer to What are the Chinese economy’s true colors?",1,0.10158292282430212,0.2920829228243021,0.9524013128610085
1268,"China began its economic reform in the late 1970s and for roughly the first two decades, China was very much a developing country and took out soft loans from the World Bank for infrastructure development. Japan also provided project financing. These loans have been repaid long ago.Now China has been drawing their excess reserve to help other countries by financing the so called Belt and Road infrastructure projects. In addition to loans, China has also been actively engaged in bilateral swap agreements. A swap agreement between two countries allows the two parties to settle their bilateral trade in their own currencies and thus by-pass the need to buy dollars to pay for their trade.Not having to pay in dollars lowers transaction cost and at the same time erodes the importance of the dollar as the world reserve currency. By adjusting the exchange rate between the two currency in the swap agreement also allows China to extend friendly terms to the other country.",1,0.0732051282051282,0.4244871794871795,0.9900691834720715

1275,"The question is a bit tricky even tough I can barely guess what you want to point at, but it’s complicated to link your 2 statements.Firstly, Chinese isn’t an ethnic group, but by this, you must mean Han Chinese because they are the ethnic majority in China with around 92% of inhabitants in China and they lead and control China. While Chinese people in Southeast Asia have been mostly of Han descent, the Chinese diaspora in Southeast Asia isn’t the same in all countries. And it’s a minority except in Singapore.But as I previously said, if we take the case of Singapore, Chinese-Singaporeans don’t really have any link with Chinese people from current China. In fact, China has tried to support and push Malaysia to get a huge port to “kill” Singapore and its Port of Singapore which is something like the 2nd world busiest port in terms of tonnage and probably in the top5 for most valuable indexes when we speak about ports and maritime trades. Now, do Chinese-Singaporeans control Singapore? Yes, but they account for the majority in Singapore.If we take the case of Malaysia, it’s a bit different. Of course there are still some Chinese-Malaysians who hold more slices of the pie than other ethnic groups while Chinese-Malaysians aren’t the majority (those are Malay), but Chinese-Malaysians are closer to Chinese-Indonesians in terms of how they have gotten the pie. Bumi (Natives of Malaysia and Indonesia) have been under the British and Dutch colonial empires and they were stolen, discriminated (racial policies ) and sometimes dispossessed. Those 2 colonial empires put silly racial policies for so many decades and “imported” Chinese people (mostly Han Chinese) and allowed them to become merchants for example. While they were a minority in Malaysia and in Indonesia, they used to hold more economic power than Bumi. Things started to change with the anti-Chinese riots in Malaysia and in Indonesia, too. In Malaysia with the New Economic Policy (NEP) which is one of unique affirmative action in the world which targets the majority. The NEP in Malaysia (and then the NDP) started in 1971 when all Bumi combined, not only Malay, had only 4% of the wealth of Malaysia! At this time over 50% of Bumi were under the poverty line. Malaysian New Economic Policy - Wikipedia. In Indonesia it’s a bit harder to see, because there isn’t this kind of affirmative action but Chinese-Indonesians have benefited from the racial policies in the same way as in Malaysia for Chinese-Malaysians which was one of the reason that ethnic Chinese were targeted during the riots in 1998 in Indonesia. About 1,000 people died then and a lot of ethnic Chinese now use localized names instead of obviously Chinese names.Vietnam? It’s also very different. First, there is an anti-Chinese feeling in Vietnam, too. I won’t write about it. In Vietnam in the past, Chinese people were prosperous until 1975 when they had their businesses and properties confiscated by the Communists. Obviously many ethnic Chinese fled the country due to the restriction and persecution by the newly communist government. I don’t need to add that at this time China wasn’t as lovely and non-imperialist as some Chinese users on Quora try to promote, because speaking about Vietnam, we have to speak about the Sino-Vietnamese War which is linked with the The Cambodian–Vietnamese War when Vietnam invaded Cambodia which was led by Khmer Rouge and close to China A long story and it’s not the subject here. Nowadays, since the Vietnamese government's post-1988 has moved to an economic liberalisation, it has revived the entrepreneurial presence of the Chinese minority in urban areas, which has allowed them to regain much of their previous economic power in the Vietnamese economy.After Vietnam, we have to speak about Cambodia. Well, China has usually been a great support for Cambodia especially during the Khmer Rouge era, so even though there aren’t so many ethnic Chinese in Cambodia, overall they hold a wealthy life there. Chinese Cambodians are one of the most well-established middle classes and they are well represented in all levels of the society. Today, they hold the keys of the business sector and dominate most of the Cambodian economy, in addition to have one of the strongest presences in the Cambodia's political scene with many high ranking government officials. As well a lot of the political elite in Cambodia is of Chinese descent. In fact, ethnic Chinese nearly rule Cambodia in the economic pie with a population who accounts for less than 1% of the whole Cambodian population, even though in fact there must have more people of Chinese descent in Cambodia because in this country, Chinese people used to mix a lot with Khmer.Laos? Not so far of the Cambodian situation. With less than 2% of the population, overall, ethnic Chinese lead and dominate the Laotian economy. If someone wants to read a bit more: The Chinese in LaosRebirth of the Laotian Chinese Community as peace returns to Indochina - CEFCThailand? I think there is no real need to speak about this country as long as the largest Chinese diaspora in the world is in Thailand. As long as I don’t remember that Thailand and China share a physical border, if the largest overseas Chinese diaspora is in Thailand, it must be because they have a good life. The Philippines is a close case.I think I’m going to stop here, because although there are few other Southeast Asian countries, I think I’ve spoken for the most cases. If people are really interested by this topic and would understand the real and possible threat of this situation, they can search and read about the Chinese capitalism in Southeast Asia, or the overseas Chinese entrepreneurship, or the capitalist development in Southeast Asia etc…. There are several books and studies about this topic. I used to study it when I was younger because as a Pacific Islander who comes from 2 Pacific Islands, it’s an important subject and to study the Southeast Asian experience is worth. Eventually it’s going to happen in Africa and in Pacific Islands too, soon! Sadly Quora has become a place where anti-China and pro-China fight a lot so we cannot have any debate with some people without to be called Sinophobic for example when we want to criticise things related to China, so I won’t waste my time to write more because this kind of writing usually faces the same destiny hahaha.The fair question is do you know any other ethnic group who dominates the economy in so many countries? We aren’t speaking about the West colonialism here, but about migrations of people who have “erased” the concurrence, taken the control and dominated the economy of countries where they are the an ethnic minority. And please, don’t come to give some arguments like the work ethic, etc… because most historical cases like Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia or Pacific Islands have showed that it was usually linked to a colonial era.

This leads to more paper work and an inspector raj .Also after independence Indian education concentrated on making more and more managers and highly skilled engineers. So we have good managers respected world wide employed even as head of Pepsi, Microsoft etc. But we ignored vocational training and so we lost out on skilled low tech work force. The government under Modi is trying to meet this deficiency by Skill India programme.The actions of the present Modi government in amending labour laws, reducing factory inspections by inspectors, Mudra loan etc will go a long way in addressing the competitiveness of the Indian manufacturing industry .Dr. Sayeesh Pillai",1,0.2501984126984127,0.389484126984127,0.8842362883677817

1296,"Yes. But definitely not so fast.Foreign investments in China came mostly from Hong Kong, Taiwan, two already developed Chinese economies.

Economic Sanctions on China were suicide, ruining western companies’ short-term interest and losing ideological struggles in the long run.The west, believing China is sure to fall owing to its system of government, has never forecast such a sustainable developing China as it is today.

1298,"China collapse? That’s laughable. As I wrote here, like every other economy and country in history, China will continue to experience its fair share of bumps in the road (and outright wrecks). But China isn’t going to collapse… and in fact, just the opposite is a lot more likely: China’s soon (to the extent it isn’t already) going to lead the world.Of course, a lot of people don’t believe that. That’s because in recent years, China has been a convenient go-to excuse when markets or economies are bad. For example talking heads claim that China’s banking sector is in trouble (we don’t believe that)… or that debt levels in China are too high (we think the media is getting this story wrong)… and that China’s real estate bubble is going to pop (again, we don’t believe this). These storylines have put food on the table for financial journalists for years.There is truth in some of this. For example, it’s a statistical inevitability that China’s economic growth is slowing. Something that’s already very big, whether it’s an economy or a company, can’t continue to grow at a rapid pace forever. And over the past 15 years, China has become the world’s second-biggest economy.China’s economic growth has slowed to 6.5 percent a year, down from an average of 10 percent a year from 1991 to 2015. But that still means that China’s economy is adding 6.5 percent to US$10 trillion each year. That means, even at 6.5 percent, China is adding the equivalent of four economies the size of Kuwait’s every year.As shown below, from 2000 to 2015, China’s GDP grew over 800 percent – more than any other large economy in the world. The current fastest-growing large economy, India, has “only” seen its GDP, or total economic output, grow by 335 percent over the same period.Although China’s economy has grown dramatically, on a per capita basis it’s still small, given the country’s population of 1.3 billion people.The U.S. and Singapore are still way ahead by this measure. The average GDP per capita (which is roughly a measure of how much wealth is created per person) in the U.S. is over US$55,800. For Singapore, it’s nearly US$53,000. China’s GDP per capita is only just over US$7,900.So there’s still plenty of growth left for China.In fact, we believe China is just beginning a giant boom – similar to the one the U.S. went through in the 1950s.China’s economic growth today is like America’s in 1950In 1950, the U.S. was already an industrial and economic power. It also was in the midst of a post-war consumption frenzy. The baby boomer generation was just getting started – and this turned into a demographic trend that shaped the U.S. economy for the rest of the 20th century.Then the government started encouraging Americans to spend more “for the good of America.” The U.S. government wanted to engineer domestic consumption – that is, to get people to spend more money buying things. In 1954, U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower reduced personal taxes to help households “increase purchasing power.” It helped that during his presidency, from 1953-1961, personal incomes in the U.S. increased 45 percent.This extra income meant Americans had more money to spend on appliances, fancy clothes, entertainment and other non-essentials. Spend they did… and they still haven’t stopped.This post-war boom led to the creation of the largest middle class the world had ever seen. And it pushed the U.S. economy to the next level to become a global behemoth.But the U.S. middle class is no longer the largest in the world. That title now goes to China.Like the U.S. in 1950, China is already an industrial and economic power. It has been the world’s manufacturing centre for over a decade. And China is home to the world’s second-largest economy.It also has the world’s largest middle class. It’s expected to be over half a billion people by 2020. This booming middle class is also earning more money and has more disposable income – just like the baby boomer generation that started taking shape in mid-20th century America.And the Chinese government, like the U.S. government in the 1950s, is encouraging Chinese consumers to buy more stuff, for the good of China’s economy. So, even though China’s economic growth has been miraculous for the past 20 years, it isn’t over yet.As global investment firm Goldman Sachs recently said about China’s economic growth, “What the world has seen so far is only a preview of the opportunities to come.”What could happen to China’s economic growthTo give you an idea of the “opportunities to come,” look at the chart below. The black line shows the extraordinary growth in GDP per capita in the United States from 1960 to 2015, when America was the engine for the global economy. During that time, GDP per capita in the U.S. grew 1,757 percent.The blue line represents China’s GDP per capita from 2000 to 2015 (using the x-axis at the top of the graph). Notice how closely it tracks America’s historical growth from 1960 to 1976.As you can see, China’s GDP per capita is about where U.S. per capita GDP was in 1976. But, U.S. GDP per capita growth took off from there. Now, 40 years later, U.S. GDP per capita is over US$55,000.If China follows a similar pattern to the U.S., its economy still has a lot of growth ahead of it. Of course, it won’t happen in a straight line and there will be some dramatic ups and downs. But it does give you an idea of what could happen.So: China, collapse? No. In fact, China is the place to be invested right now.This was written by Stansberry Churchouse Research, an independent investment research company based in Singapore and Hong Kong that delivers investment insight on Asia and around the world.

1300,"As an outsider, I find the discussion on China's collapse very interesting. Even though I am of ethnic Chinese, I try to view the issue objectively.However, my interest mainly focus on the views expressed by Gordon C Chang, who first came into great fame with his book on Collapse of China in 2001. Ever since then he had been predicting the Collapse again and again.In an article in Oct 17, titled “Smart money on Bannon as he takes on China” Chang believed then that Steve Bannon who was supposed to be a key person in Trump's election success, and later in policy of White House, would be a force in bringing down China.Why? Because Bannon had been dismissed from White House and so was free to wreck havoc on China. He cited as evidence of the power of Bannon his stunning success in getting Ray Moore on the Republican ticket in the primary. This was, to Chang, ominous sign to bring down China, no less.People who follow American politics recently would know that Bannon wanted to take revenge against the current Republicans because they didn't give enough support to Trump. So now that he was out of White House, he had the power redirected at the Chinese.Come Nov 17, Ray Moore lost the election, and Bannon left Breitbart, his main channel to fire his fury, Chang had not come up with another person to bring China to her knees.With the great power of Bannon and the great foresight of Chang, we wait for the imminent fatal wound to China to break it into smithereens.I wonder what it was and is the fury in Chang that he would like to see the suffering of 1.3 billion people whose blood he share a part of?Realistically, things are not all rosy in China as we canvas news from various sources. Even China's central Banker warned of excessive credit which may be unsustainable. But their debt is internal, and with high savings, they have sufficient funds if and when things get bad. There won't be any need for IMF or other institutions to lord over them. The worst comes to the worst, they have US treasury bills to sell. Wouldn’t that bring US to collapse?China may collapse economically in future, but I believe it will be long after I and Chang are gone.",25,0.06679751179751178,0.41695409695409696,0.8905375742536638

1302,"It's 3:28 in the morning, I had a Coke, and I can't fall asleep. I have been thinking how to answer this question. I can answer it like a redneck being angry and curse from the very first letter to the last, or like a bystander who doesn't care at all and simply reply: this is dumb as hell, or take a deep breath and try to come up with something solid. Afterall, someone requested me to answer this question, out of nowhere, I guess.This is a question that cannot be answered, simply because it is a future prediction. If I can predict the near future including events big like “will China collapse this year” or “when will xi die”, will I still be here wasting my time answering quora questions like such? Don't you think investing all my money on stocks, lottery, bettings to make huge profits; warning people in advance of devastating natural disasters to save lives; guiding the human being to a correct direction with scientific discoveries to achieve a better future would all be very meaningful and practical things for me to do? To spend my sleep time on?In 1991, on Christmas Eve, did a normal citizen living in Minsk know a few moments later, he shall no longer address himself a Soviet but a Belorussian. I think the answer is no. Even with long term economical struggles and not so productive reforms, not many have foreseen the collapse of the USSR. How would a normal person with some critical thinking skills say or even to think that today’s China will collapse in 2018? It's not 2028 2038 48 58 or 3018 you are talking about.When you open a world history book, you can find that China has the longest continuous history with more than 3500 years of written history, out competing every single civilization on this planet. And among this 3500 years, only two periods were officially considered to be a shattered China, and when combined, it is less than 400 years. Throwing out a rough equation, 3100/3500=88.6%, at least for 88.6% I wake up the next morning and I see a unified China. Of course, this is such a silly calculation, so many factors are ignored here, but if you add every detail in, I guess I need a super computer with a great programmer creating a precise algorithm. I probably will end up with a result of “99.999% impossible” as the answer to this question.China's military has more than 2.5 million active personnels plus 2 million reserves, not worth mentioning the population of China is still the largest in the world. And China is famous for its human wave tactics, the Americans have suffered much in Korea, the Vietnamese also have seen it on our neighboring borderlines in the 70s to the 90s. Oh, yes, it's the 21st century, we don't just fight with more numbers of people. Do you know China is the only country that holds H-bombs in the world today? With conventional powered subs, China is able to re-strike after being nuked. Though much smaller military compared to the US, China is strong enough to sufficiently protect itself. China collapse due to external military invasion seems unlikely.What about trade war? With the largest population and 3rd largest landmass. I believe we are big enough to digest our market internally if trade wars were declared with international sanctions. Yes, our lives would be hard without ease, possibly be like living in the 90s again, but to collapse within a year? Seems hard, too.What about internally? I don't want to write too much as this answer is like an essay already. Dictarship or totalitarianism, whichever you call it. A country without history of great kings, emperors, rulers do not and cannot understand a system like the one party system that China has. Plus the general thoughts from the people that as long as we have food, shelter, live in a busy but decent life, we can get along with it. We sure have our problems, but to call a revolution and bring in the socalled democracy is probably not gonna happen. Not only there's regulations and means to counter from the government, but also there are rational citizens (I consider myself one) who don't welcome western democracy. No one wants China to be another Syria/Afghanistan/Iraq/Libya/Somalia.I’d like to end here with two quotes, one from the movie Blade runner and one from China's current president Xi. He made this comment about 7 years ago before he was the president.1 Blade runnerI've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched c-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhuser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain.2.

It is more important to realize this is one of the troll questions that are dumb and ignorant. But on the other hand, it would be a boring world without questions like such.

1306,"It’s impossible to say. Don’t listen to the people that argue too hard in either direction - they can only guess. While I doubt China will collapse in 2018, I’d say that the system will either change politically (which the CCP is unwilling to let happen) or else the economy will give in in the next decade or so. First of all, we need to see that the statistics are not on China’s side unfortunately. Other than oil-dependent city states, there are ZERO cases of countries that have moved beyond middle-income status without opening up and democratising. ZERO. This relationship between political systems and economic status is an extremely firm finding in the social sciences. Take a country like Singapore - the least democratic high-income country. It is, in fact, far more democratic than China is today. It is also a city-state which makes monitoring costs of things like corruption very low. It also has proper rule of law, where the legal system constrains the government and gives people clear rights. The CCP is unwilling to transition to such a system because it could ultimately mean the end of CCP rule.Another problem is the system is fundamentally corrupt, according to scholars like Minxin Pei. China has a highly publicised anti corruption campaign. But can such a system really take care of corruption? Probably not. China allows no oversight or transparency. It does not have proper rule of law. And third parties may not be involved in any such corruption investigation. Without these, getting rid of corruption is literally impossible. It’d be like me investigating myself for corruption. It’s nonsensical. It’s especially impossible because it happened after Xi Jinping came in and got rid of the institutional foundation that has been developing since Deng Xiaoping. So I have yet to hear an explanation of how China can actually get rid of corruption in its current system - it always requires a leap of faith.",7,-0.07481182795698924,0.43927419354838704,0.9751093930538481

1309,"“Entitlement Complex” came from the Chinese Communist Party’s propaganda.Admittedly during Deng and Jiang governments [1980–2003] this line of thought was not being thrust forward to the masses.During Hu government era of great growth and prosperity [2003–2013], the General Secretary and State media tried to get its voice heard on the global stage after the 2008 Summer Olympics and after the 2008 USA Economic Recession, but those were shot down and ignored by the international governments, just mentioned in the global press, despite China being the 2nd largest global economy!So 2011–12, China’s navy began aggressively extend its territory by invading and occupying the Philippine’s Spratly Island possession.The current Chinese leader Xi has extended Chinese people’s right and dreams as global leaders and inherent divine, natural order to dominate the world as it had 200+ years ago- - 中国, the middle kingdom.Over 200 years ago, China had the globe’s largest economy and was the East Asian bully. Back then the Emperor’s (government) appreciated tribute, kowtow and other rather superficial method’s of global acknowledgement as a powerful and the richest global nation.The Chinese government has matured its ambitions and is seeking to be the next world’s next and even more powerful hegemone.

1310,"The size of an economy is a reflection of its capacity to produce. This is based on more than just wealth/materials, as raw materials are not finished products. As such, largely populated countries have larger economies assuming they have at least average efficiency. USA and China have extremely large populations which means they are able to have large production capacity, which creates a large economy.A rich country is one with a large amount of wealth, and this is relative to the population. If a country has a lot of raw materials relative to their population, they have excess. Being rich implies having excess. So small countries and ones with low population density are at an advantage (ones with small populations relative to size, which tends to be smaller countries or ones in harsh environments). These countries are rich because they have commodities that they can sell or exchange for whatever they want. Commodities can include farmed goods, energy, raw materials, or simply shiny things that other countries need or want at the time.Think of it as if it were a family rather than a country. A family with a lot of people in it that all work hard and long will be very productive. This family will have a large “economy”. If you have a small family that just owns a lot of land and has raw materials, they wouldn’t have the same capacity to produce (… they would have a smaller “economy”), but they would be considered rich because they could trade for everything they need.A truly rich country is one where the citizens do not need to work in order to keep their standard of living high. Canada, Australia, Saudi Arabia are examples of countries that can live at a high standard of living simply selling raw resources to countries with larger economies. The amount of resources they have for each citizen is so high that slowly selling off a small portion at a time results in the income the country receives per citizen being high enough to buy what is needed.These countries depend on trade (as do large economies that do not have enough raw resources). USA and China both have a large amount of raw resources, but they have large populations as well so per capita they do not have as much wealth. They are the same as the large family which has to work for its income. Some countries are extremely small with very few people living in them, but have a large portion of the worlds materials (or a large portion of one type of material i.e. diamonds in central Africa, or oil in Venezuela)… these countries are “rich” but still not considered rich because they do not have access to the materials or the ability to trade them. So it’s a little more complex than just having, you also need to control and trade. That is however beyond the scope of this question.",0,0.041206390228129344,0.4299938949938947,0.905886917834332
